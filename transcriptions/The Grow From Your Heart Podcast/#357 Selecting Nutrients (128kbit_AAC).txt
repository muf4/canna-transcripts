[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 357 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Fatso II live
batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of GMO and Legend
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it is described as dark
roast coffee, garlic, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely agree with that
description, but I may add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: underarm and onions to that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a rank after smell to this
that I know it sounds disgusting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is really inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I opened up this concentrate and let
you smell it, you'd go, oh, that is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you dab it, it leaves this
really savory aftertaste that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives me crazy cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a concentrate give me cotton
mouth like that in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got a really nice heavy high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sat me back in the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me just kind of sit here and stare
into the computer screen for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds before I started recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice buzz and I really
enjoy the Fatso II live batter from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of information for you in
this podcast, so let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the sixth grow lesson
in a long series of lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to talk about
selecting your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new listener, if you're a new
grower, I suggest you head back to episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 351 and start listening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a solid foundation on
setting goals for your grow, selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: your space and selecting your equipment
for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced grower or if
you've been listening, let's get right
[SPEAKER_00]: into selecting nutrients for your new
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting nutrients or fertilizers for
your new garden can be very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be very intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients and fertilizers are the most
heavily advertised product in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you have the grow set up,
your nutrients will probably be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive recurring cost you have in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to guide you on
selecting nutrients without recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: specific brands, without recommending
specific products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to pitch anything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to steer you any specific
direction, but I want to give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea and a good understanding of what to
think about when you are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: customize your garden for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of nutrient companies
out there and countless ways to amend and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little bit of trial and
error to dial in what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to run one nutrient brand
for your first grow and a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different line for your second grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes when you do things like that
and then you can compare what you liked
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one nutrient company will give you
better flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One nutrient company is going to give you
better yields and one will probably give
[SPEAKER_00]: you better potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find the company that does all
three of those and works with your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style, that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the cannabis industry is filled with
egos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody tell you you are
choosing the wrong line because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are satisfied with the
outcome and you are okay with the ethics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the company you are giving your money
to, you can use whatever nutrients you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beauty of building your own
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the options
when it comes to selecting nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the grow store,
the number one thing they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pitch to you is bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow stores love to sell bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different types of bottled
nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got salt-based bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your big brand names are
salt-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also organic bottled nutrients
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies boast about having
fully organic wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are veganic options available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means there are no animal products
in an organic lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we can always do a
combination of organics and synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a nice balance to find
there and make sure that none of our
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic salt-based nutrients are going
to destroy anything in our organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no problem using them
together once you understand that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the pros and
cons of bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A moment ago, I said you can choose
whatever brand you like as long as you are
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with their ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a consumer, it is our responsibility to
understand what the companies we support
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the money we give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't agree with the way a company
operates, if you don't agree with things a
[SPEAKER_00]: company supports, you do not have to shop
with that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to spend your money with a company who
supports cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep your money on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to spend your money with a company
who is unethical, with a company who is
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly destroying the world, with a
company who is slowly poisoning mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to selecting nutrients,
do a little bit of research about the
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do research about their parent company.
[SPEAKER_00]: See who owns that company and find out
who's at the top of the food chain and see
[SPEAKER_00]: who you're giving your money to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just added a whole new step to
your selection process, but that is my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility is to make you guys think
about stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the ethics of the company
you are spending your money with when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're selecting your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about the pros and
cons of bottled nutrients specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we even get started, I know that
bottled nutrients are not for everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I also know that amended soils and
living soils are not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a living soil guy,
if you're an organic guy, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably already pulling your hair
out saying, Jeff, don't recommend bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: to new growers, but you've got to keep in
mind, not everybody is able to run a no
[SPEAKER_00]: till grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is able to set up a living
soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some people may just want to do
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a chemistry student or your mind
thinks that way, maybe you want a
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring device and a bottle of liquid to
measure and then mix and then balance the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's fun for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're more of a biology student,
you're more into horticulture and more
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to make the preamended
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about doing it your way and what
makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with bottled
nutrients, the pros to bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros to bottled nutrients are they are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to a grow store and they are on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Amazon and they are right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major advantages to bottled
nutrients is that they are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage to bottled nutrients is
an available nutrient feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the reputable nutrient companies
have a website that includes a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator or a nutrient feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You type in how many weeks you're going to
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You type in how many weeks you're going to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that website makes a custom nutrient
regimen to fit your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week one of veg, it will tell you week
one, feed this nutrient at this rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll say week one, use your base
nutrients at 25 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use CalMag at five mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use whatever else at this many mils per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know week one, it's all right here
listed out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two, what do I need to feed on week
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says 25 mils of this, 10 mils of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you select a brand, you buy their
lineup, you go to their website,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got basic instructions on how to
mix that brand for optimal results for
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will need to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all plants are the same, but they give
you a pretty good guideline on how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those companies want you to buy
more bottles more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always reduce the recommended
dosage, maybe 50%, maybe use 75%,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no need to start off at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the whole recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more, you can add more,
but you can never take out once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're burnt, they are burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at maybe 50 to 75% of the
recommended dosage on those schedules and
[SPEAKER_00]: then increase as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you get more experienced with the
plants, you will start to see if they need
[SPEAKER_00]: less or more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really handy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nutrient calculator on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learning to grow with bottles can be
very easy because of the accessibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: these websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about bottle nutrients
is easily repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the ratios of each element in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wrote down how much we fed each
nutrient, each feeding time, and we also
[SPEAKER_00]: documented the pH of those feedings,
we should be able to have repeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: results using the same product every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will need similar environmental
factors in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need the same temperature and the
same humidity and the same VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as long as nothing changed too
drastically in your grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to repeat your last feeding
schedule and your crop should come out
[SPEAKER_00]: with similar quality to the last harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, those are some of the pros of
working with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nutrient schedules available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly easy to work with and they
are reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the cons to
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the cons to working with bottled
nutrients are all related and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have a bunch of plastic bottles
that is environmentally unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are shipping plastic bottles
filled with water across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the nutrients we are buying are 80
to 90% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are basically paying a truck driver
to drive his truck across the country to
[SPEAKER_00]: haul plastic bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once that bottle gets to us,
we have it for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We throw away or recycle that plastic
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recycling center in my area will not
take plastic bottles that had nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to be thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside is that we're shipping
plastic bottles filled with water and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're throwing plastic bottles in a
landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the reasons to not use bottled
nutrients are environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are environmentally based and
sustainability based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the cons to working with
bottled nutrients are environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is,
are you going to know how to grow when
[SPEAKER_00]: those bottles go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow store is to close and society
falls apart and we have to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually farming, are you going to
understand how to farm your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or are you going to be stuck
reaching for bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the organic and the no-till
guys really laugh at the bottle growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the pros and cons of working
with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're shopping for bottled
nutrients, don't be sold by cool packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and fancy logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when it comes to selecting
nutrients, if you're a new grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you stick with one brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to buy base nutrients from one
company, Cal Mag from another company,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bloom booster from another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will lead to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to quickly explain why this
could become problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each company breaks down the required
elements for your plants in different
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles, different packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of these elements can be mixed
together in a bottle and some cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed together in bottles, so they've got
to make two different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies want you to buy 30
different bottles so that you can dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: that mix to have exactly as much nitrogen
as you want, exactly as much phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly as much potassium, while other
companies will mix the nitrogen in one
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle and the phosphorus and potassium in
another bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that because it's easier than
having 30 bottles for your nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each company knows what is in each
product they are putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that if they put out a base and
a bloom booster and you use them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know they did not double up on any
specific element in those two bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you grab a base nutrient from one
brand and a bloom booster from another
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, they never spoke to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be doubling up and adding too much
of one element to your plants and not even
[SPEAKER_00]: realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I recommend picking one
brand and sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with loyalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has to do with making sure you do
not double up and burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got one more note about bottle
nutrients I want to discuss before we move
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants require 16 elements for healthy
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants require carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those come from the air and the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen comes from the air and the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, our plants want phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur, boron, chlorine, copper,
iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the necessary elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the nutrients you are buying
have all of those required elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are covering most of your bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would recommend adding an
enzymatic product, some sort of enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to help, some sort of carbs are
going to help, and I always recommend some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of root love, some sort of beneficial
microbes, some mycos, beneficial fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria for your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may also need a PK booster,
a bloom booster later in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't need a whole bunch of
unnecessary ingredients for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're getting these 16
elements, maybe some enzymes, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: carbs, and I would always recommend some
sort of a root inoculant, your plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the guy at the grow store sell
you stuff because he works on commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the bottles at the grow store
sell you stuff because they have really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool logos and they're well advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a farm supply store,
everything comes in a white bag with black
[SPEAKER_00]: writing, and it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that fancy labeling and packaging
is just something to charge you extra for,
[SPEAKER_00]: so don't fall for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next part of my note says to
discuss my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to talk too much about specific
brands in here, so I'm not going to go too
[SPEAKER_00]: far in detail, and I may not even say
specific brand names, but you may catch
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started growing, I used a
very popular brand of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are that company that has about 40
bottles available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought all 40 bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun mixing and dialing in
that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that stuff for two or three years,
and I got really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to pull over two pounds from a
normal thousand watt light in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: basement grow reliably using this
company's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, everything I grew with that
product tasted and smelled and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grew OG Kush and Super Lemon Haze in
the same room with this nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would both smell and look fairly
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be a lot of weed and it would
be really potent, but you could barely
[SPEAKER_00]: tell that I grew two different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I switched to another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was known to be their competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company still had quite a few
bottles, but not as many.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this company was not nearly as
expensive as the brand I had tried before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started using their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell a few weeks in that I was not
satisfied with that product either.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants were looking colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell a huge difference in each
varietal, but there was not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the weight or potency that I'd gotten from
the previous brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I had to get rid of that
product and move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been doing a lot of research and I had
fallen in love with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I told you I wasn't going to
talk about a lot of brands, but Botanicare
[SPEAKER_00]: did a really good job for me for a really
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dialed in a beautiful Botanicare recipe
with a couple of additives and I grew some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best cannabis I have ever smoked
with Botanicare nutrients and a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was ecstatic with my results from
Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I noticed something started changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were changing their recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one day they announced that they had
sold their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noticing that the recipe was changing and
that my plants weren't as happy as they
[SPEAKER_00]: had been with that product before already
had me looking into another product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also working in commercial grows and
experimenting with other product lines in
[SPEAKER_00]: those grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being exposed to commercial grows and the
options to run so many different products
[SPEAKER_00]: on so many different levels, let me see
what worked and what did not work for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that Botanicare was changing
their recipes and then discovering that
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare had sold their brand to
Hawthorne, who is one of those companies I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke of earlier, that we would rather not
support, I had to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been using a powdered nutrient
system in a commercial grow for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: while and I was ecstatic with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had also been learning to use another
bottled nutrient system in that grow and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was completely satisfied with their
results as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, over time, I realized that the
powdered nutrient company was lacking just
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of things that I could probably
boost up my production if I added a few
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a couple of products from that
bottled nutrient line and added those to
[SPEAKER_00]: my powdered nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by using two different nutrient
companies, I have created a stellar
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient program for my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier, I did say that I would
recommend you stick to one brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: but once you learn the plants and you
learn about the nutrients, you'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to customize your mix to as many brands as
you like, as long as you understand what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been trying to avoid giving you
brand names and specific product names,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I already know I'm going to get a
bunch of emails if I don't tell you what I
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to spill the beans and
tell you that I use Veg Bloom powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients as my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Veg Bloom HD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get into flower, I start
adding two grams of Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we get later into flower,
I will increase the Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten up to four grams of Shine per
gallon on some strains and they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the Veg Bloom mix, I also add a little
bit of New Millennium products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the Ruby, the fulvic acid from New
Millennium, and I also use the carbonary
[SPEAKER_00]: area, the carbs from New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm adding a little fulvic acid to
increase uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding a little bit of carbs to give
more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also add SLF 100 enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plants show me that they need
more CalMag, we use Cali Magic from GH in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is basically my nutrient schedule
for a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my rant on bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about amended soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about living soil and we'll
kind of touch on no-till environments as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have as much experience in this
realm, so I will not have as many details
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, but I'm sure that I'll be able to
give you a good enough breakdown to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you make your decision in selecting your
nutrient or your fertilizing style for
[SPEAKER_00]: your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about what I
mean by living soils and super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more natural, more sustainable
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your super soil can be as simple or as
elaborate as you want to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of recipes for usable
super soils online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making your own living soil can be very
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are basically combining dried
amendments with soil or a soilless mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it the proper conditions and time
to cook and become alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I would do it is throw a large
tarp on the garage floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put out the amount of soil that I
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add all the dried amendments on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use a shovel and or a pitchfork to
stir that up real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it's all mixed up, you add it to
a trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to add a little bit of
moisture to your new concoction just to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put the lid on the trash can and
store it in a warm area and wait about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, all of those amendments will
start breaking down in that soil and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will create a living environment in that
trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take the lid off of that trash
can, if you see a white layer of moldy
[SPEAKER_00]: funk on top of the dirt, that is exactly
what we are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have created living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have basically mimicked what Mother
Nature does inside of a small container
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are giving the plants exactly what
they would want without force feeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that they do not want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on the mineral content of
your newly made soil, you may need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of uncharged soil to your
pots when you're putting new plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there because that fresh soil may be a
little too potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a little too rich and you may
need to cut it down to reduce burning your
[SPEAKER_00]: new baby plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about when
working with the living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit about the
pros and cons of a living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main, the best part is that it is
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everything you put in there is
organic, you have got an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those dried amendments come in a
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That box is either compostable or
recyclable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's not a bunch of water in that
box to ship around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are getting the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product goes into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The box goes into recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very minimal waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those meals are actually waste
products that we are reusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are actually recycling and putting a
waste product to use by putting it in our
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge advantage of living soil
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you start running a living soil
or an organic garden, you will also
[SPEAKER_00]: probably end up creating a compost bin in
your home, which will also create more
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental awareness, which will just
cause a chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start growing organically,
you'll start seeing things on a more
[SPEAKER_00]: organic level in your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will affect your eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will affect your shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start thinking about the earth
differently as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the benefits and also
some of the side effects of growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start working into like a no-till
environment, another huge advantage is
[SPEAKER_00]: very minimal waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to no-till, there is
essentially no waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a no-till environment, you harvest a
plant, you hang the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets trimmed and dried and cured and
consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waste goes back into your compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pot where we just cut that plant out
of, we're going to gently cut the root
[SPEAKER_00]: ball out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that big root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to put another clone in
that spot and we're going to backfill that
[SPEAKER_00]: with composted dirt that we've got in our
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got a fresh plant ready to
go with zero waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge advantage to a no-till
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: People growing cocoa or growing soil,
they've got to figure out how to either
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle or get rid of all of that cocoa or
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got more than four or five
three gallon pots worth of used cocoa or
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, it becomes a challenge to try to get
rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just dump it in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to notice that big fresh
pile of dirt with a bunch of perlite in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to say,
perlite, what's he doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to just start triggering
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's hugely advantageous to not have
any waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to no-till gardening,
another huge advantage is there are
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal bug threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like when you establish a no-till
garden, it comes right along with
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do introduce any spider mites
or unwanted pests, those beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects are already there and they'll
creep in and destroy the population before
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a good thing with a
no-till garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Frosty was on the show a while
back and he was talking about going hiking
[SPEAKER_00]: and then walking right into his no-till
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, bro, don't you kind of worry
about maybe gathering a spider mite on
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoe and taking spider mites into
that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, bro, that's just food for the
predator mites that are already in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the no-till guys seem to be fairly
confident in their pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the major advantages to a
living soil or an organic system are it is
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everything you put in there is
organic, you know that everything comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow shop burns down, if Amazon
shuts down, if you learn how to grow like
[SPEAKER_00]: a farmer, when the shit hits the fan,
you'll be one of the few people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your own food and growing herb for
us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes right along with what I call
a side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start becoming more aware of what
you're doing to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go grocery shopping, you'll find
yourself in the produce section trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy more things that have something you
can add to your compost bin after you eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will totally affect the way you
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you eat and the way you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you head into the no-till range,
another huge advantage is minimal waste
[SPEAKER_00]: and very minimal pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we've got our living soil
established and we've got our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: going, if we do notice some sort of a
deficiency, there are ways that we can add
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to our organic system without
introducing bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to brew up a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean and Jesse have talked about compost
teas a lot on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go too deep into making a
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically throw amendments in a bucket
and add an aerator and you let it bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: for a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, depending on the strength of the tea
and the type of tea we made, we either
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute it or we water it directly into the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everything you used to make
your tea was organic, your grow is still
[SPEAKER_00]: fully organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option for adding nutrients to a
slowing organic garden is to top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can place organic amendments on top of
the soil and water them in just like you
[SPEAKER_00]: would a bottled nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not work as rapidly as it would
when using bottled nutrients because you
[SPEAKER_00]: will need time for the organic amendments
to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But top dressing is certainly a way to add
nutrients to an organic living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: without introducing bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've set up a living soil or a
super soil and you see those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: slowing down, or if you see those plants
are showing you some type of deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to brew up a compost
tea or top dress with the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment to add the missing element that
those plants will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things I have heard Jesse and Sean talk
about top dressing quite often are fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, kelp meal, alfalfa, and comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now before I get myself too far off
track, let's talk about some of the cons
[SPEAKER_00]: of working with a living soil or a super
soil type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside is the mix work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a space to mix this,
if you don't have a space to cook the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, it might not be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a lot of space to create this
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it does take a trash can worth of
space to store this soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that leads me right into the next
part, which is the cook time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you decided you want to start a
garden and you're going to start it next
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least 30 days to brew up a
batch of super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were already running late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside is the cook time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to let it cook and come alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another disadvantage to working with a
super soil or a living soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the richness of the soil you
just made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that soil too hot for little plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be okay for little plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: A new grower may not have the eye to see
if those plants are having problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't know how to identify it and
they won't know how to prevent or correct
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue if they see it in a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disadvantage to working with a
living soil is if you do have a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, you are very limited on approaches
for eradicating your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to stick to organic options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a soil pest problem,
your options are very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said earlier, you shouldn't
encounter too many problems in an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: soil environment because we've got enough
microorganisms there to keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: check.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do end up with a root problem,
you are very limited on ways you can
[SPEAKER_00]: treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot treat your living soil with a
root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were running a soil garden and you
were feeding with bottled nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: you ran into a root drench, root problem
like a root pest, you would be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a root drench with a pesticide,
either Botanogard Max or Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mix up 15 to 30 mls per gallon
and you water that right in with your
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding solution and that will eradicate
any soil borne pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go feeding Botanogard Max or
Evergreen to a living soil situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we basically destroy the entire
environment we worked to create in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something to keep in mind when
you were thinking about your nutrient and
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be able to implement your
integrated pest management system with
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient and soil selections?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all got to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are basically the pros and cons
of working with a living organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you've got an organic,
sustainable garden that should feel good
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real disadvantage that I can
think of when it comes to growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil or an organic type environment
is that it takes a lot of work ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work that has to happen
before you start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that work ahead may be exactly what
some people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're one of the people that enjoy
the smell of that rich dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the guy that enjoys mixing
all those amendments together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like having worm castings under
your fingernails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're into brewing your own compost
teas or waiting for your own fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: plant juices to ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what makes you happy with
your growth style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's all about your abilities and
what is available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a big city, maybe some of
those organic amendments won't be as
[SPEAKER_00]: available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a small city, a small farm
area, you'll have access to all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs, but you may not have
access to bottles and a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may come down to what's available in
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, most of us do have access to Amazon,
but not everybody can afford everything on
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to adjust to your budget
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point of your garden is to
produce a product that makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you are happy with your
garden, as long as you're having fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you're enjoying yourself,
and as long as you are getting a product
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end that makes you happy,
you are doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set up a grow that you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the scientist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be in there with a couple
of measuring devices and bottles and
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring out 15 mils of this and pour it
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's measure out 35 mils of this and
pour it in and mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's test the PPMs, see what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that looks real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you that guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you the guy that wants to mix up
everything at the beginning and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: add water and then just watch the plants
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the guy that wants to brew up
a bunch of teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're that guy making the fermented
plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be the scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are happy with your garden,
that's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are many more ways to feed your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are many more nutrient
styles and fertilizing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not experienced in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't teach you about aquaponics,
but I feel like we would be leaving out
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our friends at the Growing with
Fishes podcast if I didn't at least
[SPEAKER_00]: mention aquaponics as a very viable and
sustainable way of fertilizing your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Growing
with Fishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it fascinating, but I do not have
any experience, so I can't teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my podcast about selecting
nutrients and fertilizers for your new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the most important part is that
you are having fun and that you are happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with what comes out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also try to keep in mind the ethics of
whoever you are giving your money to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to shop with people who support our
community and our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I left anything out or if you've got
anything you'd like to add, I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is

[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to reach out if you feel
like I missed something or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something you'd like to add.
