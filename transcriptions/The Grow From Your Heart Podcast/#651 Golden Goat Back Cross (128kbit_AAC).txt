going chatter chatter uh patreon shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to my patreon crew chatter part i'm trying
some new equipment so this episode may be
[SPEAKER_00]: short i don't want to do a long episode
and then find out that the equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what i was hoping it would do
[SPEAKER_00]: without patreon that second camera and
lens would not have happened all right um
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm trying new equipment so this could be
a short episode you guys if i see
[SPEAKER_00]: something blinking if something goes wrong
if i'm not confident we may cut this short
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't want to make too long of an
episode that could fail i do want to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for all of the wonderful comments
excuse me the wonderful comments and the
[SPEAKER_00]: great feedback on the previous episode on
episode 650 you guys left you guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: gals left the best comments a lot of
encouraging comments people said this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is special for some reason uh
people really like that episode it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a lot of views i'm not sure why i
don't know what happened or what i did but
[SPEAKER_00]: uh feels like there was some magic in that
show that people enjoyed thank you i felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like i was having a good time podcasting i
just cut loose and started talking i kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of felt like i was in the pocket again
sometimes podcasting feels like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: work sometimes it feels like it just flows
for that episode i was in the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket i was having a good time uh this is
kind of my zen zone you guys i got
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones on the world could be crumbling
about 15 feet away from me in any
[SPEAKER_00]: direction and i probably wouldn't notice
it unless something loud comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: this microphone and we got some filters
and stuff cutting out a lot of noise the
[SPEAKER_00]: world could crumble this is my zen zone
i'm here helping the people i've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: plan i got some strategically i know what
i'm thinking what i'm doing you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really interrupt this uh so i'm in the
zone when i'm doing the podcast i felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like i got really back in the zone and i
got back in the zone in this episode i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel myself slipping into it i like it um
excuse me for that i did take some dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the uh delicious dabs check out
[SPEAKER_00]: my instagram so you can see these surveys
i've been posting i've been doing uh
[SPEAKER_00]: little surveys do you prefer rosin or
diamonds or diamonds or sauce or rosins or
[SPEAKER_00]: batter uh maybe check out some of those
irie underscore genetics on the instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: um i'm in the pocket and in the zone but i
get rambling when i do that so that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing because i like the flow i like
that zone but also i try to keep the show
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit focused i think you guys like
the balance i try to create anyway thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for all the words of encouragement in
the comments in the last episode you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that was really cool i'm good and stoned
again for another episode hopefully i get
[SPEAKER_00]: as many words of encouragement great
feedback great comments that stuff does
[SPEAKER_00]: mean a lot to a podcaster um i'm way off
topic but hey this is what i'm fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about uh it this doesn't just
happen i don't just like sit down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: table and start going there are two
cameras there's lights there's a bunch i
[SPEAKER_00]: got to charge batteries and plug shit in
there are a lot of cords and plugs you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see all that it's a lot happening so uh it
takes hours out of a day then editing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just planning it i have to manifest
to this show somewhere these ideas have to
[SPEAKER_00]: come somewhere and thank you guys for the
listener generated content but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work that goes into a podcast so
for you to send words of encouragement on
[SPEAKER_00]: youtube and say bro that last episode was
really great i really do appreciate that
[SPEAKER_00]: the patreon contributions definitely fuel
the fire so thank you guys thank you very
[SPEAKER_00]: much i do appreciate it camera two thank
you i love you camera one i love you as
[SPEAKER_00]: well thank you guys all right now let's
move on i do have a message that came uh
[SPEAKER_00]: from my friend billy podunk billy podunk
is a uh prime member of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community he is a big part of the i read
genetics the grow from your heart discord
[SPEAKER_00]: channel there is a link to the discord in
the video description in the show notes
[SPEAKER_00]: right next to that patreon description
there's a discord link uh follow that
[SPEAKER_00]: discord link check out all the stuff we've
got going on on discord billy podunk is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably there hanging out doing something
on discord right now big shout out to that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy big shout out to the whole discord
gang shout out to graybeard for putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: together if you guys ever need anything
please let me know i owe you uh very very
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the word we're gonna just gonna go
with bigly i owe you bigly all right
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great use of camera too i'm using
it already i'm proud of myself all right
[SPEAKER_00]: um i'm obviously fucking stoned and the
question goes that's real quick and simple
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just four questions but they go
like this why a golden goat back cross
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very good question why a golden
goat back cross this gives me a doorway to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a lot i'm gonna kick my feet up on
this part of the table here where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: real comfy i'm gonna pull the mic to my
face we're gonna talk about a golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross why a golden goat back cross
golden goats really popular it's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: popular strain it kills it in a commercial
environment it kills it in a personal grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a lot of recreational benefits when
i smoke golden goat and golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses i get really high from it it's got
a really nice a recreational high it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good concert weed it's good getting shit
done weed i really like golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously because i've bred a lot of shit
to golden goat it's got that really good
[SPEAKER_00]: head buzz to it um it's got good medical
qualities to it i can't i'm not a doctor i
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say that it does this it's these
these statements have not been proven by
[SPEAKER_00]: the fda but i've seen it work well for
migraines and headaches and uh women
[SPEAKER_00]: problems when the women are having their
uh their monthly problems the pain it will
[SPEAKER_00]: help with that pain is what i'm told i
can't speak on experience in that but i've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it work so golden goat grows well as
a grower as a breeder it breeds fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastically with other things too it
gives everything better potency and more
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor so as a breeder it's great for
breeding as a grower it will pay the bills
[SPEAKER_00]: it puts out good weight as a consumer
either medically or recreationally it is
[SPEAKER_00]: very powerful very potent it does what we
need done so it's a very popular strain
[SPEAKER_00]: for several oh and it's also super
photogenic and it smells fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous and it's got great bag appeal
so there's like 14 reasons why that strain
[SPEAKER_00]: is amazing and it should be in a lot of
grows uh so it got very popular here in
[SPEAKER_00]: colorado around 2008 2009 maybe 2010
everybody wanted golden goat it just
[SPEAKER_00]: showed up out of nowhere and it swept the
whole fucking commercial scene because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was killing it somebody got it and when
somebody gets a clone like that uh we
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with our friends we try to be we
want all of our friends to succeed as well
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry if we're in a commercial
grow we try to share so the clone got
[SPEAKER_00]: around all the commercial grows got it
eventually i ended up with it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: another part of the story let's talk about
why uh how it got popular and then let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a couple other things why a bat
cross um so people got the clone it got
[SPEAKER_00]: popular people would come to colorado and
smoke golden goat then they would go home
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to grow weed and now they want to
grow golden goat this is where the bat
[SPEAKER_00]: cross seeds are going to come in the
strain got super popular for several
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons uh people wanted to grow it when
they went back home or maybe in other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries or other places which will lead
to why i made the golden goat as well now
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately golden goat is what is known
was known as a clone only plant i've
[SPEAKER_00]: touched on the phrase clone only before
here's a good opportunity to ramble about
[SPEAKER_00]: clone only a clone only means that it's
clone only the breeder of that plant who
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm going to touch on that in just a
moment mr dank a person named mr dank in
[SPEAKER_00]: topeka kansas made the golden goat mr dank
never released other seeds of the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat cross there was a cross that happened
the seeds that came out were grown a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of those were selected some of them
were tossed i know that one of them we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that one of them became the golden
goat so that's a clone only plant called
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat here is the golden goat
the specific selected plant the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the one that that person chose it is
right here it is golden goat there was
[SPEAKER_00]: another one i think it was named funky
bitch i don't know what happened to that
[SPEAKER_00]: one but it came out of the same batch to
the best of my knowledge i could be wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: if anybody has updates data info please
send that to my email at grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart at hotmail.com if anyone's connected
with mr dank put me in touch i'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: know more of the story um just because
that's part of my job i am kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: historian here um so the golden goat it is
clone only now there were no seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: released there were no other plants
released just that clone which means
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way to make seeds of it it
would be adulterating it the subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: cross will not be pure golden goat it will
be golden goat crossed to a male plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds so this is where the bat cross
idea comes in people want seeds but for
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason i know the there are several
reasons we don't need to touch on those
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons right now there are several
reasons why people do not trust believe or
[SPEAKER_00]: even want to mess with feminized seeds i
offer golden goat and a feminized seed
[SPEAKER_00]: which means i did not adulterate or change
the or alter that plant that golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in any way it is golden goat to pure
golden goat i've talked about feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in a lot of other episodes i took a
golden goat female and another golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: female i treated one with the solution
that solution made the golden goat turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into it made it create pollen sacs which
only contain female pollen to be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: brief about it i put that female pollen on
the other female golden goat we have now
[SPEAKER_00]: made all female all golden goat seeds it's
what they would say uh all og dead stock
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat that's a sneakerhead joke but
some of you will get it with me now some
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't like feminized seeds they
have misinformation or have had bad
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences and that comes from past
breeders back in the day not doing fem
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds correctly not having good morals
we've come a long way since those days so
[SPEAKER_00]: now we know how to make i know how to make
quality feminized seeds i test them i do a
[SPEAKER_00]: good job that's another ramble for another
day so people don't like fems so they want
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat but they don't want
feminized seeds but it's only a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: plant so we've got to do something to make
golden goat seeds the way to do this is
[SPEAKER_00]: bat cross this is where bat cross comes in
that's fucking six minutes of talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the point but welcome to the show
you've never been here before have you um
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway golden goat bat cross why bat cross
because there's no male to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: original people don't want fems we got to
go another route i've got the original
[SPEAKER_00]: female let's make a bat cross it's going
to take some work but we can make some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that come out very close to the
original golden goat and that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a bat cross i've got the female so i
know what i'm looking for i've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: girl i know how she grows i know what the
leaves are shaped like i know how she
[SPEAKER_00]: smells i know how she responds to light
nutrients manipulation of all different
[SPEAKER_00]: types i can bend or twist or pop or pull
leaves off i know how this plant responds
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been working with this plant since
probably i'm going to be generous and say
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008 uh no i'm going to i'm going to be
what's the other word uh modest and say
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010 that's the one i'm looking for i'm
going to be modest and say 2010 generous
[SPEAKER_00]: would be 2008 so i've had this plant for
years we're in 2021 at the time of this
[SPEAKER_00]: recording uh halfway through uh tomorrow
will be the first of the halfway point so
[SPEAKER_00]: um i want to make i want to make fucking
seeds out of this i'm back on track now my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain got lost for a minute to be honest
with you so i've got the female i know
[SPEAKER_00]: what she looks like to make a bat cross i
decided to find a male plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different than the golden goat
completely different than the golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: why because i'm going to pollinate the
golden goat with this male plant and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make seeds now that is going to
be a i used a daybreaker plant daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: was the complete opposite of the golden
goat golden goat kind of had these long
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny leaves uh made tall skinny buds the
daybreaker made like these golf balls on
[SPEAKER_00]: long skinny stems uh i knew that it would
be just a really different cross so i
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed those and i knew that i would be
able to see the golden goat looking
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that came out of the progeny
the offspring of those two being crossed i
[SPEAKER_00]: took the tall skinny plant with the skinny
leaves and the short squatty plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: the big wide leaves and i crossed that and
then i could tell when the seeds grew
[SPEAKER_00]: later i could tell which seeds had the big
giant
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out of that batch of seeds very
distinct growth pattern once you grow her
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of times and you find the
phenotype i'm talking about or if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown the clone only version you will
definitely see that distinct growth
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern she almost does it almost looks
like a twisting she's almost trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more branches more space she wants to
grow more the leaves come out kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird at first when she goes into flower
she looks a little bit strange as she
[SPEAKER_00]: transitions uh you will see that uh where
am i what was i saying uh golden goat um
[SPEAKER_00]: oh it looks just it matches sorry i'm
fucking i got stone and got lost uh it
[SPEAKER_00]: matches it looks it does the same
transition it does the same twisting i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not even gonna edit that i'm gonna leave
that in there i'm telling you guys i got
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stone before this episode and i'm
just in the flow uh so it does the same
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting it does the same thing at the
start of flower it looks just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original female so i got the boy that
looks just like the original female now
[SPEAKER_00]: the step now is to take that male plant
and pollinate that male plant that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like golden goat and pollinate the
original golden goat now this plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: here the male is 50% golden goat and 50%
daybreaker, but from my selection I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose a plant that is probably 75 70 I'm
gonna say 75 to 85 percent maybe 70 to 80
[SPEAKER_00]: percent Golden goat it is a 50 50 cross,
but I chose one that kind of with genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype that leans a little
bit more toward one parent Just like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you got brothers and sisters one looks
more like mom one looks more like dad I
[SPEAKER_00]: found one that looked more like mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one probably 70 75 percent golden
goat 25 percent daybreaker I pollinate the
[SPEAKER_00]: original golden goat now you're going like
75 to 100 percent I think in my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: from what I'm looking at through test
growers through product through consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: grows through my grows these golden goat
back cross ones are producing about 70 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 percent reliable golden goat looking
phenotypes, maybe a little more maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: about 82 percent if I did it again,
I would find so that is a golden goat back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross Let me let me stop right here and
then we'll talk about doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the The gold the daybreaker male
pollinated the golden goat found a male
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks just like golden goat and
repollinated a golden goat again and grew
[SPEAKER_00]: up grew out those seeds which are the
golden goat back cross number one now I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to find a male out of that that looks
just like the golden goat again and Hit
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat with that again,
and that'll be a back cross to what should
[SPEAKER_00]: come out 83 to 89 percent it's a
mathematical equation But it also depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on my selection that I choose the
appropriate males for each back cross
[SPEAKER_00]: because if I don't choose the appropriate
male None of it will go correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to choose the male It's the eye
for breeding the eye for detail the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the plant So then I just
keep doing that I keep finding a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out of the mix of new seeds and
repollinate That original female and if I
[SPEAKER_00]: do my selection properly every time I do
that with each back cross it gets closer
[SPEAKER_00]: and closer and closer to the original
golden goat the first one was Very
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in my selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose the right male that gave me
Building blocks for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really set myself up for success having
80 percent phenotypes that look like the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is Huge success in my opinion the
next time I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be 82 85 87 percent that's a
lot of percentage that's looking like the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal on the second attempt and we're
getting really close to a hundred I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think I don't know that I can get to a
hundred in genetics I think that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to be some uniformity the
trick to getting to a hundred is running
[SPEAKER_00]: larger numbers So that your variables
don't show up as often your mutants and
[SPEAKER_00]: your strange Your your anomalies don't pop
up as randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the keys to getting better
numbers, but I'm gonna get back on track
[SPEAKER_00]: here so the question was why golden goat
back cross because there are Is no male of
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat to make more golden goat
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore it is a clone only it could
be feminized But a lot of people are not
[SPEAKER_00]: into the feminized seeds because of old
breeding techniques myths rumors
[SPEAKER_00]: misconceptions around feminized seeds and
Back cross because that's the only way to
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds out of it How to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I explained that Cross it with
something adulterated is the word there
[SPEAKER_00]: then kind of wash out what you've
adulterated it with you've got to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: that part out if you do your Selection
properly it only takes a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to my buddy
Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call him f1 Pete Pl grow Pete One bad
motherfucker Pete Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: A great person in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're a good friend, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my friend I'm not gonna get all
gushy here on the show But Pete's my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and I learned a lot from Pete Pete
is very intelligent Pete is
[SPEAKER_00]: forward-thinking Pete is Pete's fucking
smarter than me to be quite frank and Pete
[SPEAKER_00]: teaches me a lot and I'm going to go ahead
and Give Pete credit for what I'm about to
[SPEAKER_00]: say I've been labeling the cannabis
community has been labeling back crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: as a BX We say BX 1 BX 2 it sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rolls off the tongue nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good on a package Pete's right
when he says that back cross should be
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a back cross But the reason I
always thought BX look good is because you
[SPEAKER_00]: do like strain a X strain to like you're
doing fucking algebra here It's this one
[SPEAKER_00]: times this one and I don't like to say
times I say to or crossed or something I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know what I say naturally
anymore I say so many things but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like X you got the X in there So
it's like back crossed because we would
[SPEAKER_00]: always say like a rise cross to strawberry
fields or something or Ninja Turtles cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to GI Joe and so Back cross crosses in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just we were saying back cross,
but Pete's right, bro BC back cross BC one
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross one BC to back cross to Don't
get misled by labeling don't get too
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up by labeling but also those
labels Are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're the one making the labels get
caught up in them and get them correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: please Shout out to my buddy Pete Shout
out to Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, um There are more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have I been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I'm going to quit while
I'm ahead because there are let's tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: story of golden goat is the next question
on here and then we'll cover the next two
[SPEAKER_00]: questions in the next episode after we do
some camera adjustments and we'll do two
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes today we'll record to see if we
can get this shit, correct, um What is the
[SPEAKER_00]: story of golden goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tried to wet my lips on it I think
I licked the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm human you guys I do a lot of weird
shit, especially on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh Story golden goat so golden goat to
the best of my knowledge was created on
[SPEAKER_00]: Accident by a guy known as mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank who was in Topeka, Kansas It was an
island sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows Hawaiian sweet skunk and Romulan
plant Okay, the three ingredients are
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian sweet skunk island sativa and
Romulan my brain is cock blocking me on
[SPEAKER_00]: which order that Went in one of those
plants accidentally pollinated the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian sweet sweet skunk knows Hawaiian
sativa to Romulan was pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Googler right here To the
Hawaiian sativa to Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a Hawaiian sativa to Romulan
plant was the male Hawaiian sativa cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a Romulan boy pollinated Hawaiian
sativa that became a plant then that
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally Accidentally pollinated an
island sweet skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an accidental plant Accidental
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank had an accidental pollination in his
garden then that made the golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds were allowed to continue
allowed to pollinate allowed to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to Maturate mature rise to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever dude, they were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hardened up bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those seeds were taken out of the
plant They were harvested and mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank apparently grew them one of the seeds
He grew became the golden goat that golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat passed the fucking standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became popular That's the story of
where the golden goat came from The reason
[SPEAKER_00]: it was named golden goat is because in
Topeka, Kansas there is a recycling center
[SPEAKER_00]: that recycles soda cans and mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank thought that the Golden goat plant
smelled like the sticky sweet syrupy
[SPEAKER_00]: smells of the Golden goat recycling center
in the middle of the summer in Topeka,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas and Topeka It is like hot and
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in Lawrence for a little while we
used to go to Topeka to cause trouble It
[SPEAKER_00]: was gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of sticky and funky And I'm
sure that if there was a recycling center
[SPEAKER_00]: with sticky syrup in the air You would
smell it for a while and it probably smell
[SPEAKER_00]: quite delicious in that hot Sun that
sticky sweet soda flavor I could smell it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smell the golden goat just
permeating my brain right now So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the name came from is Accidentally
made by mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank in Topeka, Kansas who was named
because of the golden goat recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: center Now here's something I really want
to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um This plant was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically like if you really want To
find a name for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't a breeding project to the best
of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't done on purpose This would be
bag seed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what this is the kind of seed if
this breeder didn't realize there were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in there He cut down his crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He dried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cured it He put it out to market like a
lot of people do and you found the bag or
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed in one of your buds You put it
you put in your grinder you give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: twist and you feel that little what is
that and you open it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fucking couple of seeds in there
That would be considered bag seed if you
[SPEAKER_00]: had grown this and you found this plant
And you had the bright idea to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat also You would have been
growing bag seed and you would have found
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the champion fucking plants one of
the best plants on the planet In my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion it breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've read a lot of shit to it I'm
going to continue to breed a lot of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to it But the person that would have found
this would have called it bag seed luckily
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder pulled it out of the plant or
his own bag and it got called something
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and it got spread out as a clone only
it was bag seed though, technically,
[SPEAKER_00]: so my point is Don't judge your bag seed
by the cover if the herb you got your seed
[SPEAKER_00]: from was good Or even if the herb you got
your bag seed from was mediocre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have high high quality herb
Golden goat was an accident in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla glue was probably an accident I
think cookies was probably an accident the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem line all of the chem dog stuff that
we love we know the chem 91 chem sister
[SPEAKER_00]: chem D chem for all Of the chem dog
crosses all of the chem dog stuff not the
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses but the chem dog the original 13
seeds minus the males Came from what would
[SPEAKER_00]: be known as bag seed and chem dog is one
of the best Oh that camera over there just
[SPEAKER_00]: gave up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see oh, I didn't put on the auto
temp shut off I knew I messed something
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I didn't rely on that camera Um,
so we got to switch the auto the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna write that down heat on the
other one When that one hits 30 minutes or
[SPEAKER_00]: gets too hot it shuts the fuck off So
where the shit was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Topeka, Kansas Bag seed clone only so a
lot of those strains were clone only the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog stuff all of the chem dog stuff
Was clone only a lot of the popular stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: now or a lot of the chem dog stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I got distracted was from a bag
seed There were 13 seeds that chem dog got
[SPEAKER_00]: he grew a lot of them He found a lot of
gems and bag seed you guys Then a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those were bred to and became a lot of the
popular strains that we were working with
[SPEAKER_00]: now a lot of the stinky stinky That's
stinky and skunky shit was from the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog lineage and that is bag seed so my
point is One of my one of my fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: points today is don't misjudge your bag
seed You could have amazing shit in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bag or you could have complete trash The
key is that you grow it out you pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention You don't give it out to
somebody else and you know that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with fireworks You could have
something that's gonna blow up at week
[SPEAKER_00]: nine to be fully herms I could be a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a full fucking mutant it might
not even be worth putting in your flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room you might discover that early in veg
or late in veg or Or just maybe or you
[SPEAKER_00]: could be growing the next golden goat the
next chem dog You may have just created or
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered the next Girl Scout gorilla
goat cookie chem Whatever magic you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want That is your brand new
thing that you just discovered us when you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it just like nuts a bag seed
that I found here and I called it this and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing with it And growing it
if you want to put clones of it out you
[SPEAKER_00]: can that is it's kind of it's your new
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yep, that is the quick version of the
golden goat story and that led me into
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about bag seed and clone only once
again clone only it's clone only because
[SPEAKER_00]: there was never a Male of that golden goat
put out so nobody got to breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no seeds put out So nobody got
to breed more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made bat crosses of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made fem seeds of it Big shout out to my
buddy We're gonna call him pineapple
[SPEAKER_00]: express.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he listens to the show I
don't know if he's still around town

married and had kids and kind of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: how people fall off the face of the earth
He did one of those moves but big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my buddy pineapple express.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where that clone came from That's
how I got the golden goat.

I ended up with it from my friend Paco
[SPEAKER_00]: Lolo pineapple express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the dudes from Hawaiian from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a cliche nickname All right,
