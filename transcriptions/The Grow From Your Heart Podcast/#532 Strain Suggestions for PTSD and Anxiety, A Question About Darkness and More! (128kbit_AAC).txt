thank you what i can while i can man man
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing a lot we uh the episode where
we interviewed you we i learned about you
[SPEAKER_00]: i learned stuff i didn't even know so i'm
sure the listeners are sitting there going
[SPEAKER_00]: wow this guy does a lot of shit and they
learned a lot about you so we missed a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff in that one too i was thinking
about it last night and this morning well
[SPEAKER_00]: what'd you miss let's fucking jump into it
if you feel like it um there's just a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the in-betweens like there was a whole
long period where i helped people design
[SPEAKER_01]: and build grow rooms in their houses there
was yeah when that dispensary closed down
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where we went crazy we learned how
to build grows for people we did private
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting we were helping with all kinds
of shit then and that's where i got really
[SPEAKER_00]: good at building private grows private
grows driving plants around the state we
[SPEAKER_00]: called it genetic acquisition was the
technical words we used we'll help you
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire genetics it means i'll drive a
tray of clones up to you
[SPEAKER_01]: um some of those really early meetings
where it was like driving to fort collins
[SPEAKER_01]: with three people in a car so that
everybody could pay 300 for the 1500
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar lawyer fee um to hear someone to
break down amendment 20 for a whole room
[SPEAKER_01]: full of people the wild west days were
nutty man yeah i don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: realized how long the podcast we did
together was so i'm glad you you skipped a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit because it got long it's
another there's nothing wrong with it but
[SPEAKER_00]: that was one of our longest shows and it's
really good so don't have any issues but
[SPEAKER_01]: it was okay anything we've done like since
the med was created oh the yeah since
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gotten the marijuana enforcement
division our game has completely changed
[SPEAKER_00]: both of us had to shift gears and relearn
everything so yeah uh man if you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: delving into that we could talk about that
right now or if you'd like we could do the
[SPEAKER_01]: white mic interview part two it's a three
hour show all right i'm gonna write down
[SPEAKER_00]: as we talked about i'm gonna write down
white mic part two on one of my notes here
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're gonna do that in the future
but i just gotta scroll it down hit us up
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media let us know you want it
it's gonna happen dude because i wrote a
[SPEAKER_00]: note and when i write notes it generally
happens generally if i don't write a note
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't happen but you know it's official
it's in the binder now it is it is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: three ring binder it's in the little
magical notebook which uh spawns all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these podcasts it is the podcast friendly
book uh that's a fucking fish joke and i
[SPEAKER_00]: love you if you got it mike i'm gonna take
a quick dab because i've noticed that i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fast and you're fucking slow you
want me to fail that's a dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition well talk about something but
don't get too crazy what's on your mind
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy how much digging the zoom video uh
do zoom video shows man i uh it's time we
[SPEAKER_01]: took this step we waited too long yeah um
weird little silver lining of the pandemic
[SPEAKER_00]: the next step bro is to convince you to do
live videos with me we need to make a time
[SPEAKER_00]: a spot once a week or once every other
week where we could do this live and have
[SPEAKER_00]: a chat going we can get a youtube chat
watching us and they can participate it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be late um but i bet we can do it
there's no reason we couldn't be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that right now now here's something that
crosses my mind is it's got to be late
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've got to make time for the
family now if patreon we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sending you a paycheck in a way then would
the wife be a little more inclined to say
[SPEAKER_00]: oh you mean from seven o'clock to eight o
'clock or eight o'clock to nine o'clock
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to go play with your stoner
friends it would be a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_01]: that would that's for sure that's for sure
all right well we we're gonna have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can do to boost up that patreon
for you bro these late night bunker
[SPEAKER_01]: sessions might be the the thing for a
minute these are a good time we could
[SPEAKER_00]: always go live with these when you're
comfortable but i know you're i know i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking away slowly in my house right now
like a two-year-old and a four-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a ridiculous amount of noise yeah
it's probably the equivalent of me and a
[SPEAKER_00]: drum set i'm gonna hit this dab so now is
when i really need you to talk so go for
[SPEAKER_00]: it just give me you know 40 seconds all
right listen narrate my dad if you'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: watch this hippie get all red faced and
cloudy definitely check out our patreons
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're interested in supporting the
show if you've got questions you can hit
[SPEAKER_01]: us up on social media my twitter is at
nemo punk 15 facebook you can find me at
[SPEAKER_01]: pablo for sensible cannabis laws jeff will
give you all of his social media handles
[SPEAKER_01]: when he comes down from that dab writes
about now yeah uh you can find me on
[SPEAKER_00]: twitter at gf yh podcast or my personal
wow that was gross my personal is at rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: jeff 420 i like the instagram i re
underscore genetics on instagram is where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're finding a lot of my cool cannabis
photography i was gonna ask uh is the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience interested in me using a lapel
mic would that be better than this stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: mic here in front of my face do you want
that lapel mic so that when i'm dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit it's not so awkward is that worth
the investment that's what i'll use
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon money on if you guys vote that i
should do that at the next patreon project
[SPEAKER_00]: i think so yeah just well yeah because
then you don't get off mic so much because
[SPEAKER_00]: when you move it moves with you it's stuck
to your shirt yeah it was easier before my
[SPEAKER_01]: old my chair at your place doesn't have
wheels this wouldn't reclines and has
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels dude it's it's two things all over
the place yep yeah and i just want to if i
[SPEAKER_00]: put it here uh then i could move this out
of the way and i could have my hands more
[SPEAKER_00]: available i could use paper better uh just
free up some space and you can see my
[SPEAKER_00]: stylish shirt this is an ivory army shirt
you can't even fucking tell bro it just
[SPEAKER_00]: says because you got the big blocking in
the middle right it's all right podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: world i am high as giraffe pussy after
that dad thank you for hanging out with us
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few minutes i know we've been
rambling for several minutes we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten to the what do they say the meat
and potatoes of the podcast you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: crack this sucker open and get to the main
topic of the show tonight mike i like to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate podcasts based on listener
generated requests that means emails you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that's what i'm saying when you send
me an email and you ask a question i know
[SPEAKER_00]: that i'm helping you because if somebody
has that question if one person asked uh
[SPEAKER_00]: the the numbers say probably a lot of
people wondered and only one person took
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to send the question so we're
going to answer a listener generated
[SPEAKER_00]: emails in this episode if you've got a
grow uh cultivation a cannabis culture any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of question that you think i can
answer on the show my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart at hotmail.com i
would love to hear from you the first
[SPEAKER_00]: email on today's episode well i took that
dab in my fucking i can't even read but i
[SPEAKER_00]: still i'm talking i'm doing it wow where
have we been for the past 30 seconds do
[SPEAKER_01]: you need another minute before you have to
read from a page this is the funnest part
[SPEAKER_00]: dude is trying to read from the page when
i can't even keep my fucking eyes open all
[SPEAKER_00]: right here we go it says use my name if
you want people call me wags what up wags
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great email it says
thank you for everything you do you are
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated mike we're appreciated bro
thank us our friend here is in prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: land so variety is not an option which
means they can't get strains like we can
[SPEAKER_00]: we are spoiled i went to the dispensary
today and i chose from about 10 different
[SPEAKER_00]: things uh we're spoiled here it says i'm
at the mercy of whatever my guy can get
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this i have decided to grow my
own um you're in prohibition land be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful i've read a couple of books and
i've listened to a ton of podcasts you are
[SPEAKER_00]: off to a great start most people buy seeds
and then you're a mile ahead of most
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners yeah yeah they put the cart
before way before the horse so it says
[SPEAKER_00]: i've read books and listened to podcasts
your podcast has by far been my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you i don't think it's a competition
but i love hearing that you appreciate my
[SPEAKER_00]: work i do appreciate that it says i give
you you give a lot of knowledge in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that almost anyone can understand that is
my goal i understand that some people
[SPEAKER_00]: learn i don't know the technical terms for
it but i know that when i went to school i
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to learn the way the teacher
was teaching me but i had a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: teachers who would say hey this is how it
works and i would understand and care so i
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you got to hit people at
different angles to teach them i've also
[SPEAKER_00]: got add and i get fucking bored so i've
got to entertain myself here to entertain
[SPEAKER_00]: you so i make it fun so that i don't get
bored and then my stoner friends like yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fun and we can all learn together
like i think a little bit of fun is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: reward for your brain it's like a cookie
you get a bunch of knowledge and knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a joke and you're like oh i can
learn more a knowledge a knowledge and a
[SPEAKER_00]: joke and it just keeps your brain fresh
i'm rambling because of that dab but i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: glad that you understand or that you
appreciate that i'm trying to teach uh
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different ways it says maybe you
should write a book uh mike's gonna write
[SPEAKER_00]: a book i thought about writing a book and
that's what spawned the podcast i was at
[SPEAKER_00]: maddie and spence's house and a bunch of
people kept asking grow questions but
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's like five questions the same
questions and like write a book and i was
[SPEAKER_00]: like no instead of a book let's do a
podcast i'll just put a mic in front of my
[SPEAKER_00]: face and say all the same shit that i've
said before and then we'll just record it
[SPEAKER_00]: and when people say hey how do you dry and
cure your plants i'll go listen to episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 326 then i don't have to burn my throat
out saying it again and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to that in the car and we can have
a conversation now as friends i've made
[SPEAKER_00]: things better so i'm gonna get back into
the email because this will take 45
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes if i keep doing it like this it
says while the purpose of this message is
[SPEAKER_00]: just to say thanks and let you know that
you're doing a great job i also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick question well thank you for reaching
out and telling us we're doing a great job
[SPEAKER_00]: that means a lot to us we ask for patreon
contributions but the people that just
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out and say good job that means as
much to me as a patreon contribution like
[SPEAKER_00]: it recharges me and fucking i'm helping
you and that means a lot to me like money
[SPEAKER_00]: is awesome but knowing that i'm helping
that was the goal of the podcast so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking awesome thank you now there is a
question my main goal of growing is for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal purposes is there a strain which
you can recommend for ptsd depression and
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety any information is appreciated
thanks again for everything keep up the
[SPEAKER_00]: good work you rock from your friend wags
wags i've got a lot of great suggestions i
[SPEAKER_00]: think mike can chime in with a lot of
great options but before we get there i
[SPEAKER_00]: should say that many of the things we're
going to recommend are based on your body
[SPEAKER_00]: your body chemistry your physical
condition your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: your blood pressure your crystals your
blood pressure your blood's start to
accumulate So you can read us on my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know any tip for me for your heart
which is the word that it I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to talk to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab of Lemon Jeffery and I won't
shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it fixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that like, if you got a record
player in your brain, I got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a skip a couple of spots on my record.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get past it, the song will
keep playing, but it's going to skip a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, everyone's got a CD or a
burnt CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got off a Napster or LimeWire in the
fucking nineties that one song,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been one week since you looked at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that every time in that
fucking song, it's going to skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain has those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Limonene and the Lemon Jeffery,
I feel like makes it wipes the macaroni
[SPEAKER_00]: off my dirty CD and it makes my record
player spin smooth and I can function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first strain I'd recommend would be
the Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one will be Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about those orange and lemon
terpene strains really work well for
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, depression, and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are smiley strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeffery has Limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the terpene right now off
the top of my head in Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the orange terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells just like fucking oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would recommend a Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jilly Bean is not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from Miss Jill Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jilly Bean has that orange candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like wreck you when you smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get like, I'm so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get like, oh, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, when you're the
first time you take Molly or the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time you take acid, you want to tell
everybody that you're tripping and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're high and that it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, I'm tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just smiling about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate Molly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's like the stone you get from
things like Jilly Bean and Lemon Jeffery
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a smiley like, hey, look how
smiley I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, you want to go to the mall and
for no reason just go to the mall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're just getting a good mood and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it does to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those sound like, and those are
mostly sativa heavy dominant types of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's going to agree with me when I say
that those may give you a full on fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: panic attack, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just, it really depends on you
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you're in prohibition land
wags, it's going to really depend on what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got available to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfortunately just going to be a
lot of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sounds like they're interested
in purchasing some seeds from a local seed
[SPEAKER_00]: or from an online seed bank and giving it
a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing I would recommend,
and would you agree with this,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, would you recommend that also they
may want to try some CBD because CBD will
[SPEAKER_00]: treat for all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try everything you need your hands
on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they need to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that I think you get yourself a
notebook and take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick, if you can get, you can get a CBD
tincture delivered to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order CBD from, find a reputable
CBD source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I don't want to say any of them,
because if I say a company, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get 50 fucking emails saying fuck that
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research and find a CBD company.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the podcasts you listen to do a CBD
ad at the start of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to a popular podcast,
they've all got a CBD ad now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that Joey D, get one from Joey
Diaz or get the one that fucking Brennan
[SPEAKER_00]: Schaub uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like those people and I trust them
and they probably advertise good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey uses the one that he advertises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and so does Brennan Schaub uses it on
a son who's got a seizure condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have valid reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would trust something they advertise,
but get a good CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order it online, wherever you are,
it'll come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double up on whatever they fucking say to
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is not going to have any adverse
reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double up on your smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will go wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm learning not being.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a recent study out on CBD showing
if you take, and it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: The milligrams, but it was a couple
hundred a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 50 milligrams per kilogram or
some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a lot, but if you get a
thousand milligram bottle and try to pound
[SPEAKER_01]: half of it, like you might tweak your
liver a little bit, like you would say on
[SPEAKER_01]: a heavy night of drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to tell you to take that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to end up with a little
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you it's expensive, but take some
drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're going to want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your homework first before you start
taking a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but take some of it, take what it
says, maybe a little bit more and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps, but don't smoke any herb that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that shit and see if it helps you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we know if CBD helps because it's
going to come on better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to work better in the
drop form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles work more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not more quickly, but more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking, they come on,
you notice them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try the CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't do what you need to do,
let's go the opposite direction and go
[SPEAKER_00]: with one of these, uh, THC dominant kind
of sativa kind of style plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see if that sort of stuff works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you're going to have to
grow those because you can't just buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: flower anywhere unless you've got some
funding and you can take a trip out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and you can go hit a dispensary
and you can just go buy a bunch of grams
[SPEAKER_00]: at different shops and go shop around and
find different things and take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from those notes, you can dial it
in and kind of see what's working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to find seeds or plants that
work similar similarly to those strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a lot of work unless you can
get out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, if you're looking to grow
it at home, you're going to have like one
[SPEAKER_01]: good journal entry every 120 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with growing it out and figuring out
if it works or not, and then trying the
[SPEAKER_01]: next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe find, I don't know how big of a
grow space you're going to do or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a small space, you can fit
several plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get feminized seeds, maybe you've
got a five by five space under two cannons
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe a 600 watt HPS light,
or maybe just a, another kind of LED that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just spitting out things that would
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that into five by five, maybe do nine
feminized seeds and do by three packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe get a lemon Jeffrey,
get something that's CBD dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like an ACDC or what's the one I'm
thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a cool name, Harlequin or
Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of those are CBD rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find something that is CBD rich
online from the same seed bank that will
[SPEAKER_00]: carry my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to wherever you're going to
find mine, seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find the fucking CBD seeds there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some feminized CBD seeds,
get some feminized, iri genetic seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then get something else that is right
in the middle of that, maybe an indica
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant or just a fucking a 50 50 hybrid
or something else to get your attention
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow three of three feminized,
three seeds each of three feminized and
[SPEAKER_00]: see which one of those makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've still got half a pack of
FEM seeds left of each one to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you find a keeper, you can either
order more seeds of that, or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking grow the other ones, or maybe I
don't know if you're able to keep a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation, but if you've
only got the one room, that's three seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: of three different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get nine plants to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it doesn't perfectly work for
your condition, you got some weed to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe maybe combinations of two of
them or three of them or this one and this
[SPEAKER_00]: one or this one and this one or these
three together, maybe something out of all
[SPEAKER_00]: nine of those will really make it happen
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wish we could be like,
just go pick up some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: blue moon at the liquor store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, especially in Prohibitionland,
it's a lot more difficult, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful part is those once he does
find the plant and don't be discouraged if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't find the plant on the first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some of us spend years doing a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do find that one,
it's like finding your soulmate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like watch, watch when I say grateful dog,
watch Mike's face, like see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me smile because in
Prohibitionland, there's no plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so depending on where you live,
the plant count, I mean, the cops might
[SPEAKER_01]: consider like one to 29 plants the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got a little more wiggle
room than we do here because of dumber
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: States just do minimal whiting and
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to get you noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up the laws in your area so you know
what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a lawyer on retainer and have
some money set aside because shit could go
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong and just always set aside bail money
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your lawyer's got a duffel bag
full of funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I advertise my own brand,
but I breed things that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy dabbing, high limonene and
citrusy flavored stuff because I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury that gives me the conditions
which you were describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I like similar, but different
shit when it comes to smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that love whey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like purple weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple weed just never works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do anything good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that purple flavor turnt isn't for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just all about our body,
our body chemistry, what works for us and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a few recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, go for something limonene,
something orangey, something CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: something indica, maybe a 50-50 hybrid,
deadhead OG right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try something like that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get some femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the femini seeds so that you don't
have to cull the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it easy for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you can find how to take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taught how to take clones on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones of your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they go into flower, you got to
take clones, but keep your favorites and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wags, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I are here to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got more
questions, the email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, it looks like you're going to say
something important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cut you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: This segue on what's on deck, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to see if they want their
names said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an illegal grow owner and I grow my
own medicine, but they don't say if I
[SPEAKER_00]: could say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it doesn't matter what their name
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to call him Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hello, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the killer podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learnt with a T, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learnt so much from you and your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this one especially starts with white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a shout out in this message,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And learnt makes me think of our friend,
John.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a word that he used to say,
I learnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what is your thought on extended
darkness just before harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I finished a few crops and I've given them
anywhere from 24 to 48 hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: just before I chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't honestly say I've noticed any
major boost in trichome production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's enough time for
trichomes to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, but they would just be little.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just spent 60 days producing
trichomes basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in flower for 60, 63,
70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long it's taken to get our
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trichome farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vegetation there, but we are
farming trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to see much trichome
production in two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some density in the flower,
possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some color changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is just starting to finish
itself on the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If trichomes did pop up on the last 48
hours, they're not going to be ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to be trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been letting those, looking with a
scope for fucking two weeks going,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they ripe yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they amber yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pop them up at the last 48 hours,
they're not amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want those anyway if that
were a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'm sure of is a very
healthy pineapple express plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to wilt and go very limp after
24 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made wet trimming a real pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost seemed saturated, although I
hadn't watered it at least four days prior
[SPEAKER_00]: to turning the light off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pineapple chunk plant I had in the same
tent stayed firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And healthy and was easy trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, I will refrain from
giving them extended darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to know your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it sounds like you kind of answered
your own question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one plant got pissed off at you for
being in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking leaves went droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just stopped eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the juice that was in the
plant, it couldn't put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I can't transfer it and
respirate this water, this air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to try to spit it out
through the bottom and actually probably
[SPEAKER_00]: re-moisten the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's accurate,
but I think that that could be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have just re-moistened the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it would have all just stayed right
there in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that moisture would have been there in
the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you went to cut it, it would
have just been a sticky wet mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do the 48 hours or the
24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is terpenes develop in the
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you turn off the lights before
harvest and let those terps develop,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it that natural night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're unable to harvest right as
the lights would normally come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes, like right now,
Mike and I are recording at midnight
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's got kids and I've got a crazy
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a perfect time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would have left the lights off all
day just because it's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have just left them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have gone 24 full hours without
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that would fuck them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 48 is when you start pushing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpenes develop in that darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool, the dark, you get more terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you cut it in the dark time,
you're going to get more aroma and more
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor because that bright grow light kind
of volatizes some of your terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant's putting them off more at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get more terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a little more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant starts to kind of dry and cure
itself on the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, bro, if you're going to
do that, if you're going to go 24 or 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, chop off all those big fan leaves
before you get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of do a pre-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a cough thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the fuck that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-harvest family shave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a pre-harvest little manicure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just saves all that leaf
material in the fucking final trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all caught up around the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I got that crap out of my
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can continue freely now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think you answered your own
question, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do that again because it
didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it, do cut those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you're going to do in the grow
room, have a strategy for why are you
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear about it on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they give you a reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your bro say to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did some guy that grew weed a thousand
years ago tell you to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you trying to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it just trichome production?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that this is rumored to
really do that I've never been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: play with enough to know if it works or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during the day, the bud loosens up a
little bit and at night it tightens back
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you end up harvesting in theory
with the nugs as tight as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a dark period first, but very
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always just made droopy leaves in a
fucking nightmare trim when I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now we've got two testimonies,
droopy leaves and a fucking nightmare
[SPEAKER_00]: mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut those leaves off if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have gone a couple of days
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I cut those off a few days
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks Rasta Jeff and keep up all
the great work you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They signed it with their full name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, PS, I'm in a legal grow zone
and I grow my own medicine, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions,
please send them to me because I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's going on in your grow and I'd
like to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was rereading the message,
making sure I got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink a bunch of water and it's got my
body going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, we've got one more email
that I would like to cover in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you just gave me that go for
it face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just signed up for Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says although at a small monthly level,
bro, don't worry any contributions,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in these COVID times,
people are doing weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are out of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you threw me any sort of
a contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not look to see what the amount was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was the maximum or the minimum tier
available, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys can't contribute to
Patreon, some people act like they
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't listen or whatever because they
ask for Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, listen, do your best in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you can pay me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go grow really good cannabis or tell
somebody else about the show if you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I wish I could give more,
but my wife and I, my wife, my wife and I
[SPEAKER_00]: live on a fixed income.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't require a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to get a shout out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having you read my email on episode 500
was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you want to shout me out,
please use used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've said your name quite a few times on
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the continued support,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to finally have you as a
Patreon contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that you and your wife
are on a fixed income.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it ever comes a time you have to revoke
your Patreon contribution, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me an email a few days ago
saying, bro, I had to stop being a Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's COVID times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take care of your family yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I love you and thank you for all
of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the message though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I just put a golden goat into
flower and it is an amazing plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you don't mind, I'd like to
share some photos and he shared photos
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and they look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I went back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I went back and listened to your
golden goat podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took your, it can take anything too
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause and clear my
throat real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the video, that's going to look fucking
real funky, but it says, so in the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: I did about golden goat, I basically said
that plant can take anything you fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: throw at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets macronutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can feed her real heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can twist her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pop her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bend her the fuck over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spank her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can defoliate her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can light that bitch on fire and it
will just keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he took that to heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I grow in super soil and I put it
in almost 100% super soil and train the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of it with a combination of super
cropping, bondage and de-leafing and light
[SPEAKER_00]: de-leafing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nearly doubled in size in just a
few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should give yourself a shout out
that golden goat did a good job for our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our work together, bro, I told you how
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go in your grow room and do any
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, thank you for the great
info and the entertaining content signed
[SPEAKER_00]: from your friend used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, you're still cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask me, you're in there growing,
I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're emailing a show and you're also
contributing to a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're growing golden goat,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking never used to still is
cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put yourself on the cool team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those rock stars, they're just
people, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they walked out on stage one day and
they go, watch this, bro, watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went and acted like a dickhead
for 40 minutes in front of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: people fell for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're rock stars and they just
continue it every night now since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it takes to be a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking decide, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a sock in your jeans and rock.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, this is a good time to start
wrapping up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously stoned and getting weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give you an opportunity at the
end of the show here to say anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be on your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like a Mike's moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been kind of quiet this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's got nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be kind to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably going to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important message we could give
is be kind to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really think I mean, I've been
trying to duck away from the social media
[SPEAKER_01]: minute today, which is a little bit
unusual for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think the world would be a
better place for everybody to fucking hit
[SPEAKER_01]: their bowl and just relax a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the social media away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your phone away for just a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out with the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe call somebody instead of just
scrolling around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be good to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call your mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat has told me that we're done
podcasting, so it is time to wrap up the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.

me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because life ain't nothing but a good
brew.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good mixed tea can put you in the right
mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one goes out to my man, the brew
merchant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me to a feast for which I've been
searching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two sealed copies of expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like Tom Boo with gaps and mansions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The logo I score is the face of the
monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Union made, fed, damaged, quality is on
Jones.

item.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull a rider round town on my low rider
bicycle.
Do you know what you're telling me to do?
I live my own life.
So many
[SPEAKER_04]: wacky MCs, you get the TV Bozak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ain't even gonna call out your names
because you're so wack.
[SPEAKER_04]: For one big oaf who's bigger than plastic,
a dictionary definition of the word
[SPEAKER_04]: spastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't ever start us up,
you couldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect rhymes to me is like pop of the
spinach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bad ass, move your bad ass cause
you're wax on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dancing around like you think you're Janet
Jackson.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can walk on me to get some ground
to walk on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull a rug out from under your ass as I
talk on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an MC, I'm the fever in the DJ booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: With your headphones, scrap your rock and
rewind pause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to figure out what you can do to go
for yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like a pencil to the paper,
I got more to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: One after another, you could all get some.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you better take your time and meditate
on your rhyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause your shit will be stinking when I go
for mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's right y'all, don't get uptight
y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You change your shit because you're biting
what I write y'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's wrong y'all, over the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't cut no mustard when you're
frontin' it on, it on, it on, it on,
it on, it on.
It on, it on, it on, it on, it on,
it on, it on, it on, it on, it on,
it on, it on, it on, it on, it on,
