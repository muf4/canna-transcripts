[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff you bad motherfucker I
like it when it starts like that It says I
[SPEAKER_00]: love the show the grow from your heart
podcast and the dude grows show keep me
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and entertained on my two-hour
drive to and from work Dude, that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: long drive you drive in two hours each
direction big respect That's some
[SPEAKER_00]: dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of hours in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on It says I'm a new grower on
my second season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ordered my first batch of irie
genetics Congratulations, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions about those
genetics when you're growing them I do
[SPEAKER_00]: expect more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer all of those questions It
does say I wanted to get some arise to
[SPEAKER_00]: search for a mother plant and a father
plant to breed with however Arise was
[SPEAKER_00]: unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked up morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great cross to pick up
unfortunately The arise sells well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess fortunately for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for you the arise sells out
quite quickly That strain has been very
[SPEAKER_00]: well advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has gotten very popular That one is all
over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does sell out quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot make enough of that I've made f2s
I'm working on the f3s, which I will
[SPEAKER_00]: release eventually, but I cannot keep the
arise in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you understand that I'm glad
you went with the morning dew That is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great backup plan a good decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I'll be doing a phenol
hunt and the winner will be Breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: jinx proofs nine pound hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be an amazing cross I'm
already running strain idea name strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name ideas through my head The first thing
that happened was like morning dew nine
[SPEAKER_00]: pound hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start naming this shit for some
reason That's the first thing my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to go to it's gonna be an amazing
cross Jinx proof is a great breeder great,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some I stand behind my morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's gonna be an amazing cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that goes well for you I cannot
wait to get a few of those seeds to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: out and see What you did wink wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's keep going with the message
it says Thank you for everything you do
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the knowledge you drop on us,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome I feel like I would
explode if I didn't share this knowledge I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I was given this gift of like
gift of gab and the ability to just retain
[SPEAKER_00]: and Regurgitate information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is my duty and my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like my service It's what I was
put here to do if I didn't do it something
[SPEAKER_00]: would go wrong like cosmically karmically
I may just spontaneously Combust or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I'm supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, but I appreciate that It
says my goal is to practice breeding to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a medicine that works for my
wife's chronic pain and nausea which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: result from an infection of a flesh-eating
bacteria he did put the The damn Greek
[SPEAKER_00]: words for the flesh-eating bacteria here,
but I'm not even gonna try to stumble
[SPEAKER_00]: through those words It goes on to say oh
also big respect for stepping up to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: create medicine for your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true Love right there creating
Medicine for one person that you love
[SPEAKER_00]: dearly to treat them because you're
watching them suffer You want the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of both of your lives to be better big
respect for taking initiative?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for having that passion that that is
often what inspires a breeder something
[SPEAKER_00]: like this is what inspires a Cannabis
grower a breeder an advocate an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what gets people on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you big respect it says Third and
I hope your wife is okay also and if I can
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything, let me know It says 13
surgeries later.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lives a somewhat normal life But the
pain and nausea keep her relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: opiates and other scary Pharmaceuticals
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 13 surgeries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't imagine that surgeries make me
Just small stuff like I had a tooth pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had a fucking panic attack all day
for that So surgeries and things are not
[SPEAKER_00]: up my alley She your wife is a soldier
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect to her She is definitely in
the iry army and something weird if I take
[SPEAKER_00]: pills I get nauseous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like like even Ibuprofen or
Vicodin or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take pills They make me want to
throw up So it's amazing how our bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: are so different that your wife is using
these things to combat the nausea And
[SPEAKER_00]: those things make me throw up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how our bodies work There is
a point to this it says I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a strain that helps reduce the amount
of pharmacol Pharmaceuticals needed daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's such a beautiful thing I had
the honor and the privilege of being a
[SPEAKER_00]: major part in the first dispensary here in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the first I was like the
first budtender to have a reputation to be
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I'm just saying I was one of the
first budtenders to develop a Budtender
[SPEAKER_00]: client budtender patient relationship with
my clientele here in this area I was very
[SPEAKER_00]: blessed to be in an area that we had
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We established a dispensary I got to meet
sick people I got to see what it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: when somebody would come in some of my
favorites are the little old ladies that
[SPEAKER_00]: were brand-new to cannabis the younger
kids they're experimenting they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed and see what they like and
they're hip and they're they talk fast and
[SPEAKER_00]: learn quick but The little old ladies that
would come in and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know since I tried smoking sometimes I
enjoy this and it's helping with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this I would ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your ailment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it your back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it your neck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it your back and your neck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it your knees at your stomach and I
would give them samples of products to
[SPEAKER_00]: take home and smoke those products and
come back and tell me the results they had
[SPEAKER_00]: with smoking that product and they'd be
like when I smoked the chocolate chunk I
[SPEAKER_00]: slept really good and the Maui Waui made
my head spin too much and the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: is too damn stinky like those are the kind
of reports we'd get from them but
[SPEAKER_00]: developing that relationship and learning
what would help these people it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most rewarding experience that is that
drove me deeper and deeper into growing
[SPEAKER_00]: into wanting to dial in my medicine and
defining specific strains for people one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things I really noticed was
happening when I was working with these
[SPEAKER_00]: older people is that they would tell me
they were able to eliminate some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines they were taking if they were
taking three medicines for pain and two to
[SPEAKER_00]: help them sleep the right cannabis would
solve all five of those pills problems
[SPEAKER_00]: then they don't have to take the pill
that's making them constipated because of
[SPEAKER_00]: these three pills and then they don't have
to take the pill that's messing up their
[SPEAKER_00]: vision because of this one pill then they
don't have to take their liver pill
[SPEAKER_00]: because all these other things are fucking
up their liver and their kidneys like they
[SPEAKER_00]: would just stop taking so many
pharmaceuticals and it was amazing to see
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis able to fill that role just fix
their bodies in such a magical way anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling but yes it is a beautiful
goal to try to minimize the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals that anybody is putting in
their body so great goal great passion let
[SPEAKER_00]: me stay on focus here I am quite stoned
and quite rambling big shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that allegedly possibly traded me
seeds for concentrates good job bro I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to talk about in the show
but you just got a shout out kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: the down low it goes on in this message it
says I also enjoy growing and breeding so
[SPEAKER_00]: much that I would like to pursue the idea
of opening my own seed company that is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite the endeavor that'll be quite the
task I hope you were in it but we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that more in just a moment it says
keeping good genetics around and helping
[SPEAKER_00]: others that need this medicine is where my
head is except I have no idea how to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue breeding wise then it says I'm
learning and I will get better and the
[SPEAKER_00]: business side and marketing scare me how
might one go about setting up a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company legally in a medical state all
right here's where the main part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question comes in how might one go about
setting up a seed company in a legal state
[SPEAKER_00]: that may have recreational past in the
near future sorry for the long message
[SPEAKER_00]: keep up the great work from Danny Potts so
our friend wants to start a seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: in a medical state that possibly will go
recreational in the very near future our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend straight up said that they are
intimidated or afraid of the marketing and
[SPEAKER_00]: business side that is not their forte
honestly that was not my specialty either
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started a seed company so that is
something I had to learn so my advice if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really going to do it maybe take a
small business school maybe get some
[SPEAKER_00]: business advisors do that stuff early
because I made so many mistakes as a small
[SPEAKER_00]: business as a person starting a business
but I did not know I was starting a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company when I started this I know you
asked how this started and for some advice
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way I could do that is kind of
start off by telling you how I fell into
[SPEAKER_00]: this let me just kind of segue into how I
fell into owning a seed company then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about developing your seed company
and some of the things that came with me
[SPEAKER_00]: starting mine that's just the best way to
make this episode happen so one two three
[SPEAKER_00]: here we go I started making seeds because
I was dissatisfied with what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing online I was paying a lot of
money for seeds they would come and half
[SPEAKER_00]: of them would be crushed because the
packaging was terrible sometimes customs
[SPEAKER_00]: would fucking take my seeds they wouldn't
even make it to my to my door a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times I'd grow them and they would be
intersex or they wouldn't even be what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were labeled I would order these
seeds that said they're gonna smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: gasoline and be covered in trichomes and
they would smell like fucking roses and
[SPEAKER_00]: have no trichomes and I was like that's
not really cool of you so I started
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding I found a few things that I did
like things that did kind of have some
[SPEAKER_00]: quality to it and then I just I wanted to
make more seeds and see what I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: and I started breeding for myself I made
seeds I found seeds that I liked I found
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that I liked I bred them together I
just kept playing around I was just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of making seeds for myself then I made a
lot of seeds then I started posting
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures to social media a friend
introduced me to Instagram they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: bro you should put some of the pictures
that killer weed on Instagram you'd get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good following and I was like I'm not
really into that sort of shit and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're missing out if you don't do it
so I thought I better post some pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: started posting pictures of my plants and
my dried buds and flowers to social media
[SPEAKER_00]: and people started saying bro your plants
are amazing where can we get seeds and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like I don't really sell seeds I don't
really sell seeds and people were like
[SPEAKER_00]: well you need to sell us seeds I didn't
make that many seeds I was just making
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for me to play with I would give
them and allegedly possibly well it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: said give them to my friends all over the
nation and all over the places people
[SPEAKER_00]: would have my seeds and they were growing
them and they're having great results and
[SPEAKER_00]: so they were asking for more seeds and so
I made the seeds that I had made for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I just went back and made larger
batches and started giving them out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends then I put them in a bunch of bags
and I labeled them with my email address
[SPEAKER_00]: and just what the cross was and a couple
of hints of what I thought they would grow
[SPEAKER_00]: like and I went to the very first high
times cannabis cup in Denver Colorado the
[SPEAKER_00]: first one they held in Denver I went there
and I passed out probably 500 free packs
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds just thinking I was going to give
them out to people because I had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and nothing to do with them I was
just giving them out thought it was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fun it was just just a gift to the
world I made a lot of seeds I got what I
[SPEAKER_00]: need out of it I have a lot I'm not gonna
grow them here are some seeds for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people shortly thereafter my inbox started
blowing up my friends that I'd been giving
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to were posting pictures of their
progress people were impressed by that so
[SPEAKER_00]: now third party third layer people I guess
were seeing the seeds that I had made and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said bro where did you get those and
my friend said this guy Rasta Jeff and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't even Rasta Jeff I was just Jeff on
the fucking Jeff I was just fucking Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet growing weed so like my
friend Rasta Jeff made these seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then fucking they all those people
contacted me then all those people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave seeds to with that cannabis cup they
started growing and they started having
[SPEAKER_00]: good results they started contacting me
asking for more seeds then the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with their social media people
they started posting shit then social
[SPEAKER_00]: media really made it blow up I was posting
quality photos my friends were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: quality products posting quality photos
giving out probably 500 they were
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between five and ten packs was
like five and ten seven packs of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe twelve packs of seeds randomly in a
package I'd walk around the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and if I saw somebody holding like
anything that hinted to me they were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go home and grow weed especially if
they had clones or grow nutrients or a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light I just hand them a package of
seeds now you've got everything you need
[SPEAKER_00]: go home and grow some weed passing out all
those seeds really did very well for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a name in the industry so I
guess I kind of accidentally started my
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company I started it out of pure
passion this was the seeds were made this
[SPEAKER_00]: is why I believe it is successful a big
part of why I believe it is successful it
[SPEAKER_00]: was an art that I made for myself it
wasn't something I was doing to make money
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't a product I was trying to pay
the bills with it was something that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated with what I was buying I wanted
to make a quality product for myself that
[SPEAKER_00]: was tailor-made for myself my favorite
thing about growing from seed is I can
[SPEAKER_00]: find the phenotype that if I'm growing in
a commercial grow we'll find the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: for the commercial grow if I'm gonna grow
in a grow tent we'll find the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: for the grow tent that's in a seed pack
you can find variation and find what you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like so I started breeding with those to
find what I loved and started making stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I thought was great for me that
worked for my grow environment and my
[SPEAKER_00]: situation luckily fortunately my situation
my environment was also a large part of
[SPEAKER_00]: regular the cannabis medical marijuana the
regular grower it was their environment
[SPEAKER_00]: their situation as well they had a small
home grow they needed plants that would
[SPEAKER_00]: finish in a certain amount of time they
were highly potent they gave them huge
[SPEAKER_00]: yields that had a variety of flavors
available on the menu that's what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking for just like me so it just
so happened that I was making a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that fit the market very well there was a
need and a demand for my product so I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fell into it it was right time right
place lots of passion I feel like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have thought hey man I need to pay
the rent what are we gonna do let's invent
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed company it would have failed I
would have done it wrong I did this
[SPEAKER_00]: organically I just I just did it and it
happened so a lot of my experience my
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge my information here is going to
be from experience most of my knowledge is
[SPEAKER_00]: from experience I honestly wish I would
have had more business knowledge but since
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting from scratch I can say get
yourself a business advisor accountant and
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer from the beginning to get all of
your paperwork in line so that's how I got
[SPEAKER_00]: started let me make sure I covered all of
my how I got started notes here I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to events and giving out lots of
seeds every event that was possible to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis cups we used to have the
cannabis cups here we'd have the secret
[SPEAKER_00]: cup we had the 710 cup we would have the
secret sash we would have there were so
[SPEAKER_00]: many events it was when cannabis first got
medically legal and then recreationally
[SPEAKER_00]: legal here we were doing events once a
month at least and I would go pass out
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and then eventually it came to
trading seeds and then eventually it
[SPEAKER_00]: became to vending seeds I used to be what
I would call the backpack backpack warrior
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fill my backpack up with a bunch
of seeds and just go to the events and
[SPEAKER_00]: sling seeds out of my backpack and then
one time I got kicked out of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cup because they're like dude you can't do
that pay for a booth and I realized that's
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely correct I should be a damn
grown-up and pay for a booth right after
[SPEAKER_00]: that a very well-known seed vendor invited
me to be a part of their booth at an event
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that I could really do well at
those events I didn't need anybody to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: my hand and help me out that I could just
get my own booth and then the next event I
[SPEAKER_00]: rented my own booth and things went crazy
from there I got all of the things it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to build a trade show booth we got
the banner in the back we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: tablecloth all the stuff to make a booth
look professional and from there it was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically game on built a website did all
that shit but uh going to all those events
[SPEAKER_00]: and passing shit out and meeting the
people and then continuing to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: events and put my face out in the
community and shaking their hands and
[SPEAKER_00]: being there that helps a lot with the
brand and that's a lot of how it got going
[SPEAKER_00]: just being there being part of the crew
just showing up smoking with everybody and
[SPEAKER_00]: having seeds and being the guy that's kind
of how it all happened so I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of notes here that we could get into
I wanted to get the organic part out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way so I have a couple of questions
you've got a couple of options you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start a seed business do you want to start
do you want to sell your seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: retail shops only or do you want to sell
them online I don't think that doing both
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really good idea and an option I know
there's one company that does sell their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in their retail store and you can
buy them online there are a lot of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: loopholes and things around that but you
should probably pick one do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them in your stores or do you want to
sell them online that's the first thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about if you sell them in the store
you have a lot of licensing to go around a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of overhead to cover a lot of
legalities to think about there is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of advantages you've got a storefront
people will just go there and buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that is very easy but they've got to
be regulated seeds there's a lot of rules
[SPEAKER_00]: around that then also people have to go
there to buy your seeds if you sell your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds online they can be sold people could
be buying my seeds right now from vendors
[SPEAKER_00]: while I'm here recording while I'm editing
this show I may be making a sale I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know about it because the seeds are
online they're being sold all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place and the vendors are handling that
for me I don't have to touch them anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff is done the seeds are being
sold that way online so you can set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: website or you can set up your own seed
brand and then just send the seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors and let them go that way how do
you want to do it do you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: brick-and-mortar storefront or do you want
the online presence it sounds kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do the store which is going to
be a lot more work a lot of legalities it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sounds like I keep saying this but
now is the time to get some business
[SPEAKER_00]: education either get yourself a small
business degree learn a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: small business or team up with a small
business advisor also you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: a lawyer anything time you're involved in
the cannabis business anything selling
[SPEAKER_00]: anything have a lawyer have somebody you
can call for quick questions big questions
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that can help you out a lot of
shit is going to come up make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your paperwork gets filed legally
if you're going to start an LLC nonprofit
[SPEAKER_00]: organization whatever you decide to do
however you decide to do it whichever
[SPEAKER_00]: works best for you so your business
advisor and whoever helps you fill this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out we'll have all that advice for
you there are things online that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you nobody nobody advertises with me for
that but there are websites that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you do that but make sure that you get a
lawyer and an accountant and a small
[SPEAKER_00]: business advisor or something like that to
help you out so you can start off properly
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it earlier I wish that I had had
some help when I got started I didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything correctly took a couple of
years to kind of fix some things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do right at the start not a big
deal it's just business shit that had to
[SPEAKER_00]: be resolved but paperwork and headaches
could have been resolved had I done it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly the first time so if you've
already got a commercial grow or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you already know all this stuff I'm not
sure if you've got a dispensary you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to start anyway make sure you get
advice a lawyer and an accountant those
[SPEAKER_00]: things all help you out and then make sure
that they're not friends you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: your lawyer and your accountant to be
buddies and then if the business advisor
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want them teaming up against you
make sure that your money is being watched
[SPEAKER_00]: by everybody make sure they're all after
each other because when they team up on
[SPEAKER_00]: you that's when shit can go wrong so
lawyer up get yourself an accountant get
[SPEAKER_00]: that business advisor then you're going to
have to build a reputation that's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardest parts about creating a seed
company sure you made a bunch of seeds now
[SPEAKER_00]: what what are you gonna do with them why
does anybody want those seeds what comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of those seeds have you built a
reputation you're going to have to give
[SPEAKER_00]: away seeds people are gonna have to grow
them they're gonna have to see what comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from them you're going to have to grow
them that's the first step make seeds grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them find something you know is worth
putting to market then put it to market
[SPEAKER_00]: have it tested all over the place we'll
talk about testers in a little bit have it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested in so many different environment
situations then if you feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go to market put it out there but
you're gonna have to build a reputation
[SPEAKER_00]: why does anybody want to buy your seeds
what do you offer what do you bring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table that's not already there of course
if you've got that storefront people are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in to buy product already maybe
seeds are an upsell maybe they just happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to be looking for seeds maybe you're the
only shop on the block with seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: always helps but what is going to drive
people to your brand how do you build a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation how do you build the demand and
then once you've built a reputation and
[SPEAKER_00]: built a demand how do you continue those
people to keep coming back for your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you create sustainability you've
always got to be creating new stuff which
[SPEAKER_00]: means you've always got to have stuff out
testing as a breeder the stuff that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see being released now I've got stuff that
will come out this fall I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be late this year early next year
but there is stuff coming out what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: calling out it'll be the winter stuff
coming out the winter the winter release
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually made last winter so those
seeds are finally being released it took
[SPEAKER_00]: about a year to get them processed I grew
them I made sure they're good I sent them
[SPEAKER_00]: out to testers the testers are growing
them then I sent out a round of like
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary testers to people like hey I
think these are really killer you should
[SPEAKER_00]: try these like to my bros who are good
photographers and shit like that they got
[SPEAKER_00]: them next now pretty soon they're gonna
make it to market it takes a year so
[SPEAKER_00]: you've always got to be producing new
crosses you've got to be testing them and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them out and you've got to have a
reliable product it only takes one bad
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of seeds to root in a breeder's
reputation I've seen it happen to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: if you pay attention to the seed game
you've seen people that were around for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time put out one or two bad batches
of seeds then they disappeared their
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation is shot they're at the events
they used to have a line around the block
[SPEAKER_00]: for their booth now there's just a few
people coming up because they ruin their
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation by putting out a few bad one or
two bad batches of seeds so you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: build a reputation you've got to become
relevant why do people want your seeds why
[SPEAKER_00]: how do people know who you are then once
they've got one pack why are they gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: come back for another pack of seeds you've
got to build longevity and sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: as a seed company there's a lot of work to
that to doing that now let's talk about oh
[SPEAKER_00]: another factor it's oversaturated there
are a million seed companies out there if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to the larger vendors on the
internet and you click on like let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: say seeds here now calm look at the the
vast amount of vendors of retailers of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed breeders that are on that website it
is overwhelming there are a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: on there it's oversaturated so how are you
gonna stand out from an oversaturated
[SPEAKER_00]: market I'm not trying to discourage you
I'm asking you the real questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: come up in a business meeting why does
anybody want to buy your seeds why do you
[SPEAKER_00]: stand out from the plethora of other
breeders why not to sound egotistical why
[SPEAKER_00]: does somebody want to buy your seeds over
my seeds I've been around for my brand has
[SPEAKER_00]: been around for a while my podcast has
existed for six years the seeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: around for much longer than that I've got
a six-year at least six-year podcast head
[SPEAKER_00]: start on you where people know about my
brand you've been seeing my stuff why do
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to buy yours I'm not belittling
or criticizing I'm asking a real business
[SPEAKER_00]: question what are you gonna do to convince
them to buy your seeds when mine are right
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the shelf next to them that's
just a real question in business so now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's work into part of the thing part of
the things that are required from a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder if you want to own a seed company
it will be a full-time commitment this
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a job a business if you've already
got a backup plan you're not in it to win
[SPEAKER_00]: it there is no way out there's no other
idea if you're gonna start a seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what you're going to be doing it
is a full-time job it is a full commitment
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a nine days a week fucking 32 hour a
day job sometimes when I'm recording
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts I'm just trying to get them done
before the Sun comes up in this window
[SPEAKER_00]: behind me you have no idea how many hours
a seed breeder small business owner puts
[SPEAKER_00]: in every week I'm not complaining by any
means I love it I'm my own boss I work
[SPEAKER_00]: when I want how I want if I want to take a
dad break we take a dad break that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: how it goes but we get a lot of shit done
it's how it is owning your own business
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about just kind of a basic day
of a small business owner you get up you
[SPEAKER_00]: do your normal morning routine I don't
know what you do get some food in you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably poop get some coffee I don't
drink coffee but whatever gets started
[SPEAKER_00]: right then there is garden work to do the
first thing that I do is take care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden the plants need attention if it's
the home grow if it's a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: always knock out the plant work first
thing if I got to go to a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I hit two commercial grows in a
day go make sure that all the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: good teach the staff what to do then get
back to my personal grow take care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow the plants are done
sometimes there's not much to do to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants sometimes there are hours and hours
of work to do to the plants maybe you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do transplanting maybe you have to cut
clones you have to keep the plants alive
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to breed them you have to do all
of the plant work you have to harvest them
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to get the seeds out of them
that's a lot of work to be done with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants then then after that try to take a
little bit of a break take a shower get a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick shower get a quick shower got on
your team that you've got to check in with
[SPEAKER_00]: probably once a week, once every two
weeks, at least once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to check in with the lawyer,
got to check in with the accountant at
[SPEAKER_00]: least once a month and see what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check in with touch all the bases,
make sure everybody's still on your team,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the taxes have been paid,
make sure that everything is current,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure all the licenses are up to date,
do all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only up to lunchtime right now,
we're still making phone calls,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants have already been watered,
we haven't even got to checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the web guide, there are website
updates to be made, then there's the art
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, I'm having new merchandise made and
new seed packages designed, so I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: check in with the art guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the art guy, hope you're
well bro, also fist bump to the web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the merch team, I've got to
check in with customstickermakers.com and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if the stickers are being printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to check on the t-shirts, also got to
check on the mood mats, where are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they were shipping those around
the 15th, here we are like the 27th and
[SPEAKER_00]: those definitely have not shipped,
I haven't even gotten pictures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: proofs yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to email them again and see where
those things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just a bunch of things that you
have to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then testers, testers are a big part of
being a successful seed company,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to develop a relationship with
your testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I make a new cross, I know the parents
of that cross, I know the grandparents of
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross and possibly the great
grandparents on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to grow that plant like a
champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professional grower with a lot of
experience and I know all of the details
[SPEAKER_00]: of that plant, I've got the fucking cheat
code for that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the people that are going to see
what it grows like under this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, with this humidity, with this type
of nutrient, in a tent, in a basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to see that sort of stuff
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to develop a relationship with
your test crew, which again, puts you back
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting at the desk, answering emails,
doing FaceTime calls, checking the social
[SPEAKER_00]: media, checking in with all of the
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testers are a big part of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the testers, I would not have had
the chance to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be years behind without the
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do all the testing that they do
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a thousand seeds went out to be
tested in the past week, so the testers
[SPEAKER_00]: are a big part of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in testing,
people are going to start emailing me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a podcast all about testing,
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester episode is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch that before you send me a message
asking about testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the details are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then join the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tester tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the video first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only halfway through the day,
and we've only gotten to the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do have a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got people I want to hang out with
and talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes I want to eat dinner and
take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a seed breeder and owning a seed
company, what I'm getting at is a
[SPEAKER_00]: full-time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you are in it to win it and fully
dedicated, I really wouldn't suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into that unless you can commit to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we should talk about is
building a fan base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this earlier a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Becoming relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people want to buy your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've got them, how do you
retain them?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can develop a solid fan base of
just a solid number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have approximately 200 Patreon
supporters, and there's about 500 to 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: people that really support me very
strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a close group of 250 people of
anything I put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a grinder, a t-shirt, a pack of
seeds, they'll grab it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a group of about 500 people,
the Fringe, that buy a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's 1,000 people that buy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just build a nice little
following like that, that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about going major too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly build and have a loyal following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make some friends that are in your
fan base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate even calling them fan base or
following, but you guys know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the people that follow you on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They interact with you the most online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start learning some of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start building relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I go hang out in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know shit about my personal life that
you guys that watch the podcast don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: about or have no idea about, but we know
what's going on in each other's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get pictures of my friends at other
friends' houses trimming irie genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, and that is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Lollipop Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But build a relationship with those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testers and the loyal fan base,
they keep me afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep life going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep the wheels turning, so you've
got to be grateful and loyal to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to show love back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a band that peep those people
down in the front that are in the mosh pit
[SPEAKER_00]: for every fucking show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to throw them some t-shirts every
once in a while and help them out because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the people that make you
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without them, you would not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without my fan base, without the people
watching this, without the people watching
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, I would just be some
psychopath with two cameras, a microphone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and way too many fucking toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the people buying the seeds,
I would not be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not eat dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be skinnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have a nice shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life wouldn't be what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to show love to the people
that show you love when you become a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget where you came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget the people that make you who
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that the day you get started
with this idea of making a seed company,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are already working on your reputation
as that seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that already know you are
putting your character and your reputation
[SPEAKER_00]: into your seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be fair with your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have quality customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention that I spend about at least
an hour or two every day answering
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service emails?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to say,
no, he doesn't because he doesn't reply to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about 30,000 emails that I try to
answer and it's overwhelming because every
[SPEAKER_00]: time you answer them, they reply and you
have more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys and I'm not mad about it,
but I'm a one person operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the podcast, the seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to keep up with it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for keeping me overloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the main part of this question was
how might one go about setting up a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company legally and a medical state?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first advice, lawyer up, get that
accountant, get that business advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they are on your team guiding
you so that you don't make any legal
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes and get yourself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then breed high quality, highly tested
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed the product that you are proud to
put out to your consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not proud to put it out,
if you wouldn't be happy buying it,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't put it out to your consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a loyal fan base, connect with them,
and then stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the future of seed breeding
and the future of seed purchasing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to project that and try to stay on top
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I have done, I try not to
fuck with the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are enough people out there doing
the hype shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to dodge that and do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is why I think it works
because I'm not doing what everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing, what everybody else wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing what is working for me,
what I love, and then my art is showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm putting passion into it,
and that makes it desirable and
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line, grow from your heart and
breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you a lot of good advice
because I got super rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is a topic I could really
ramble about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that lawyer, get that accountant,
get the business advisor, then breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: breed, breed, test, test, test,
then package them up, put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf, and get them out there to the
people, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be available for customer service
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be available for events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to put you on shows and
interview you, be available for those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That camera just cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is obviously time to wrap up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, and Paul and
Chuckers, thank you once again for
