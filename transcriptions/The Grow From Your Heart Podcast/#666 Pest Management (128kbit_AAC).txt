talk about growing, answer a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I'm packing up seeds or
getting orders together, I just hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chat and hang out with the friends.

[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I do cordially invite you
to join us on the Discord server and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, there is a link in the show notes
and in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I did say this episode was
going to be about integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to ramble too much here at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to use my voice for the lesson here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, can you do a series on integrated
pest management?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I replied with, there is so much to
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into details on each
specific pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about basic integrated
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the first step to making sure we
don't get a, we're going to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me start by saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to experience bugs in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stop everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the best way to learn how to
prevent a pest is to get a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to learn how to eradicate a
pest is to get that pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never learn about a problem until you
have to face it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get problems in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs are going to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is going to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how life goes in a grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's indoors, outdoors,
greenhouse, whatever you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the huge opportunity, very high
likelihood for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're growing in an area
where I grow, where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody works in a commercial facility
or a dispensary or their boyfriend or
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin or roommate or somebody is involved
in a grow somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all trading bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to a house to go play video games or
smoke with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sit on the couch and you're just
passing spider mites back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to your other friend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the mites there or you get their
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it works when everybody
works in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the bugs discourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them scare you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know what to do and how to identify
bugs before the time comes, we don't panic
[SPEAKER_00]: as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to be prepared, try to read about
what's coming, try to know what to expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to Google and research things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a little bit of that work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how well you set up your grow,
how well you design your things,
[SPEAKER_00]: things may happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel like you've done something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like you've got shame or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got something to hide if you've got
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good learning opportunity and the
pride will come when you defeat the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and have a successful crop even
though you did have some fears in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning or middle of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that is my kind of
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that, a preface there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get bugs and don't feel
like you failed or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common, especially in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number one way to prevent problems
is to have a plan in place before problems
[SPEAKER_00]: ever even start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, learn how to
identify bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said that I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal to grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have six plants in my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got six plants in their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody my age, my age range, if you're 21
to 45, maybe 60, you've probably got six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a medical marijuana
recommendation, you can have six more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have up to 12 plants in your
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there's probably one house on
every block growing, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's about that average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that here in Colorado, everybody,
like I said, has got spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, fungus gnats, thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all the basic bugs because we're
just trading it from commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What bugs pop up where you live?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing indoors, outdoors,
greenhouse environment, what kind of bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: are known to be present in gardens where
you live?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors, you could do a quick
little Google search and find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bugs are going to show up in an
outdoor garden, and you can be prepared to
[SPEAKER_00]: battle those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what their eggs look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what kind of signs they leave on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see their poop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make bite marks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see eggs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of things will indicate that bugs are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how to find them and have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan of attack before you even get
the bugs, and it will help you out
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of training ahead of time,
and you'll know how to react without going
[SPEAKER_00]: into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panic mode, panic mode in the garden
causes more problems than it ever fixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people just decide to do random
crazy shit because they had a problem that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a level two, and they're like,
well, then I sprayed, I defoliated,
[SPEAKER_00]: I overwatered, I changed the light cycle,
and then I fed it completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and I'm like, well,
you just took that level two problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: made it a level seven by doing too many
damn things to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're doing,
know how to not panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a much more likelihood of a
successful rescue or an eradication of a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know what problems are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of bugs are in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most common bugs for every grow,
you're going to see spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats, thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's other stuff that we'll
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are common, especially if you're
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets worms and caterpillars
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare for those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next step is to think how nuclear
or organic do you want to go to treat your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden for pest prevention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to spray heavy pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to spray heavy fungicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you only going to go with organic
pesticides and fungicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you not going to spray at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use predator bugs in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many very useful insects that we
can order.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can purchase them online or locally
from insectiaries if you have one near
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get live bugs delivered to your
grow and you can disperse those live
[SPEAKER_00]: insects in your grow and they will eat the
problem bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will stick around if you buy the
right insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make babies and they'll keep
breeding in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bugs are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't eat your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cause any problems and they
work as security guards for the other
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some spider mites show up, they eat
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do decide to use sprays as your
plant of attack for pests and fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: how harsh or gentle of a chemical will you
allow yourself to use in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to use something that is crazy
from some Monsanto product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you just want to use some hippie oil
sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your boundary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your threshold there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will and will you not use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start researching the products and find
out what you are comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil will make, if you're going to use
your finished product for concentrates or
[SPEAKER_00]: any... I don't like neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil will stick around in the flavor
of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those botanical oils and essential
oils are not good for growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, because they stick around
and you will taste it in the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product if you use it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find my notes again and see where I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use predator bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a note here that says,
in my opinion, lady bugs are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are going to throw
their arms up in the air and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, for their price,
they are not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hungry enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not aggressive enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't stick around long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You release a shit ton of lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many lady bugs you release,
tomorrow you're only going to have half of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's indoors, outdoors, greenhouse,
whatever, half of them are going to fly
[SPEAKER_00]: into the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of them are going to fly into the
blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of them are just going to die because
they don't have any food or they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they're doing or it's just
overpopulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: With lady bugs suddenly, they just die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by halfway through that day,
you've only got a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of that day, you've probably
got a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my experience with lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let a bunch of them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up sweeping them up, shop vacing
them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up crunching them on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to mop up the floor because
you've got scattered, splattered lady bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't prefer lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people talk about it all the time on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lady bugs are amateur hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are much more aggressive and
qualified bugs out there to do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swarovski's, persimilis, hypoaspis miles,
green lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going fast, but you can do some
research and you can find those bugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which predators work in your environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go shopping for predator insects,
you can do a lot of research on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the website you were looking at
will tell you this predator bug prefers
[SPEAKER_00]: this temperature range and this humidity
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs do have a VPD, which they prefer
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that type of a VPD,
then you may want to get a different bug
[SPEAKER_00]: or your insects that you just bought,
your troopers, your army, your soldiers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may come for a little while and hang
out and eat a couple of bugs and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too hot in here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to find an escape route
and they're going to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to go to a garden where
it's a more appropriate temperature or
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll quit breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll quit eating and they will die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find out the appropriate predators for
your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the good companies, you can call
them and they will give you advice and
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, this is my greenhouse,
my indoor, my outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe be vague about cannabis,
but just they don't care what plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about canopy size and bug infestation
and bug pressure is what they will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to know canopy size,
temperature, humidity, environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental swings, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to want to know what
pest are you trying to eradicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a good idea of which insects you
need for your environment and also be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for which insects are coming to
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very commonly, you're going to get spider
mites, thrips, fungus gnats, aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors, you're going to get
those moths that lay eggs in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: those moths turn into worms and they
become caterpillars and they become
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we get a lot of melon worms
here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're orange worms that grow in the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll really wreak havoc on your plants
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which insects do you think you're going
to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if they're cost effective for
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you afford those insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how you're going to disperse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have to be hung up on each
individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some come in a container and you just take
off the lid and they start climbing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to move them around a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your grow,
it may require a little bit of manpower to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out those sachets or however they
are delivered to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see where I'm in my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which predators are you going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which bugs are you going to battle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you capable of spraying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how physically capable you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to mix up a five gallon,
10, maybe a 20 gallon container of water
[SPEAKER_00]: with pesticides mixed into it,
with fungicides mixed into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you may have to spray a large
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your physical limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep in mind some people aren't
completely physically able like some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you need to get predator bugs and
let them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have to spray because you can't
disperse the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to work best for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you physically manage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a crew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a staff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a helper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a couple strapping young lads
out there that can just be in the heat all
[SPEAKER_00]: day putting out bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe a guy that can suit up in the
middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't turn off the lights if you're in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're outside or whatever,
do you have a guy that can spray when the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun goes down or before the sun comes up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somebody capable of spraying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be able to stick to a
routine and a cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the bugs delivered on a
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set up a deal with the places that
deliver the bugs, they can come once a
[SPEAKER_00]: week, every two weeks, twice a week,
however you want to set up a routine and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll know what's best for you depending
on the infestation, the pest pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the beneficial insect you're buying and
the environment in which you're putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insectiaries will have great
recommendations on frequency and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they will try to sell you extra,
but it is always better to have extra
[SPEAKER_00]: security guards than not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more on your team so that the
other team can't take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your gang is bigger, you got a better
chance of winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going to figure out where I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about spraying now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying indoors, that is a good
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am hesitant of spraying outdoors because
in my opinion, I don't want to disrupt the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do a lot of outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have a greenhouse project happening
this year that I haven't talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't do a lot of outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to grow outdoors, I would use
beneficial insects and predator bugs as my
[SPEAKER_00]: way of taking care of pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My reasoning for not wanting to spray
outside is I feel it disrupts the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside is already doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, if we don't mess with it,
outside is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are what mess up outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get a bug out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something most likely is going to eat that
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that bug is either going to move on
or try to make home in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in most cases, another bug will come
get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have to draw the line somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just have a bug battle happening
in our plants every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things, like I've seen
spider mites build webs and take over
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens really quickly without any
interaction or prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that outside, if we mess around
too much, we do cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion, my preference would be to use
the beneficial insects for the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, we're not spraying things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not destroying the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That patch of land you're growing on may
be yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be somebody else's land you just
snuck on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, treat that land with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 10 by 10 patch of land may be yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything around it is ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody out there owns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody next door to you owns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment that it is actually a part
of is all of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please respect it and take good care of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your sprays are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're doing to the
earth, the environment, the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff, we're sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that most people listening to my
show are gonna be very gentle and very
[SPEAKER_00]: courteous and very mindful, but still,
keep in mind that that patch of land that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucking up for this one grow season
to have a successful crop, that's also our
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be here forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that land outlives you and there
are other generations that have to live on
[SPEAKER_00]: that land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not make it have to live on that
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it they get to live on that
land that you did not destroy,
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it infertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that to the land around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough of my hippie
ramble, but really, you guys, keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in mind when you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spraying your area, but where's the
drift going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the pesticide going?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the long-term effects you are
doing to that plot of land?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing to the ecosystem,
the balance, the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're gonna say, yeah,
but you're gonna release a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna help the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna, it's not chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna change the earth for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gonna help out my fellow
neighbor growers by eating their pests as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me find my notes and get
back where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I did mention this already,
but think about your strategy before it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time to attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we don't want bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we don't wanna have to get in there
or go out there and attack a bunch of bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to fix a problem, but have a plan
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I keep talking about greenhouse
environments, indoor, outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a huge piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have built a nice indoor
environment, you've hung up your lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've put up the reflective coating on
the wall, you've cleaned up the flooring
[SPEAKER_00]: real well, you went and bought a bunch of
brand new gear, we ran ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a carbon filter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing plants indoors,
please don't take them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're gonna wanna take them
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like taking them for a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna go get them some fresh air,
some sunshine, go expose them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but you're also going to
expose them to all of the bugs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and then you're gonna bring that
precious plant with its new passengers,
[SPEAKER_00]: its stowaways, into your beautiful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in your grow, you are creating the
most perfect environment, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the most ideal environment for
that plant, but also that's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal, beautiful, perfect environment for
whatever bugs you just brought in on that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna have a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna say, dude, it is 77 degrees
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the perfect humidity in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too much wind in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light cycle is the same constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no dew in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just have a party in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the island of Jamaica for the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just gonna start partying and then
they're gonna start breeding in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then within a couple of days, you're gonna
go, oh, I really fucked up putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant outside and bringing it back in here
because there's nothing to stop that
[SPEAKER_00]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna breed and they're gonna eat
and they're gonna breed and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: eat and they're just gonna take over your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really recommend not taking your
plants outside and bringing them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got indoor plants, they should
be indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got outdoor plants, those are
outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got greenhouse plants,
those are greenhouse plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I wouldn't recommend bringing,
I see it all the time on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the plants outside today for a couple
of hours and I'm like, oh, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take them indoors and contaminate the
entire grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you gotta re-clean that whole grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've created that beautiful indoor
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just leave that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about thinking about what we
might use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about identifying our bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to identify bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have an infestation now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about now, while you're listening to
me, maybe just Google spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: two-spotted spider mites, russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google all of the common spider mites that
could be found in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's start looking for what a spider
mite damage look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody just took your
leaves and just started poking it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little needle and all the juices came out
of that leaf where you poked it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just starts getting dry and they call it
stipule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stipule, I think that's the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned it in art class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody was just poking at
that leaf and just trying to just poke it
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a little, it'll look gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be green and then it'll kind of
gradient to like a dead yellowy color and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the spider mites are just
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably on the underside of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull off that leaf and take a look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right along the main vein of the leaves,
the long main vein, they'll be tucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: there under the edge trying to hide,
laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need a microscope or some sort
of magnification, but pull off a leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna find them right there at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn to identify the bugs which we are
expecting to encounter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to identify spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to identify, ooh, the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, one of the worst insects to
face, I'm not afraid of most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can battle and conquer almost any
infestation you'll get in a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a home grow, a commercial
environment, a greenhouse, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the expert, but most other places
we will conquer all problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest fear, my biggest adversary
would be the russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are the fucking devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to identify the signs of their
presence in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will trick you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make you think you've got
nutrient problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make you think you've got water
filtering problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make you think the plants are just
doing weird shit and then you'll realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I've got russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites are the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest problem in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know how to get rid of them,
but it does take a little bit of some
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy and some persistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be on top of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn to identify those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotted mites, spider mites, russet mites,
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are easy because aphids have
tailpipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a little Volkswagen Beetle
with tailpipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two exhaust pipes coming out of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids always have exhaust pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come in all colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing new colors of aphids
which I've never seen before in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like every year we get a new color of
aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got a little green bug,
a little white bug, a little, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: purple, brown, yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them of all colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a blue aphid yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't seen purple or blue aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, aphids can be all colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those weird looking little shiny
Volkswagen Beetle looking things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are possibly aphids in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't see the thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will see is honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they just, it looks like
they blew their nose or something blew its
[SPEAKER_00]: nose on your lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be on the bottom leaves of the plant
because the thrips likes to go hang out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and they come up at night and
they shit all over your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's called honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips are super easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: People panic when they see thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are easy, easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies, you may confuse a thrip or a
fungus gnat let me fucking try to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may confuse a whitefly with an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it flies away when you tap the plant,
that's a whitefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll be watering and you'll
bump the plant just gently just like I did
[SPEAKER_00]: this mic stand and you'll just see little
ashy bugs come flying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bitches are whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to eradicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more of an annoyance than a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a vector and lead to further
issues but really they're more just
[SPEAKER_00]: annoying and obnoxious than anything else
and they fuck up your pictures and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats are obnoxious and they fly
around as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tap the pot and these little
blackflies come out, those little bitches
[SPEAKER_00]: are fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably from over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't over water as frequently,
let the soil dry up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have less likelihood for fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've learned if you run Canon
LED lighting from Black Sail Market,
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to my buddy Keith at Black
Sail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run the Canon LEDs, the diode is
about the size of a 50 cent piece and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the fungus gnats are attracted to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly right into that 50 cent piece of
a light and they fall directly down onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that is right below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just go scoop them up off of that
plant and you'll be able to identify your
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know it's like a little indicator,
a little marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know they're there because that LED
light is just nuking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't resist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly right into it and they hit it and
they go, oh that's too hot and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: cook and they just fall right onto the
plants below.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I did mention that outdoors
you're going to get caterpillars and melon
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not the easiest to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to treat with probably
some spray products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what predators are large
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a praying mantis, maybe a giant
lacewing, maybe big enough to eat some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those caterpillars and melon beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things you're gonna see
outdoors, possibly in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't get those in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: More stuff you might see, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it's powdery mildew season
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature swings, humidity swings,
diurnal swings will definitely lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overfoliation, overleafy plants,
low circulation, things like that will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely lead to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is definitely something
you'll run into in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment very commonly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it here in Colorado because we have
a lot of drastic temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is not very hard to get rid
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very easy to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray a few products on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some organic products that you
could spray that will work as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't gonna talk a lot about stuff like
that, but I like for a preventative and a
[SPEAKER_00]: corrective product in a powdery mildew
situation, I like the products Cease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it, but I've seen a lot of
great success with GreenCure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it really gets nasty,
Zero Tall 2.0 is not organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you spray it with the Cease or a
combination of the two, you'll prevent a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice protective layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are beneficial bacterias that eat
the powdery mildew or one of them eats the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: One creates a surface, a pH on the leaf
surface that makes it undesirable for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew to colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a couple of ways to help you
prevent powdery mildew prevention there
[SPEAKER_00]: from a fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that indoors, outdoors,
greenhouse environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cease is organic, it's a little bit
expensive, but it's cheaper than powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing that is very important
when it comes to integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management is scouting and indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know the signs of pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about a couple of things to
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites, you're gonna see stipuling,
little pokies, you're gonna see little
[SPEAKER_00]: crawly bugs on the bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see webbing, you've got spider
mites and you have not been paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get in there and get rid of
those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aphids, you're gonna see little
skittles crawling around your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips, you're gonna see the honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies, you'll see the ashes flying
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats are little black things
flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillars and melon beetles and orange
worms, those are gonna be obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew looks like you're starting
to put powdered sugar on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you were eating a powdered
doughnut and just dribbled it right onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the signs of bugs and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pay attention for bud rot,
but that's a little bit later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season when you've got buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the inside of that bud looks brown and
squishy and shitty, you've got bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that happened to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scouting and indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the whole crew, if you're working
with a crew, more people than just
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, do they all know what they're
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a specific person scouting
every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should look at every plant every
single day if you're looking for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be one person or a team of
people trained to identify and scout for
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your indicators?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use yellow sticky traps in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they're thinking that that
is a pest eradicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a way to get rid of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is simply there to tell you,
you have got pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the yellow sticky trap every
day, maybe twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take a peek at it before you leave
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a peek when you come back and see how
many bugs are sticking to that yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get a few bugs just because
life has bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are bugs wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you saw the little gnat flying
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some mosquitoes or something
stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you have a bunch of white flies or
a bunch of fungus gnats or a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: something unidentifiable stuck to those
sticky cards?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them be indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see that number getting
towards concerning, it's time to step up
[SPEAKER_00]: your prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe start doing an eradication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe start putting more beneficial
insects into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to start rethinking your
strategy if you were seeing the numbers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cards get too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're defoliating, don't be afraid
to take off a few leaves and flip them
[SPEAKER_00]: upside down and take a moment to see what
you've got going on on the bottom of those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there eggs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a minute with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about plant damage and
other signs of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see signs of trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see plant damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told you what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in there every day looking for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already tell you it's the one in the
back corner that you don't fuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that's got the bugs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back there and look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it kisses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you avoiding that one plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it do to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that one in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always just back there or back there
in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one with bugs and those bugs
are going to move on pretty soon and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be in the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for signs of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what kind of bugs are doing
that damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you know how to react properly with
intent and purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you see bug damage doesn't
mean you need to go get pesticide A and
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily spray pesticide A.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the pesticide you just got is for
spider mites and the bugs that you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: are thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to do anything or did you just
spray the plants with some stressful shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some energy on the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's identify the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research on the appropriate
product or beneficial insect to eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that pest and apply with intent and
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you need to apply this
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days apart do I need to wait to
apply this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: What other products can I apply with this
and what other products can I not apply
[SPEAKER_00]: with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things you can't mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things you can mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things you shouldn't spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe five to seven days apart from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you treat with any sulfur products,
don't treat with any oils for five to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days before or after and the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfurs and oils should not mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you huge problems on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready to react properly with intent and
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good idea is to have multiple modes
of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got swarski's and persimilis and
hypoaspis miles and lace wings in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three different bugs going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't run and hide from three or four
different bugs, but if you've got a tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mix with multiple ingredients,
you can spray multiple things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you hit with multiple modes of
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pesticides simply make the plants
undesirable for the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs are like, oh, that's sticky and
stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other pesticides will infect your bugs
with a mushroom or a fungus that grows
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of them and then explodes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other pesticides will simply make the bugs
forget to eat and then they just don't eat
[SPEAKER_00]: and they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pesticides will make the bugs unable
to breed, so they'll just keep going,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can't make any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I hit you with the pesticide that
makes you not want to breed and forget to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just not eating and you're
not breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just walking around going,
I don't have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you die and you don't come back
and the bugs are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hit with multiple modes of
attack, you can definitely eradicate your
[SPEAKER_00]: problems more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about multiple modes of attack
and multiple products in a tank mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs will get what is known as resistance
to a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about if you walk in the room
every day and I punch you right in the jaw
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one, it's going to fucking hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day two, it's going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day three, it's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day four, all right, I got punched in the
jaw again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day five, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day six, right in the jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 12, you're just going to walk out
the door and you're just going to put your
[SPEAKER_00]: jaw up there and take it and keep doing
your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep spraying the bugs the same
thing over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to start drinking it up like
Kool-Aid and it's not going to do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take very long for some of
these new bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've evolved these bugs so quickly by
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've developed such quick resistance to
pesticides that we've got to rotate and
[SPEAKER_00]: use multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotate your pesticides to prevent
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that the bug lady Suzanne says,
you cannot build a resistance to being
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use those predator bugs,
they will always win because you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: build a resistance to being eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no resistance, especially if you
power in numbers, if you overdo it with
[SPEAKER_00]: those predator insects, you will
definitely win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already said that I don't like neem
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like oils with a lot of
fragrances, especially like spearmint
[SPEAKER_00]: oils, peppermint oils, any of that sticky
oil that you spray on the plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see it kind of stick and leave a shine
onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like spraying that sort of stuff
because I make a lot of concentrates out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke a concentrate that is
oil-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make concentrates from products
that have been sprayed with oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see an experienced concentrate
maker, consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even an experienced maker and I
can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the oils float to the top of the
concentrates when you're putting oils and
[SPEAKER_00]: weird sprays and shit in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people know how to remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to do that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my area of expertise,
but I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can identify it on the top of the
concentrates, a little oily sheen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like if you mix oil and water
together, you can watch the oil float.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the pesticides when the products
are being processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like a lot of crazy hippie oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather just go with a pesticide or
insects than some of those lower level
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie oils they sell at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know which brands I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skip all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're going to spray,
spray properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to spray the top of the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to spray the underside of the
leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some products like to be sprayed what is
called two runoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spray the plants until they're just
fucking dripping to where you got a puddle
[SPEAKER_00]: of pesticide or offspray around the bottom
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pesticides do not want to be sprayed
to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want you to spray the plant with
enough just to get enough of it on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some of them, you got to spray the
underside of the leaf extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got spider mites, you need to spray
the underside of the leaves because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the bugs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying for powdery mildew,
you need to spray the top because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the powdery mildew is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand how to spray properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, understand the pesticides you are
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I probably should have
started with, but every bottle that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use has a booklet on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up that booklet and read about the
reentry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you spray a pesticide, there's amount
of time you should leave your grow and not
[SPEAKER_00]: enter that because those pesticides are
fresh and flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just sprayed bubbles in there and you
got wet pesticide in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be rubbing up against
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that in your lungs,
in your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something called the reentry
interval written on that booklet on your
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much information in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dosage recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a part that tells you what
personal protective equipment to wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wear the appropriate personal
protective equipment when applying any
[SPEAKER_00]: type of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just spraying water,
if you're making small enough bubbles,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to wear a mask or a respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to inhale micronized bubbles
of anything into my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got enough shit to deal with right now
with our lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to not poison, contaminate and
injure ourselves while trying to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proper personal protective equipment at
all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be listed inside of the pesticide
book right on the front of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just pull out this one little book.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the info you need is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to take you a couple of
minutes and it may really, really help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use all of the recommended personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always use gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend like a paper tie back suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't invest in that, get a long
sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some long pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wear shoes and socks in the grow
that cover up your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottoms of your feet are one of the
most absorbent parts for contaminants and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about spray a pesticide,
drips off the plant, lands on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're barefoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You step on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get maximum pesticide
absorption and exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you could possibly get through the
bottoms of your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course your genitals, cause you got
that thin soft skin, armpits face,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the bottoms of your feet are a prime
spot for you to accidentally contaminate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please wear the appropriate personal
protective equipment and read the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about the equipment, the reentry
intervals and learn about the toxicity
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of those products you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it say like warning, hazard,
danger, poison?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have words like that on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also maybe have the MSDS sheets available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe have a spray log available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial environment,
those are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a personal grow, you can get
crazy and willy nilly with all that shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still it would be a good idea to have
a binder with an MSDS log for all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply find every product you've got
and go to the internet, go to the website,
[SPEAKER_00]: type in whatever product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to, I don't have any liquid
products near me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, I can see a bottle of cease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cease biological pesticide or
fungicide, whatever it says on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cease product, MSDS sheet and you'll
find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every product has an MSDS sheet available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to print it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I make, I buy these little,
it's like a little laminate folder that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd keep like for a presentation and a
folder and I just print them off and I
[SPEAKER_00]: slide them all into there and make a
notebook out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if anything does go wrong,
if I do end up sick, if I do ingest
[SPEAKER_00]: something, I can grab that folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grab my pesticide log and I can go
to the hospital and I can say there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably clues in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can help me out or maybe
somebody can take that shit for me if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just good ideas to protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a different, uh, strategy if
you were in what is known as a red state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't, that's all evidence at
this point in a red state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like to have, uh, the MSDS
sheets, a spray log, try to have all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff available in case you never know
what could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trained by the department of
agriculture, uh, the Colorado department
[SPEAKER_00]: of agriculture to keep those types of
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, uh,
it's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have all that stuff for,
I think, uh, three to five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all has to be kept on file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the compliance officer knows how many
years she keeps it all for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, shout out to your compliance
officer, wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those books, keep all that stuff
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, I was saying I'm,
uh, trained by the department of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe it would be a good time to
drop my credentials in here since I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about pesticides, applications,
all this safety and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going, well, who the hell are you,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a training from the Colorado
department of agriculture and the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: state university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trained by a very great lady named
Theo Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took like a, it was either a six or
eight hour class at a cool building in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver with, uh, there were very few
people in that class, but it was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she taught us in great detail about
pesticides, pesticide handling,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, pesticide application, pesticide
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She taught us a great class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am what is called train the trainer
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to commercial grows and the state
of Colorado and I can teach them how to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can train other people to train the
staff how to be pesticide compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that is my credential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trained the trainer certified,
which means I can train other trainers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the grow and I trained the lead
grower and he teaches the staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I just do a big meeting, teach the
whole class all at one time, teach up the
whole class.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole, uh, the whole gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my credentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a little bit of training with
pesticides, pesticide application,
[SPEAKER_00]: handling and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just talking out of my ass on this
episode of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your best judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right, where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to just freestyle because it feels
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get in a good flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The notes make me feel too robotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, spray properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to spray the top, the bottom,
uh, runoff or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next part is soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our pests, uh, live on the leaves
and hang out in the plants, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them retreat to the soil, uh, for safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can shake the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can disrupt things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go hide down in the dirt because
a lot of things can't get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those pests, that's when I would
recommend what is known as a soil dredge
[SPEAKER_00]: or a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many great products you can use
to get rid of many common pests in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commonly, you're going to find,
uh, fungus gnats in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find root aphids in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all easy to defeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a root drench, a root drench or a
spray, any kind of pesticide treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be done on a good solid schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't have any issues, I spray every
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see one sign of issues, we spray
every Monday and every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see something in the soil,
we'll do a soil drench on Monday and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do another soil drench on the next
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel like there's still an issue,
we'll hit the soil again on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with those sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're spraying up top and we're soaking
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to attack from all
angles with multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a soil dredge is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never be afraid to soil dredge those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a soil born insect,
something like a fungus net, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like a root aphid, uh,
really easy product to soil drench with is
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe 15 to 30 mils of evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to steer you wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came out really naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 15 to 30 millimeter milliliters of
evergreen per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nice soil dredge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off with the 15, see if that helps
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to kind of react,
uh, soil dredge till you get some runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: that should help get rid of your bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do research and make sure I
said the right numbers when I edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we got a soil dredge for soil born
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're hitting the soil and you're
hitting the foliage and the plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: room is right, you're definitely going to
be on the right path to getting rid of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs, but keep in mind, if you're using
predators, we can't go spraying some
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't spray most things and we
definitely can't use most of these soil
[SPEAKER_00]: dredges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will destroy your predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be some strategy to
work on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part to all of this is
to have a routine and a plan and a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just go in there on Monday and
spray and think I got rid of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You killed the live bugs or you killed the
eggs, but the opposite is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a small population that you
missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I spray every Monday and every
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see any issues, get in there Monday
with one or two pesticides, then get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there on Thursday with one or two
different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go back Monday with one of the
products I used on Monday, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: products I used on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on Thursday I'll use the other two
products and we'll just keep rotating,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe add some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just keep rotating, maybe add a
product, maybe take a product out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really do try to attack those bugs
with all fucking options.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important part is to have
boundaries and ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray shit late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray the wrong things in flower at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray shit that you would not admit
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wouldn't write it down and say,
Hey, I sprayed 30 millimeters of this
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying millimeters for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not proud of it, if you wouldn't
admit it, if you wouldn't smoke it with
[SPEAKER_00]: me, don't fucking spray it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really the ethics of all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wouldn't smoke it, please don't
spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wouldn't tell us about it and be
honest about it, just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, and you got to feel
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you spray some shit on your
plants and you sell it to me or give it to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, you're like, bro, thank you for
the lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you give me an ounce of weed and I
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I started going, man,
my lungs feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like two weeks later, I'm like,
my lung is all burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a week later, I'm like,
I got out of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lung is fucking on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four weeks later, like I had to pull
my right lung out because I had got some
[SPEAKER_00]: disease from a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, that could have been
from the shit that I sold him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like imagine how you're going to feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anybody to feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use some ethics when it comes to the
pesticides and things you were spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: onto your plants, any sort of foliar
product, anything you're feeding your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, anything you're doing should be
treated with all of that sort of ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would Rasta Jeff do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that as you're doing shit in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a new merch product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to go over these
notes real quick and then we may start
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen, chuckers, beneficial insect users
[SPEAKER_00]: and pesticide spray applicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening to
another episode of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to stress that the most
important part of this is that you read
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottles and use all of the personal
protective equipment and do understand
[SPEAKER_00]: those reentry intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should add.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mention on the reentry interval
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products are meant to be sprayed
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those products, the reentry
interval written on those bottles is for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add two to four hours if you were in an
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but they're used
to having wind and sun to break down those
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that in your indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would add two to four hours to your
reentry interval for your sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that is all I've got
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I hope you did learn a lot from
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this inspired a lot of questions,
corrections, comments, and concerns.
