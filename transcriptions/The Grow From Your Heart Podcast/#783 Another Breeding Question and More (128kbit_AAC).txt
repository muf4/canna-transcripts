[SPEAKER_01]: Once again I want to send a big thank you
to everybody who did participate and
[SPEAKER_01]: indulge and imbibe and partake in the
iREDirect holiday set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, that sale was a great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not have happened without you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to everybody who did
participate in the holiday sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had a great safe new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the holiday you chose to celebrate
was great for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not concerned with which holiday you
celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope you did celebrate one with
your friends, your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully some good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you got to smoke something good
with somebody strange, maybe a weird
[SPEAKER_01]: cousin or an uncle you never smoked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that smoke a joint before a walk
kind of thing with a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you got to participate in some of
that action and have a good holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a wonderful holiday but when I got
home from my holiday shenanigans I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: my grow space and I stepped in a small
puddle of water that was not supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right I had a drain back up in the
area where my grow is and there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of water in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've spent a couple of days getting
some water out, doing some cleanup,
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling up some carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still have a little bit of stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast may be a little bit shorter
than you're used to because there is more
[SPEAKER_01]: work to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get some shit out of there,
get some shit cleaned up, get myself nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and dirty and get back in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is not the most important part
we're talking about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if you've got a plan,
if you've got a strategy, what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: risks of shit going wrong near your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: My grow, there was a flood and the water
got one inch from plants and the other way
[SPEAKER_01]: it got inches from a drum set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could have been much more disastrous
than it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did cause a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did cause a big mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that really really fucked
up was my schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to throw away some carpets and
some small items and details but most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff will be recovered and repaired.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really messed up my week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's messing up my timing and my flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the podcast will be a little
shorter here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you have a strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if there's a water leak in your grow
space or where you are growing or near
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that water make it to your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you prepared for something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that floor drain been maintained?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you prepared for any sort of disaster
in the grow like water has been kicking my
[SPEAKER_01]: ass the past couple of days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you prepared for water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course there's the opposite side
of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you prepared for fire?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just my quick heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check on your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure all your drains are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure no water is coming up anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure nothing's leaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure there's no sparks, no loose
wires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do a quick inspection here at
the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend John told me out of sight,
out of mind and that's kind of how I felt
[SPEAKER_01]: about the plumbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how we felt about the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a problem until it was a fucking
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily it didn't destroy anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything too expensive, too crazy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it definitely slowed me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough talking about a flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know if you are prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do if you get a
flood?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have something lined up?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the flood does come, can you get the
people down in your area to work on it
[SPEAKER_01]: without getting yourself in trouble?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're not in a legal place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a legal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only got a few legal plants in that
area where I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plumber, the drain guy, everybody was
able to go in there and they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, quit fucking looking
at them just because they're over there in
[SPEAKER_01]: an area and they're cool and they can see
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're in a place where you can't
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you quickly hide that grow if some
shit does go wrong in your, it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: home, your rental space, whatever you're
doing, where you got that grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you conceal that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you need to take some quick action?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my question to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's on my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some ruined shoes and some wet
pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has not been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to more fun stuff in this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, my friend, Mobius, Mobius,
I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got nothing but love and respect for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've become really good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the couple of years, I simply
disagree with the comment that you made on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still good friends, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still smoke a fat joint with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a really good topic of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend, Mobius, left a comment on a
YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a video about selecting males and
reversals for breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about just that, how I select
male plants and how I select which plants
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to reverse for my personal
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, Mobius, he chimed in with his
comment and I fully respect this opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think this is great podcast
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is totally something we should
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk about for a long time on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I got nothing but love and
respect for my dude, Mobius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get this twisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I think another great thing to
think about is if you are breeding to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: rec and med to reckon med growers and be a
seed company, don't get too stuck on what
[SPEAKER_01]: you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of touched on this before,
but we're going to elaborate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, instead, try to make a diverse
menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think flavors and effects have fruit,
have gas, have garlic, have mint,
[SPEAKER_01]: have earth, but also have soaring highs
along with pile driver heavy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottom line is be diverse, not only
thinking about rec market, but medical
[SPEAKER_01]: market as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very good feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that, but I also disagree with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respectfully disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, as the person making the
seeds, I don't think about the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational or the medical market at all
when I'm making a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selfishly, I'm thinking about what I like
in cannabis when I'm making a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will sound egotistical, but if you
took Van Gogh and told Van Gogh,
[SPEAKER_01]: make some art that the people will like,
the people aren't going to like the art
[SPEAKER_01]: that Van Gogh makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you shut the fuck up and leave Van
Gogh alone and let Van Gogh paint,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit's going to come out amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that I'm an artist or a
painter or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I breed what I like and it just
happens that I like plants with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: turf profiles and certain buzz types and
certain growth structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants also are desirable to the
general public, the people that want to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow my followers, my fans, my supporters,
the ivory army, the people that want to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow ivory genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys happen to like those because I'm
growing it with passion, with love for
[SPEAKER_01]: what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple of ways I like to describe
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an artist called Mattis Yahoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came up a couple of years ago in the
early 2000s, 2005 ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude was hot, hot shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: His first album, first two albums were
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could tell that he had spent his
entire life putting those two albums
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was everything he had to put that
together was all of his creativity from
[SPEAKER_01]: when he'd started writing up to the time
when those albums were put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was everything he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those albums are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of my most favorite albums shake off
the dust arise and of course live at
[SPEAKER_01]: stubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be more stuff before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the two when he got popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like his life's work right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what really got him going.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went on tour, he got super known,
he got super famous, he was killing it
[SPEAKER_01]: because his art came from his heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was his connection with his music,
what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't do it for anybody but himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, the record label came and
said, Hey, bro, it's time for that second
[SPEAKER_01]: record, you got to put some shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what that record kind of bites a
dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That second record, no offense,
modest Yahoo, you know what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, brother, that next record just was
not what we expected what we had hoped
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded bubblegummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded way overproduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded like a record company took over
and demanded a record on a timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of my point to that is I'm not
doing records for a record company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making records for myself and I'm
making sounds that I think sound good and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making turps and strains and crosses
that I think sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way that I like to think about it
is I'm a musician, I can read right I can
[SPEAKER_01]: play any kind of music.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of things I talk about,
I go back to music and that it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: relatable for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a musician, I can, like I said a
moment ago, I can read music, I can write
[SPEAKER_01]: music, I have a deep understanding of the
way music works, not just I'm the drummer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not just in the drums, I understand
the way the time works, the way the
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics work, I've been on stage,
I know how to make the singer sound good
[SPEAKER_01]: by playing a certain way, I know how to
make the bass player sound better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to make the beat feel a little
faster, even though it isn't just by
[SPEAKER_01]: playing in front of or behind the beat
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a deep understanding of music,
I can play any kind of music that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: me to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to play funky music, I like to get
down and funky, of course I love to play
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae music, I love to jam and get
improvisational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all sounds really good, but if you made
me play country, it would sound okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wouldn't sound like country music
from the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't have that country music,
it would be country music, but it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be country music.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for country music, you need something
right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want it to sound country music,
you gotta have some, I don't have country
[SPEAKER_01]: in my heart at all, I'm not a country boy,
I'm a fucking city boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dreadlocks and I wear sneakers and
shit, I don't got no boots or a hat,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't have that country feel,
I could play the blues because I've had
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking blues before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, if you told me to put out a
country album, it would be terrible
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't care, it's not gonna have
any heart, any soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm doing is, maybe it's selfish
of me, but I'm breeding for what I really
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have access to a lot of plants,
you guys know that I've worked in
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facilities, I've got friends
that grow, I've got friends that breed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in groves all the time helping people
out, looking at things, inspecting,
[SPEAKER_01]: investigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I see a plant and I go,
what's that one, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll tell me, they'll go,
that's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, I'm gonna need a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll go, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell them, you owe me this much
money for coming here today, instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: paying me, I want a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll go, okay, because people would
definitely rather give you a plant than
[SPEAKER_01]: money most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of cool cuts and shit and
people send me and give me and share with
[SPEAKER_01]: me really cool cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I'll just see something and
I'll be like, that girl right there needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be pollinated by either like the Jack
the Ripper mail or the BC lemon skunk mail
[SPEAKER_01]: or possibly King Solomon, everybody's
gonna get pollinated by Solomon before the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of this, it'll be Solomon to everybody
before the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just see the plants and I go,
man, that one right there and that one
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, just giving me modeling clay or
sculpting clay or I don't know shit about
[SPEAKER_01]: sculpting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a bad example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like giving me a big thing of
paints and a paintbrush and a fresh canvas
[SPEAKER_01]: and just letting me go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you told me breed this, I'd go,
I don't, I don't know if I want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why am I doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to like, smoke a plant or look at a
plant or be in the room with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant will say, hey, hey,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this is fucking crazy,
but I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant goes, you should definitely
bring me to the Jack the Ripper mail,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, huh, I should probably breed
this strawberry starburst plant to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack the Ripper mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, it's fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mobius, I do like your idea of having
the diversity first catalog and keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: medical and recreational markets in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that's another thing we could
fucking talk on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is not that is not my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that would work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think me sticking with doing what I like
has been working pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be I wouldn't be growing from
my heart breeding with love, which is my
[SPEAKER_01]: motto.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be that would that's one step
too close to breeding with my wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not thinking about my wallet and my
pocket book and shit when I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I like the fact that you said
keep the patients, the medical and the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational users in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I see that, I'm gonna go
right back to music.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've used this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mobius is in I know my dude Mobius,
you listen to heavier music than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to fish and reggae and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got Mobius into fish because
Trey is a fucking maniac.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we listen to different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I describe it is some people
want to listen to reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to listen to reggae,
that's irie genetic seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to correlate music to seed
brands, if you want to listen to reggae,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fucking I'm that is me right over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to listen to I don't even have
other breeders to compare to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have not gone down that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do some gangster rap shit,
we all know that masonic is the dude for
[SPEAKER_01]: the Compton gangster rap kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's what you want, what I'm
saying is, if you want to diversify the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, instead of expecting one breeder to
offer everything, that's when you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to different breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know that if I want like some
cushy stuff that I could go to DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, and those guys have all that
cushy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want a Wilson cross, I'm definitely
going to go talk to masonic smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want some jelly bean stuff,
I'm going to go talk to my friend Miss
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want some some of that grandpa's
cookies or ethos cookies, I got to go talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to my dude Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want heavy duty fruity, which is in
the garden right now and bangs out,
[SPEAKER_01]: I go talk to Adam done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is th seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just got to instead of having one
expecting one breeder to diversify the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I recommend and I know you're
doing this Mobius, you've got seeds from a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of different breeders, and you kill it
with all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps you have a variety,
a little bit of difference in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've got four or five,
three or four or four or five different
[SPEAKER_01]: males and reversals that I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm still limited to how many things I
can produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take my male plan or my reverse plan,
and I hit it to 10 or 12 different ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's what I've got to offer for
this season or this section of my took up
[SPEAKER_01]: that much breeding time until I do more
breeding or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can offer you so much but the other
breeders they've got totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: shit than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can definitely diversify your
portfolio a little more widely,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not breeding with the same
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, I love your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also love that I disagree and we're
still going to be fucking good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you said, what do you say he
said, think about flavors and effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro flavors and effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love good turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love to get straight up high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he said have fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I offer fruit, I definitely offer fruit,
fruit from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strawberry, strawberry, starburst,
lemon, Jeffrey, all kinds of fruity shit
[SPEAKER_01]: in my lineup, orange, gasm, sun kiss,
it's all got fruit in the name of it
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas, the machine is gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The machine is definitely gassy garlic,
garlic goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Hollow has the garlic in it mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mel Franks Durban poison crosses if
you guys have been following along,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that I've gotten access to a
bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mel Franks Durban poison is what the M
F D P stands for that is Mel Franks Durban
[SPEAKER_01]: poison that's got the mint in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The which ones got the earth, the moon
tower has definitely got the earth in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a lot of those covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soaring highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my stuff has got that soaring high
the jack the ripper crosses, they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: soaring high the rise crosses,
the pile driver heavy stuff that is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of where I'm lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm working toward that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that's not my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny, I went through a weird
shift in the weed that I like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess when I was younger, I just wanted
to get baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so hyper and so fucking rambunctious
that I just wanted to get baked and sit
[SPEAKER_01]: down just fucking give me enough fucking
heavy heavy weed enough indica to just
[SPEAKER_01]: make me fucking normal just just chill me
out just a little fucking bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I got older, I started working
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I can't smoke all this indica
I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I started smoking more sativa started
owning businesses and fucking doing
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoke a big dab of some
indica that puts you down on a podcast and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just sitting here like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good podcast, you got to be
fucking sativa out and be talkative and
[SPEAKER_01]: have the brain going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I shifted into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now in the wintertime, I feel like
I've been going too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some time with the lady time with
the dogs time on the couch just chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I know that my lady is looking
at me like you're just going way too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I need like a big dab of
some chilled out indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am kind of working toward that indica
sort of cushy sort of stuff in the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people are doing it, I want to do
it uniquely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a great strategy for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like I'm offering most of the
things you asked for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, don't be afraid to branch out
and have more breeders in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to lock it in with just
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people try to do all I re
all I reruns in their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't be afraid to grow other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mobius my dude, that was a fucking great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me rambling for at least 10
minutes on that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to hanging out smoking with
you sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a couple of states away from
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I do have another message here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from the the grow help tab
on i read genetics calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to i read genetics calm,
there's a tab that says grow help you can
[SPEAKER_01]: click on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will give you the opportunity to
ask me a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will print that out and read it here on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick update.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tab was broken for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you sent me some grow help questions
and you feel like I ignored you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did and it wasn't on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucking grow help tab had a major
malfunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some website updates and that did
not get corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with the updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the web guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there was a short time it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of shit that goes on when we
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it is corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've sent your grow help questions
and you feel like you got ignored,
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit was broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my best to get it on the show as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they want their name said
it doesn't say that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point do signs of nutrient
deficiency become fall colors?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good also kind of a
confusing question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how you could confuse some
nutrient deficiencies and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: colors that the plants make at the end as
it does what is called senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will turn into those fall colors when
you start flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no nutrients left in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will make beautiful fall colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point do nutrient deficiency
become fall colors?
[SPEAKER_01]: That depends on if you're flushing or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's kind of the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants won't make fall colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will make fall colors and some will
show you those colors because of a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my answer to this is mostly going
to be this is plant and strain specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the morning dew, if you let it
go long enough, it'll start making orange
[SPEAKER_01]: and goldish color leaves, but that always
happens during the flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's during the flushing phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fall colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything will start turning
yellow and pale if you don't feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should know what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fall colors are going to be
phenotypical expression and vary by plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the only way to really
determine that would be to grow the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you do get those weird colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you can identify what that color
could be caused by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't correct that, that's probably
just the plant expressing its funky end of
[SPEAKER_01]: life beautiful fall color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is more to this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, also, how do you breed a strain
to finish faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it as simple as crossing it with a
faster finishing strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have some blueberry now that
finishes in 53 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of your info and your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really helps, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a blueberry that finishes
completely done in 53 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer plants that go a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you get, usually, get more herb
and more potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that thing's finished in 53 days
and satisfies you, that is a phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a lucky dude to have found that in
a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you my address for a clone of
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, how do you breed a
strain to finish faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he says, is it as simple as crossing
it with a faster finishing strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that easy, but it's also not that
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on what you plan to do
with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the first batch is going to be a
little bit unstable, is the word that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find phenotypical
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that variation, we will find
different finishing times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a trait that gets passed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would do, I would find the
female that you like, but you want to slow
[SPEAKER_01]: or speed up her flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take her from 70 to 60 or
maybe even down to 50 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not be able to do this in the
first batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on if you want to breed
these seeds for yourself just to play
[SPEAKER_01]: with, or if you have some intention of
putting these seeds out to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find a good female plant that you
want to use as your female candidate,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find a male plant that flowers
more quickly than that female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find a drastic difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a female that goes 70 days,
you're trying to chop it down to 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd find a male plant that finishes around
that 55 day mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you got the ratio in there right
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere you'll get that early finishing
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's going to happen, or what most
likely is going to happen, these are
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and this is nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't drawn a Punnett square or a
Mendel chart to actually figure this out
[SPEAKER_01]: completely perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so you take that long finishing female
and that short finishing male and you
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now 33% of those seeds are going to be
shorter finishing phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 33% of those seeds are going to be longer
finishing phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other 33 have the potential to be
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we breed like this, we kind of unlock
Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F1s are going to be wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're breeding this just for
yourself, you do have the potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: find that early finishing phenotype in the
F1 generation that you are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are selling these seeds and you're
going to tell people that they finish
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly, the F1 generation will not be
stable or reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will need to make an F2, F3,
possibly even an F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first time you do it, find that
fast finishing male, pollinate your longer
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing female, and you've got a batch
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find what you're looking for for
yourself in that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do find earlier finishing
phenotypes in that batch, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage you to use those either for back
crossing or for further filial generations
[SPEAKER_01]: to even further reduce the flowering time
of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say that in a little bit more clear
terms, because I know that was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy mumbo jumbo for some of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made this first cross,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We took our long finishing girl,
our short finishing male, we made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of that, I expect that hopefully we
find at least one quick finishing girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we're going to find one quick
finishing boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got F1 boy and F1 girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put them together and pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now made an F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, let's find that quickest
finishing female and quickest finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: male and breed those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're making F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: These F3s are going to start getting a
little bit more uniform or they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be completely wild, depending on the
selections which we have made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to focus again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to find that quick finishing
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to find the super quickest
finishing phenotypes we can out of the boy
[SPEAKER_01]: and the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to breed them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, we've really started
locking in that super fast finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from here out should be closer
to the goal amount of finishing days that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking for for the phenotypes,
which we have to select from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably started with that female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said started at 70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F1 generation you found one that
finished it like what 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bred those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we found more that finished at what
58 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we found some that finished at 55 and
then we kept working with those and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're all the way to the F5
generation and we've got reliable plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that finish in 55 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take you several generations to
get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable homogenous seeds or
stable is the word we like to use in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, but you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it or you could just do it the simple
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross it one time and hope to find what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have the potential to shorten that
flowering time every filial generation if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do proper selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another hint, another tip of what I would
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do parallel breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk about this a lot on the show,
but I have mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're focusing on faster finishing lines
for the first part of this question we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got one that finishes in 53 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go any shorter than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would breed that to other things and
try to make that other shit shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would reverse it and breed it to some 70
day stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would reverse the 53 day
finisher, take the pollen from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on a 70 day finisher and see if I
can reduce that flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me get back into the main topic of
what I'm saying here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breeding on this line for flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep directing that breeding towards
shorter flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from the same batch of seeds that F1
batch of seeds you make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you took the 70 day plant and the 55
day male or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pollinated them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that short finishing one of the
male and the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our, we're going to call that
the fast line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the other side, let's focus on
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not only do I want that plant to
finish quickly, but I also need it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: highly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to breed a whole nother
project in another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to breed just for potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care how long these plants take to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what they taste like,
what they look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to find a male and a female
out of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find the most highly potent,
or I'm going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find the best looking,
most potent female I can and the most
[SPEAKER_01]: potent looking male that I can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hard one to discern there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But find the best female, the best dude
and breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to grow out those seeds,
the F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, find the most potent female
and the most potent male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go F3, F4, F5, doing the same
thing solely focused on potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I get to F5 or F6, I'm going to
take my fast finishing version of this
[SPEAKER_01]: line and my highly potent version of this
line and I'm going to breed those
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I make my own true F1 line
that is fast finishing and highly potent
[SPEAKER_01]: and also has the other traits you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I want to do these two lines
separately is because it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're breeding for specifically that
finishing time, stick with that fast
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that to a F4, F5, then find a male out
of that and use that male to pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: other ladies to make that fast finishing
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then on the other line, I would focus
on the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of focusing on potency and
flowering time, just use two different
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's say that that tall,
longer finishing plant is Strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: Fields and that shorter finishing plant
that I want to use for my male is Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not a quick finisher and not a quick
flowering plant, but we're going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that for the sake of this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I took that Arise and I
pollinate these Strawberry Fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes Strawberry Starburst seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's say that I want to focus on
breeding one for quicker finishing and
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on one for that super potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would breed Strawberry Starburst A,
the A line, straight up for that quicker
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would breed the Strawberry
Starburst B line for the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was doing it, if I let the
seeds out to market or if I shared them,
[SPEAKER_01]: sold them, passed them out in any way,
I would clearly label them Strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: Starburst F1A line or Strawberry Starburst
A line F1, B line F2, B line F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that they are labeled and
then those seeds will be great seeds on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still going to be potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have all the other traits
you're looking for, but I'm specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for one thing in my plan and my
strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I get that one to where I know
that they flower in 55 days and when I get
[SPEAKER_01]: this one where I know that the potency is
off the charts, I'm going to use that
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker flowering male, hit that super
potent female, and hopefully I can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 day finisher that blows your fucking
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that made sense because yes,
it can be that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be as easy as pollinating a female
plant with a quicker finishing male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it can be that easy, but if you want
to sell those seeds, if you want to put
[SPEAKER_01]: them to market, if you really want to
continue that project, there is more work
[SPEAKER_01]: to done and that is breeding them to
different filial generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to focus on speed,
I would breed that B line to focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: potency, breed them together at some point
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that message came from our
friend Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, that did come from the grow
help tab on the website.
