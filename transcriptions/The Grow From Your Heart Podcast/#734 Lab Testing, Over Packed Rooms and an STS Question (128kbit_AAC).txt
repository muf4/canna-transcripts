[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the information you need will be
right there on the screen and you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: do include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it super
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends to support the

[SPEAKER_00]: order more stuff having boxes with like
three and four t-shirts in it taking up a
[SPEAKER_00]: space is annoying we're going to replenish
and refresh if you've been looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes if you've got new ideas stay tuned

[SPEAKER_00]: one-man show so i'm a little bit
overloaded with stuff like that i've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of great merch ideas if you have more
ideas send them to me grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: at hotmail.com i love merch ideas shout
out to everybody has sent me the great
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas i will get them rolling it is coming
it's just me try to stay more focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds doing podcasts and stuff like
that anyway let's move forward thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys for all of the merchandise sales and
support i do appreciate that the next
[SPEAKER_00]: thing i do need to give a big shout out to
is the secret discord what there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: rasta jeff secret stash discord that i'm
not supposed to talk about so i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna we're gonna move forward in this
episode we're gonna cover a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: emails and i've got a few great messages
right here on the table let's jump right
[SPEAKER_00]: into it the first one here came from my
buddy alabama man what's up you bad
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucker hope you're doing well this
message goes a lot like this it says rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: jeff here's one for the show what is a
private grower to do when all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing labs on google require strict
adherence to state laws grower ids and
[SPEAKER_00]: such are there any labs you're aware of
that accept private samples for testing
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately in the state of colorado
right now we are not allowed to have our
[SPEAKER_00]: personal private grows tested to the best
of my knowledge all of the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities have to be regulated by the
colorado marijuana enforcement division
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a reason for that a lot of people
don't like the rules and reasons and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations but let me explain why this
rule is in place for a facility to possess
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of cannabis which may be
delivered to a testing facility at any one
[SPEAKER_00]: given time they would go over their legal
limits in the state of colorado without
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of special licensing without
some sort of possession limit so if we all
[SPEAKER_00]: just took it maybe take one gram maybe two
grams of your batch if we all took two
[SPEAKER_00]: grams or a gram to this testing lab
they're going to have at least ounces
[SPEAKER_00]: probably pounds maybe multiple pounds of
product on site at one time which does
[SPEAKER_00]: make them over the limit for their regular
possession of cannabis in colorado we're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to have two ounces in our
possession 28 grams times two is 56 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to put them over their limit
really quickly if they get good clientele
[SPEAKER_00]: good customers they can't have anything in
storage they can't have a backlog so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't bring it in give it to them they
can't test it also there's no legal
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer opportunity there they have to
have a way to receive the product from the
[SPEAKER_00]: person giving it to them then they have to
receive it away it's got to be documented
[SPEAKER_00]: so to avoid any sort of weird legal
complications illegal transfer illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: possession they did decide to regulate
those facilities by the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement division which means only
facilities which are regulated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana enforcement division are allowed
to use those facilities so the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grows are the only ones that can use those
here in the state of colorado to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of my knowledge there may be little
private pop-up shops that are doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: there are not advertising heavily i don't
know where they are wink wink but they may
[SPEAKER_00]: be secretly available that is the state of
colorado in newer states i'm not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: sure um the way that testing is working
there one thing i do have two
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations that i can recommend for
you one is they are now offering at-home
[SPEAKER_00]: testing devices i do not work for any of
those companies there's one company that's
[SPEAKER_00]: named after a color if you would like to
send me a sample of your sample of your
[SPEAKER_00]: thc testing device i would love to play
with that i would do a solid review on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show if you want me to buy it for a half
price or a advertising price let's reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out and talk to each other it's a little
expensive for a toy that i wouldn't use
[SPEAKER_00]: very much but if they sent it to me i
would definitely talk about it on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise the shit out of it it is named
after a color and it is a testing device
[SPEAKER_00]: that will test your thc content at home i
have a couple of friends who say it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very reliable device now here's what you
can do with it i wouldn't rely on it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: as reliable as a lab and i'm going to talk
more let's talk about that right now the
[SPEAKER_00]: labs aren't 100 reliable in my opinion
anyway i know how to skew a lab test i've
[SPEAKER_00]: sent one sample two samples to a lab and
have had two totally different tests i've
[SPEAKER_00]: had the same sample sent to two labs and
had totally different tests the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing is not 100 accurate at this time
yet anyway so the at-home lab testing may
[SPEAKER_00]: be just as good you could pay one price
for this device i do believe it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: 1500 but once you've got it you can test
all your products the testing gets
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive if you test a lot anyway so you
can get this one tester at home and test
[SPEAKER_00]: with that it may not be 100 accurate is
where i was headed but it will give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: range if you were a breeder and you are
pheno hunting or if you're a grower that
[SPEAKER_00]: is pheno hunting you're trying to find
that phenotype that produces the most thc
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll still know which one produced the
most one will say 17 one will say 18 one
[SPEAKER_00]: will say 19 if that machine isn't 100
accurate we still know which one is low
[SPEAKER_00]: medium and highest that will be a good
place to start and then test a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: products with that then send those same
products to labs and see how close that
[SPEAKER_00]: testing comes back compare them once again
if you run a thc testing company that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a an at-home product let's talk
because i would love to have one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show i'd love to play with that i'm
talking to you if your company is the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of a color all right so the at-home
testing in colorado the first thing i
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend is get yourself an at-home
testing device the one named after a color
[SPEAKER_00]: is the one i recommend nobody pays me to
say that i've got friends that have used
[SPEAKER_00]: it they say it's a great product the next
way that you could do this in colorado um
[SPEAKER_00]: allegedly i've heard of people doing this
i can't tell you to do this i can't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that you do this i
[SPEAKER_00]: may get in trouble for that so i'm going
to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it tested maybe possibly i've heard of
people taking their home-grown cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: there that they knew was going to be super
high testing in thc and zero cbd and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just turn it in and you say here's my hemp
sample can you give me a report and they
[SPEAKER_00]: call you back and they go they don't
really say this but they kind of say this
[SPEAKER_00]: they go you motherfucker you knew this was
going to be a test test test test test
[SPEAKER_00]: test test test you knew this was going to
be 32 thc and zero cbd this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifying as cbd as hemp what are you
going to do and they go oh thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab report thank you a lot and they
pay it and they have a fucking thc report
[SPEAKER_00]: that says 32 percent that is a shady
shifty way to do it but it's all too
[SPEAKER_00]: common here in colorado because that is
what we've got to do if a home grower does
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get their product tested in a
reliable safe effective way and not buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: home testing device all right i think i
wrapped that one up um with all the strict
[SPEAKER_00]: adherence to laws yeah um you're going to
have to either find a lab testing place
[SPEAKER_00]: that will test a home grower stuff buy
yourself a home testing device or be shady
[SPEAKER_00]: and send it through a hemp testing
facility another way you could do it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have some friends that run a
commercial grow maybe you can sneak your
[SPEAKER_00]: sample in with their sample batch and
they'll let you get away with that but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's illegal i can't recommend that i
couldn't tell you that you do that but
[SPEAKER_00]: i've heard of people allegedly possibly
doing that keep in mind rasta jeff is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fictional character anything we say here
is all for entertainment purposes let's
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward i do have another email here
in front of me this one says a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: like this it says yo rasta jeff i hope all
is well i have a grow question for you
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy that is my department of expertise
it says if i reversed a female it has
[SPEAKER_00]: hella pollen sacks but no pollen could it
be from too strong of an sts solution yes
[SPEAKER_00]: it absolutely could it could be from too
strong it could be too weak it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough spray it could be too many
sprays there are so many variables that
[SPEAKER_00]: can contribute to the sts not working
that's why when i do an sts spray i always
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend spraying multiple clones of the
same cultivar that you want to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen of that way you've got different
applications will produce different
[SPEAKER_00]: results i'll hit one plant with 90 one
with 80 one with 70 if i've got more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants i'll spray one more often i'll
spray one less i'll just do different shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that way i know that something is going to
work and i write down what i did to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: a b and c and i write down what worked and
i remember that for the next time i grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that cultivar and i do intend to reverse
it let me read more of the message here
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make sure i don't skip anything it
says i started with a 50 mil part a and b
[SPEAKER_00]: to 400 distilled water spraying five days
sprayed every three days oh i see the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem you only put let's see 50 mils
parts a and b that may work if you used
[SPEAKER_00]: the right dilutions of the right amounts
of products a and b your half a gram and
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a half grams you make them in the
distilled water started spraying five days
[SPEAKER_00]: before flipping sprayed every three days
the last spray was on day 20 what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend i also want to try to reverse
this exact same strain so i don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just move on until i'm sure she won't
reverse oh this is just the first try when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to reversing plants do not ever
expect that first attempt to be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: successful that is sometimes that works
but some plants are very picky it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say what plant you are using some plants
are very picky some plants will reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: will reverse very easily what i would
recommend is mix up a fresh batch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate a brand new fresh batch
cut three clones of the same plant spray
[SPEAKER_00]: one at 90 one at 80 one at 70 percent
dilution and see what happens then spray
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days before flip then flip then
spray day one then you understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern spray on the day one when you flip
and then spray up to about day 24 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see what happens maybe one of those
will spit out the pollen for you if not i
[SPEAKER_00]: do have other recommendations we may have
to spend a little bit more money we may
[SPEAKER_00]: have to step up our game but we do have
other options let's try different
[SPEAKER_00]: dilutions and see if a little stronger
dilution or a little lighter dilution will
[SPEAKER_00]: work possibly if you can do more plants
let's spray one of them more frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of them less frequently let's
experiment a little you've only got one
[SPEAKER_00]: sample so this isn't scientific this is
all so many variables so many anomalies
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is only one test testing sample
let's do the test again let's control it
[SPEAKER_00]: let's take a lot of notes and see what we
get from don't give up you are absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: correct you say you don't want to just
move on do not give up let's try the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plant multiple ways you know that that one
way didn't work let's see if we can get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to work a couple of other different ways
so if you're out there trying to reverse a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and it didn't work the first time
don't get discouraged i hope you took a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of notes i hope you're ready to try
again i hope you didn't have those girl
[SPEAKER_00]: plants all ready to go already and you've
got female plants in the room that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get pollinated i hope we can try
again don't get discouraged put science
[SPEAKER_00]: into it put some passion into it that is
why fem seeds are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive you guys we got to do a lot of
work to make that stuff work all right my
[SPEAKER_00]: dude uh who did this come from there is no
name on this message you know who you are
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great question i hope
the sts works maybe watch that episode one
[SPEAKER_00]: more time make sure you're mixing properly
then spray three plants see how that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got further questions reach out
because you know i would love to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out all right i do have one more message
in front of me that i'd like to read it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not that one that i picked up right
there um we're gonna read this one all
[SPEAKER_00]: right after some shuffling i found the
message that i do want to read this one
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the grow help tab on the ire
genetics website that's right if you visit
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics.com iregenetics.com
iregenetics.com there is a grow help tab
[SPEAKER_00]: if you click on that grow help tab it will
ask you a few preliminary questions we ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you what strains you're growing if you're
growing indoors or outdoors what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you're using just basic things like
that to give me an idea of how to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: then at the bottom it says explain the
problem we let you explain your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: problem just a few details on this one
we're growing multiple strains which
[SPEAKER_00]: include hood candy 91 chemtobubba there's
a couple of cool crosses in here we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing under leds the plants are in
flower it says they're in week 19 that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be week 19 overall because if
you're flowering for 19 weeks you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking savage it goes on it says it's in
cocoa it got fed jacks um the temp is
[SPEAKER_00]: right the humidity is cool then it says
the problem um hey there rasta jeff i used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a patreon member we're not going to
read all that we're going to so basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the issue i've been running into is
powdery mildew toward the end of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a common issue and i do know why
based on the photos that came with this
[SPEAKER_00]: message it says i'm at my wits end with
how to correct this my last one is about
[SPEAKER_00]: six weeks in i had a pm flare up so i knew
i needed to change things up as well as do
[SPEAKER_00]: a super deep clean i need to clean every
fan blade and corner of my room so this
[SPEAKER_00]: run and veg i stepped up my ipm with a
rotating schedule of def guard and dr
[SPEAKER_00]: zimes with a final application of myco
stop the day that i flipped as well as i
[SPEAKER_00]: added a 16 inch oscillating fan in my
little four by four all right so you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stuff going on in that four by four
a lot of preventative sprays however a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those preventative sprays don't stick
around long enough you're spraying at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of veg then you've got that nine week
flowering cycle about six weeks the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: get chunky we get a lot of activity from
the leaves a lot of water moving around in
[SPEAKER_00]: that small space then guess what ding ding
powdery mildew pops up it goes on it says
[SPEAKER_00]: i added a second fan on the floor trying
to create a cyclone effect uh below the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy to push any stagnant air up that is
a good idea and then it goes on it says so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're about to start week three last night
i spotted two leaves with very small spots
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery mildew on them i'm at my wits
end and i'm not sure what else i can do
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll admit i have some fluctuations in my
rhn temp never more than 10 points yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 10 points that 10 points could
be doing it especially with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that i see in this room we're going
to talk about it says i'm about to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: super heavy defoliation and i'm hoping
that i'll be able to finish this run out
[SPEAKER_00]: but i fear the worst i'd love to hear your
sop for powdery mildew i think you've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard uh you mentioned cease before but
why i would love your thoughts on this all
[SPEAKER_00]: right i've got pictures of this room and
the first thing that i noticed is that
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants are way too close together
there are too many plants in there and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is too leafy our dude minds eye open said
they were going to do going to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and do a heavy defoliation that
should have been happening much sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: with as many plants as you've got in there
as much foliage as you've got in there you
[SPEAKER_00]: are lucky that it took you this long to
get powdery mildew there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity happening in the room there are a
lot of leaves touching there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces where there are micro climates in
there there's a lot of moisture there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of micro climates perfect warmth in
that room you're always going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew unless you spread those
plants apart give them some room to
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe and do a an extremely heavy
defoliation in that room it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliated very heavily i would go in
there on day one of flower and take a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaves off then when they grow back i
would go in in week three then i'd go in a
[SPEAKER_00]: week six and then right before flower i
would strip them just about now right
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest i would strip them just
about naked you've got a lot of leaves in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room i wouldn't have half as many
leaves in that room as i excuse me as i
[SPEAKER_00]: see on these plants so one of the first
things to do would be a heavy heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation i'd go in there and just take
off all of the leaves that you don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: are necessary i did a defoliation episode
recently give that a listen anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: a hint of powdery mildew get rid of it
then take all of those leaves get them far
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow the trash the dump the
landfill whatever get rid of them then
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up yourself clean up your scissors
clean up everything real well now if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about integrated pests
management to help get rid of that powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew the first thing we need to do is
correct the plants too much leaf the
[SPEAKER_00]: second thing we need to do is correct the
airflow you may have a lot of moving air
[SPEAKER_00]: but are you getting rid of the the
stagnant air that old sweaty air is that
[SPEAKER_00]: going out somewhere are you evacuating
that exhausting that somewhere are you
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling in fresh air somehow that may help
you out also let's get a lot of random
[SPEAKER_00]: movement going on in those plants a fan is
going to move the air one way all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: let's put another fan in there to make
that air mix you've got one on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: let's mix the air as often as possible get
a lot of air exchange air mixing new air
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air no stagnant pockets in there i
think defoliating will really help your
[SPEAKER_00]: fans be effective right now the fans
aren't working past that first layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants every plant that is behind plant
number one is not getting wind there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much leaf and so much foliage you can't
feel the wind through the forest is what i
[SPEAKER_00]: think i'm trying to actually say so
defoliate ah adjust the airflow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room adjust the air exchange in the room
that will also help you correct the vpd
[SPEAKER_00]: the vapor pressure deficit the relative
humidity and the temperature will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: easily controllable by having less leaves
because the leaves will be putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: less water you'll have less humidity in
the room it will help you i'd also save
[SPEAKER_00]: you on some watering time you'll be able
to water less frequently because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have as many leaves in there to keep wet
then if you really want to talk about more
[SPEAKER_00]: of an integrated pest management strategy
to get rid of the the powdery mildew there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a few products that i do like you did
say that you know i mentioned cease ceases
[SPEAKER_00]: a great product i do like to spray that
one i also like a couple of products
[SPEAKER_00]: called b52 and double nickel those are
also great products for taking care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew also sometimes if it gets
real bad i wouldn't be uncommon for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit those plants with h202 a very very low
dilution of h202 or hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to say that the hydrogen
peroxide and h202 are the exact same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: however they are not there are other
products added into that h202 if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing it would not be labeled
h202 i think it would just say hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide there's other stuff in that
bottle so i've been corrected on that
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's a different thing the 30
hydrogen peroxide and the h202 product are
[SPEAKER_00]: different things there's also zero tall
zero tall does have other stuff in there
[SPEAKER_00]: those are all three similar but different
products that will work very well for the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew that will dissolve the
powdery mildew dilute it very low spray it
[SPEAKER_00]: directly onto the plant wash it watch it
wash and eat that powdery mildew right off
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants all right so those are
properly be careful read the freaking
