[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we covered all the chatter at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that I talk too long at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some business to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have sponsors and things like that
that do help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give shout outs to my friends
from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being patient,
getting through the first 30 seconds of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into some of the main topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of great emails here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, big thanks to all the
people that message me on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from my friend,
Mark, and it says, I've got a question for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: After revegging a flowering clone and
transplanting soon thereafter,
[SPEAKER_00]: what week of the vegetation phase are we
now in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a plant that went into flower,
then you reveged it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now revegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could cut a clone from that revegging
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that clone going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now a fresh plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real question that you are asking is
what week of the vegetation phase are we
[SPEAKER_00]: now in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, technically, I don't really
count veg weeks that critically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can decide when you took it out of the
cloner and put it into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say that that is officially day
one of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a real solid day of marking
day one of veg, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time for veg is kind of arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you counting?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's big enough, put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason we keep a good track of
what day it is in flower is because we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know how many days we typically
flower this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will cut it down on that schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: For veg, it's not hypercritical to know
what day, what week we are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you really need a day, like I said,
so you're going to cut the clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a revegging plant,
then you're going to cut a good shoot off
[SPEAKER_00]: of that revegging plant that will go into
a clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when it comes out of the clone
dome into that cup or that first pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what I would call small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beginning of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now the start of what I would say
is veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it goes into a bigger pot,
that obviously would be what I maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, that is what I would obviously
to myself call large veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a small veg and a large veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go into flower from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said before, it's not
hypercritical to really have a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that of veg, as long as you know,
that when it gets this big, I should
[SPEAKER_00]: flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of more of what I would pay
attention to that that day of when to
[SPEAKER_00]: start the vegetation phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really need that you can invent a
day that suits your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go go from when it goes into the
first initial cup or pot when it hits
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, I guess, or cocoa or hydro,
however you're doing it when it goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: your main system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really no hard and fast rule
on that because you can just veg as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, I'm really
repeating myself at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason we keep good notes and
flower of what day and what week we are in
[SPEAKER_00]: is because we know that at the end of week
nine or at the end of week 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can harvest these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little more critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also appreciate the continued Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Mark,
you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you look forward to hearing
from you in the future because we do
[SPEAKER_00]: correspond a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad the I read genetics Rasta
Jeff and grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee mugs landed safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep moving
because I feel like I've got a good flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nicely stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a good flow going no need to slow
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend be balla
shout out to be balla.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also been corresponding with be balla
quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fun interacting with the
community more now that the outdoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: is settled and some things have caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things do get a little bit slower around
here during the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be online more you'll be getting
more correspondence and interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here goes the rambling shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get me focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have purchased a bunch of your
regular seeds, almost everything that is
[SPEAKER_00]: available in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for that and much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been asking if they
can get iri seeds in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on the seed vendor tab,
there is a Canadian flag that Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the magic ticket right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that one that will get you a
Canadian vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, the dude that is
the dudes world that will get you going in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my Canadian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes on to say, I know you were
saying something about running them in
[SPEAKER_00]: small pots and flipping them quickly to
find a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering if you could talk a
little more into detail about that because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is something I would like to do with
all of the regular seeds I just got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been throwing down pretty good on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been buying a lot of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually sent you like a hoodie
or something because I remember seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you for all that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am running a new crop, let's just
say, so recently, you guys know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you don't know, we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along with the
show, you know that I just did an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made some seeds and a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the seeds I made in that breeding
run have never been made before,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I need to test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see what I've produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unlikely that I've produced a bunch
of garbage, but it is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have made mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have made intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have made a bunch of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have made a bunch of trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have made things that don't fit the
program for what I'm looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but may be good for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I need to find out what I've
made is the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quickest and most efficient way to
do that would be to grow a bunch of small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I want to run these plants in three
gallon pots and put nine of them under a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt light and waste a bunch of
space and waste a bunch of time vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: them when I can put them into very small
pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy a bag of 50 solo cups from the local
store down the street, and I've got 50
[SPEAKER_00]: pots to put plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me a minute to stab holes in them
with some scissors because I do need some
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage, but I can get a bunch of pots
for a very affordable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 beer cups is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're done, if the plant isn't
any good, you could just toss that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't feel like you're wasting a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can do small pots, but I don't
really need to grow large plants to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get these plants going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll germinate a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put that seed into the beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or into maybe a one gallon pot at the
biggest, and then I'll get it going in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll veg it until it is maybe six inches
tall, maybe eight inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of just depends on what I'm going
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is something that I think I'm going
to keep, I will veg it until it is just
[SPEAKER_00]: large enough to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that top node, that center branch
creates a big enough shoot to get a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: from, I'll cut that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I am confident that that clone
is going to root, I will flip my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to get it any bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being the breeder, I've got plenty of
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to see what I've created at
this point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds came out of the greenhouse
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what we've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find out what they are,
find out if they're, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants, intersex plants, pure trash,
or maybe they're fucking magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to find that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to grow them as quickly as
possible and discover what I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get them going in a small pot,
veg them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the clones because I've got a
lot more seeds and that's not my goal
[SPEAKER_00]: right now anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just get them growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as they're, sometimes
I'll do it four inches, five inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even just six inches tall,
then I'll flip them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working in a commercial
environment and I could have basically
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited plants, I would run,
I have these little trays and those trays
[SPEAKER_00]: can fit 24 cups per tray and I could fit
two of those trays comfortably under a 600
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do, I would start 50 seeds and
then by the time I was done pulling the
[SPEAKER_00]: males or whatever, I'd have one solid
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'd use the two trays and spread
them out, but I'd have one solid tray
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of females that I could grow out and
see what I've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that worked really well under that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I would just grow them right and
start taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't manipulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything to them because I simply
want to see what these plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may grow them under different
conditions, different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may trellis them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may scrog them out later in the future
in different runs once they make the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I don't know what these
plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste more than a few
weeks, more than a few square feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a few kilowatts, more than a few
cups of dirt on plants that I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if they could be complete garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put them in the cups, put them in
a small pot, veg them out, flip them,
[SPEAKER_00]: then start taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of, lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have rows, plant A, or sometimes I do
weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I kind of code it based on what I'm
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a rise, I would say a rise F3
number, and then it would just be numbered
[SPEAKER_00]: down the row one through 12 or one through
25 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would make a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rise number, a rise F3 number 22 really
looks crazy good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 36 is going to be a male at a super
tall I could tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep notes and then react to how
they get fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed everything exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat everything exactly the same and then
see what these plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for number one thing is
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send out problematic seeds
to customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to ruin a business,
ruin friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just shitty to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about making quality shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure that we're not
finding any problems is the first thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they germinate well is my first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they germinate well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they germ, how do they react once I
put them into dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they sprout up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they damp off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have any weird problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look for mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they do any weird shit as they grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for growth anomalies, different
ploidial features, different leaf shapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: different what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they are they limpy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they wimpy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they wispy is the word I'm trying to
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just weak plants in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they grow like fucking crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to show me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes and a lot of pictures,
start snapping those pictures around week
[SPEAKER_00]: three, all the way up until harvest,
get a good catalog of photos of every
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that you find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you've got a bunch of good stuff,
you know, I know I've got good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can send it out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to do this to kind of find
your keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend growing them maybe in a
one gallon pot and get them as big as
[SPEAKER_00]: until you can get a clone off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, cut that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see that clone,
take root, then flip your plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that way you've got a clone going for
backup and you've got a plant going
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify the males about 10 to 12
days away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify the males, pull the male
plants out of there unless you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are not looking for a boy
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the dudes out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also go to your clone dome or your cloning
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all the dudes out of there as well,
because you know that plant number 32 and
[SPEAKER_00]: clone number 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're just narrowing it down to the
awesome females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you get done removing all the
males and sexing all these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably by day 14, hopefully by day 17,
you've gotten all the dudes out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're looking for is stellar
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got clones of everybody,
so when you start seeing girls that really
[SPEAKER_00]: stand out, maybe there's one with an
amazing growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the one that's got the traits you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're after,
but when you see that, start taking notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like this one's gonna finish way
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant 13, the one that I thought would be
unlucky, that's supposed to be the unlucky
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, that one's gonna finish early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a note in your notebook over here and
hope that clone number 13 is rooted well.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time you have got your clones out
of your clone dome or clone machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you do it, you've got them into
the small cups and they're now vegging to
[SPEAKER_00]: be your next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you finish this first crop
over here, these have been up potted and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got another run to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to grow all the females one
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones of your favorite two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will probably be two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be one that you really like as
the grower and one that a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people like as the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize that that one that they
love was a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a bunch of it and you're gonna
be like, I don't want to grow that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: again because it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be one that you really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick the one that you really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me make sure I cover that because I
didn't have any notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just freestyled that because I
think I'm good at talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, run them in small pots, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just run them small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a clone as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how good you are at cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you can get a clone off of that
plant, snip a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see roots on that clone and
you are confident you've got a survivor,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower those other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the boys as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the big plant and the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them out of there immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a lot of good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide which one you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat all of them exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you gonna know which one is good
if you treated one differently than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that you gave the other microbes
to is going to come out better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them, cure them, harvest them all the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to, I don't know,
this is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I cut down all of the plants at
the end of week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I kind of keep an eye on them
and I let some go a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that cheating testing or is that doing
what needs to be done to each phenotype to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize its potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, either decide, do we whack
them all at the end of week nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of week 10, or do you pay
attention to the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of depends on if you're a
commercial grower, like in a big facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to be done by the end of week
10, hopefully week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, they're coming down by week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to cut them and see what they
do at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a personal grower that can
manage, they can go as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in charge of that time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe let them go and see what they do if
you let them go to week 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like to let new shit go until
day 70, at least 70 days, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at the end that last week,
if you cut it down to day 63, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 65, 67 plants really go
shebang, kaboom, and really beef up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to let them go 70 days that
first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to your preferences,
your garden, what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've already made a determination by
day 55 that that is not the plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want, have no fear to cut it down and
get rid of it early if that's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do, or finish it, dry it,
cure it, smoke it, and enjoy it as usable
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only going to be, now,
here's something I've got to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: These first test runs are not meant to be
big time cash crop, pay the bills,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rich runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are test runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are auditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are selector runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are phenohunts is what these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking for the keeper in the pack
that works the best with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of describe it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that there is something in that
pack of seeds that is desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You read the description on the website,
and you scroll through a bunch of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you decided on this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pack of seeds that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ordered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's going to be something in
that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are going to be close to what
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've just got to find the one that
is in there that is really good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've agreed on Italian food, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us can agree on Italian food or
Mexican food, but today we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've agreed on Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten to the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we're that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed pack came.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you get the phenotypes,
that is the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the marinara?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the Alfredo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the eggplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the scratchy throat,
but we've agreed that we want the Italian
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pack of seeds that you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to open up the menu and see
which menu item is perfect for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are going to be your phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get the dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start with dessert, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I hope you heard my stomach rumble
as I was rambling about food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not hungry until I said Italian
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mouth and stomach just totally growled
into this microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I explained that well because
really run them quick, run them small so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't waste a lot of time,
space, and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, this is not a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an audition crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to find the keeper out of
this pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next couple of runs, we're going
to establish a relationship with the
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper in that seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find the perfect plant for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, pick two because it's
always two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, a lot of the times,
it's plants number two and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I don't know why it works out that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, four, and nine are always the champs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I number them one through 12,
or there's a lot of times 12 seeds in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack or whatever, I'll do 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through one, two, four, and nine are
quite often the fucking champions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to find two or three that
you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them again because you've got those
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you keep cutting clones every
time you put them into flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to cut a clone,
put them into flour, cut clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into flour, keep those clones so
you've always got a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But run them until you find the one that
you really, really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is going to be your production
crop, the one that supplies your medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: pays your bills, whatever your goal is,
you've got to find the perfect one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's work to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't realize or don't
want to do that early work to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're going to jump in and
have a cash crop and have profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: product the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that, but ideally, you would do
an audition process, find the first one,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're going to put this
keeper outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run it indoors through the winter
and then have a clone ready in the
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime to put out there so you know
what's going to do the best outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one with the good structure to
hold up from the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that puts out a bunch of good
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that's not intersex or a male
so you don't put an intersex or a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant outdoors and fuck up the whole
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an audition process and it can
happen very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to waste lights,
electricity, time, space, energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, real estate, numbers, a lot of us
are limited on plant count numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've noticed that my breeding projects
have slowed down because I am very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: on plant count numbers here in the state
of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, for a little while,
they let us just fucking put plants
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you could cram them into the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to the doctor and say,
my back hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need 50 plants for my back hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just say, my arm hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd write you another 30 plants for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd write you all kinds of
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then allegedly you have 125 plant
count, which I would never go over 100
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's when you get in huge
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, we'd have 99 plants
in some rooms at some houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm limited to 12, which most of
the time ends up as 11 because I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant that after he does his work
around day 25, he gets cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of wasting a fucking plant
count with that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an empty space half the time just
because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my ramble, the point is that
numbers are big so you can cut down plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't need early and save on
numbers because here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my six medical cannabis plants
because I have a medical cannabis card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get my six adult use plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're limited to 12 per household,
per resident, per person, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's why my breeding is slowed
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys used to see me put out a lot more
shit until they changed the rules on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then COVID really slowed me down
because I'm not doing the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: contracting and consulting, which I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I would trade commercial
consulting for space in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, well, I need to test run a
thousand seeds in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll come consult for your grow
while that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be a good trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not doing that now because COVID kind
of put everybody on a skeleton crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skim this message and make
sure I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them small because we don't want to
waste space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a clone, flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you like it before you grow a big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this will re-loop me around to a
podcast episode I did about outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you won't be that person putting
gigantic plants outdoors that you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: late in the season that you've been
vegging this nine foot tall fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good way to prevent that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them small, turn them, burn them,
get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect that first crop to be a cash
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will pay yourself back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll pay for your electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll pay for all your bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll pay for the seeds over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be the last crop
you'll ever grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first crop you're going to
grow from these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to build a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to grow this plant like
a fucking champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you found the keeper,
pop another pack of seeds until you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a room full of keepers that max out your
mother plant space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Used To Be
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear from Used To Be Cool quite
frequently on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy, Used To Be Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you're messaging us and you're
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must still be cool in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to the point because I'm
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one rambling and stumbling through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not our friend Used To Be Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read this very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Can spider mites be removed with
a shop vac or other vacuum?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about trying it, but I was
afraid it might remove the mites along
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I had one Arise plant which was
least affected of all of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for any insight you can provide
from your friend Used To Be Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part about that is that the
Arise plant didn't get attacked by the
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in there told those mites,
I don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise stood in the corner, not getting
eaten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else was getting a feast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shop vac for spider mites or any other
type of vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can use a shop vac for spider
mites, but think about when you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: shop vac running, there's that exhaust
coming out of the other side, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have proper filtration,
are you just shooting those spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: down the hall?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would use a shop vac in a commercial
grow to just clean up the floor and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I could see that exhaust shooting
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, anything that's
coming out of that vacuum is just going
[SPEAKER_00]: down the hall to all of the other grow
rooms right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the leaves just rustling from
that exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you shooting spider mites just all
over the place now from one section to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my first thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got proper filtration,
which it's got to be a small, tiny filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very tiny micron filter to catch a
spider mite, you can definitely use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: positivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it to suck off webs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it to remove the webs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the shop vac to remove the
spider webs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your spider mites have gotten out of
control and you've got little little tents
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, you can get up there and just
put the shop vac or a regular vacuum right
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suck those webs right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use a rubber glove and a paper towel
and just wipe the rest of that shit off of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do some damage to the
trichomes, but it's better than having a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of spider mites on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question about removing foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just depends on how hard you've got
the flow be turned up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that thing's really sucking and you've
got a powerful vacuum with a smaller hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may suck off some of the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may do some leaf damage, but that
foliage is where the spider mites are
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out and living anyway,
so you may be killing two birds with one
[SPEAKER_00]: stone and doing two jobs at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're defoliating and getting rid of the
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I have done with
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had whiteflies in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow was at a point where I couldn't
treat it with any sprayed pesticides or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, so I got my normal
house vacuum and I put the long wand
[SPEAKER_00]: attachment on the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the shop vac on and I had a long
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just smack the plants with the
vacuum attachment and then use a stick to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep annoying the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they flew out, I just fucking shot
vacuum off the light because they all went
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to the light to shot vacuum right
off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as they would land, I just rattled
the plants again and just go shot vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: or vacuum up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be effective, but keep in mind
that they have to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not getting caught in a
canister or a vacuum bag or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they getting shot out of the back of
the vacuum?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of vac you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just something I would really
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does blow exhaust out of a lot of
vacuums, like a lot of shop vacs have an
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part about ruining your plants,
if you got mites that bad, get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what it does, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vacuum is not going to be much worse
than what those mites are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that answers this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do this, get rid of the contents of
that vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a bag, a canister, maybe take the
whole shop vac out to the woods and light
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that thing's filled with
fucking problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can burn it, like seriously,
if you've got a fire pit, burn that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thing because those bugs are going
to scatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever they go, that place now has a
spider mite infestation, like level 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're just in a little bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breeding in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're partying in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are boys and girls in there and now
there are babies in there and those babies
[SPEAKER_00]: are having babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites reproduce quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you do, get rid of that
canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do keep in mind that that vacuum is now
filled with problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever happens to that vacuum,
the canister, the vacuum bag, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you are very responsible and proactive
with what you do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't spread those problems to our
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get rid of them in your
grow and then just take them across town
[SPEAKER_00]: to another place and cause a problem there
or across the yard, across the lawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: across the whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spread those spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may just come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just put them in the trash can
outside, they'll find their way back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not today, but they're going to go
to the bushes outside, then to your shoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: then right back into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get rid of them as far as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jokingly said burn it with fire,
but if that's an option, burn it with
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend used to be cool for a great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that shop vac if that is what you've
got to do, but make sure you get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: all those mites and mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like carcasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also works great for aphids,
white flies, uh, fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do this with, if you've got an
abundance of bugs and bug mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, bug webs, this would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I really hope you got to it
before it got to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important part is that you learn why
it got that bad and learn to never let it
[SPEAKER_00]: get that bad again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you get one, one pass at getting it
that destructively bad, but next time
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to make fun of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you got to think about what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a scolding from Rasta Jeff,
a polite, gentle scolding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get one pass next time you're doing
pushups in the ivory army.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do a big dab and then try to do
10 pushups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's punishment or
pleasure to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to wrap up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
