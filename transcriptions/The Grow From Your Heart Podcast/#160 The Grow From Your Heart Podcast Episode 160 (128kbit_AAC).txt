[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I'm going to get to the point of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a purpose today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the season, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is harvest time in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of California is probably working
through their harvest, but I got an email
[SPEAKER_00]: from a listener and he asked us,
oh, this phone is trying to make me update
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to update.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the worst timing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iPhone wants me to update to the new
operating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, happy croptober.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, happy croptober.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to skip his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, my name is blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'm a long time listener and
have used so much of your information here
[SPEAKER_00]: legally in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you repost your curing episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured tis the season and I'm sure
people could use a curing refresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely going to give you a curing
refresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to repost the old episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that'd be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go ahead and redo a
fresh episode on how to cure your freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that though, there is a
second half to this email that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just written to me that I don't think
needs to be read on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll respond to the email personally,
but on the air, let me say that I am glad
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could be there to help you when
things are rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly appreciate the email like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry for your troubles,
but I'm glad that I could be there to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you out the little bit that I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend asked us to do a drawing and
curing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat's already clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I could use a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for one
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sip on some frosty cold Dr.
Pepper, and I'm going to take a fad dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we're going to do a
quick lesson on drying and curing your
[SPEAKER_00]: freshly harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am freshly
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am freshly hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about drying and curing your
freshly harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to something that is super
important that I know I talk about a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I find it to be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 14, 10 to 14 days before you plan on
harvesting your plants, flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watering your plants anyway,
or they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about two weeks before harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't predict it that well,
10 days is cool, but try to go 10 full
[SPEAKER_00]: days at minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather go 10 to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 is what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in cocoa, 10 days is plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in some soil, soilless mix,
you're going to want to go 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you got to do the first day that
you decide to flush, just fill that pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with, get some, if you really want to pH
the water, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a small crop, pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using a large crop,
like I run seven gallon pots, so it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of water to flush my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pH all of that water to be honest
with you, to tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, just fill up your reservoir
and water your plant heavily, a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where you're getting a little extra
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got saucers underneath your
plants, water it until there's runoff in
[SPEAKER_00]: those saucers, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some extra, more than usual,
because you're trying to wash that dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next 10 to 14 days,
don't feed it anything but clean water,
[SPEAKER_00]: just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to pH it, go ahead,
but just give it water, clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean those plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make your plants burn
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to smoke better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ashes will be nice and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your joints will burn more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever gone to the dispensary and
bought weed and you grind it up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grinder and you start smoking it and your
ashes burn and they're kind of black and
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint doesn't burn right and it tastes
a little funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because that cannabis was probably
not flushed properly and it still got
[SPEAKER_00]: funky shit in it that you don't really
want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could have been a lot better had it
been flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also probably could have been better
had it been trimmed and cured,
[SPEAKER_00]: dried and cured properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so frustrating that people will
spend so long on plants and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't flush properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get 14 days of not having to spend
money on nutrients and it's just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get a little bit dry,
you'll see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the leaves start going, you could see
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water the shit out of them and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the next 14 days, let them water them,
dry them, water them, dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to get at least four
good flush cycles in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first day, the big heavy one on
the first day of the two week cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe Monday, Thursday, Monday and
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's four good waters that you can get
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to actually let the plants
dry out a little bit before I harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right before you harvest, just kind of
let them chill out, let them dry a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a few days before harvest,
maybe two or three days before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go in there and take off all of
the large leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves that are just going to end up
being thrown away or that are in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got a large petiole and I can
get to them and they don't have resin on
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I will cut those leaves off now
while the plants are standing and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and those leaves are sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut all those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes harvesting so much easier when
it comes down to cutting down the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and you don't have all those leaves
hanging in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already gotten rid of them and
you're just going to step ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself because harvest can get
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one light, if you've got
four lights, if you've got 10 lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will get overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with that one light, that one pound
of weed is going to take you, if it's your
[SPEAKER_00]: first harvest, you're going to be sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut off those extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to be in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to end up on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to be just fine
without those leaves for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of the growers that does the
extended dark period, like 24 or 48 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of darkness before harvest, chop all these
extra leaves off right before you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark phase and it will really increase
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what I'm talking about,
you guys, a lot of people, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and this is up to you and it's up
to your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more up to the plants you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain strains love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like blueberry and flow really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some silver haze varietal I tried it with
hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey doesn't seem to approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what a lot of people do, they will take
a plant and 24 to 48 hours before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will put it in total darkness and let
it sit in the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This puts the plant on panic mode and it
basically makes it finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of bulk up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start using the last of its energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you do if the sun didn't come
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would kind of freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's whole purpose in life is to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's goal is to get pollinated,
make seeds and die so that those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: fall on the ground and grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What its job is to do that is to swell up,
to get bigger so that it can receive more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I better get some pollen soon
because I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts swelling up and it starts
getting bigger and you'll get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more density and a little more resin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain how true the resin
production is, but I've seen more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it in there for like 36,
48 hours, you'll get a little production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more indica dominant strains will like
this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take off the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw in the dark if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that in a large cultivation
facility because we're running a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just always got the 12-12
happening because it's easier that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the 12-12 over the 11-13 that
we've talked about on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about running your lights on
11 on and 13 off because it does show a
[SPEAKER_00]: little better phenotypical expression in a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also save you, I guess if you're
running for 63 days, a nine week flower
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, that's 63 hours of lights that
you're going to save that you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay for electricity, cooling,
and also your gear doesn't get used that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to save that much mileage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do that, that works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want those in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants stay in the dark if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have little plants, you can chop
down the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have larger plants, it's probably
easier to cut it down in sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, I honestly use a coat hanger
and I will take a large plant and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: go from the top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start from the top and work my way
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do, I go from the top and I
usually try to cut off about maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between eight and 12 inch long
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take the top cola and I'll go down
to where I can find the first little
[SPEAKER_00]: branch of nodes that I think will support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cut below that to where I can use
that branching as its own hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut the bud and then it will hang
it upside down on the coat hanger that I
[SPEAKER_00]: plan to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hang that coat hanger somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a drying area that's got little
racks for a coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang it wherever works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the temperature and the
humidity here in just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cut your buds, you hang them on a
coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You continue to work your way down the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a couple of V's sticking
off and you'll start seeing these little
[SPEAKER_00]: V's intersections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just come naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down the plant, cut a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you chop one, hang it up, chop another
one, hang it up until you got your hanger
[SPEAKER_00]: full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave plenty of space on these hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only put, let's see, one, two,
three, four, maybe put like seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, maybe not a whole lot of stuff,
stuff together on these hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want air to be able to get between
your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they're going to dry properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put them on those hangers and hang them
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about where to hang the
plants and then we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: wet trimming and dry trimming because
that's what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ideally hang these plants in a
room that is approximately 65 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to have approximately 45 to
55% humidity in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a dehumidifier or you may
need a humidifier in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that you may need to
properly dry and cure this product to be
[SPEAKER_00]: top shelf, 100% grade A dried and cured
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, you need a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets so dry here so quickly that our
buds dry in like four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: People make fun of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call our dispensary weed the Colorado
crunch because it is crunchy by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets trimmed up by a trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets put in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets sent to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets put in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar gets open and closed all day,
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time it gets to you guys,
it is just super crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to prevent that is to dry it nice
and slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will retain some of that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll retain some of that stickiness and
it'll still be dense and flavorful and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll still burn properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want your drying area to be 65 to
75 degrees, 45 to 55% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need it dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light degrades trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light breaks down THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is not what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you would like to have a fan in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to leave that old air
sitting on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to at least move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can have a blower blowing air out
of the room and exchanging the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: having fresh air coming in and old air
going out, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we don't all have that type
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a closet or whatever,
make sure you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water that comes out of your buds is
water that will go into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just going to be trapped in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to raise the humidity in
your closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to come out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open that door occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more buds you have tucked in the
space, the more moisture there will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more water you fed the plants right
before harvest time, the more moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're getting rid of the
moisture in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a good idea, you guys, would be a
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put a carbon filter and a
blower in your drying area, it would
[SPEAKER_00]: really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would minimize the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would help keep you discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to make
concentrates out of their buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a carbon filter would also help you
keep dust and contaminants out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I see a lot of people do,
they actually use the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a hydro hut or a
small room, you can use that room as your
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and carrying space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should already have a blower in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should already have climate controls
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that have actually purchased
specific three by three or five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tents and they don't put a light in
it, but they do put the blower up top and
[SPEAKER_00]: they put a little fan in there and then
they just hang the plants upside down in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got one hut that's being
harvested all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a perpetual growth where like
every two or four weeks, one of their huts
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down and then it goes into that hut,
which is actually part of their flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into this other hut, which is
their drying hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those grow huts are good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a room that's very well
controlled if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that's not always possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we would talk about wet trimming
and dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've chopped on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it on these coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it hanging up in a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can decide, do I want to wet trim
this stuff or do I want to dry trim it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are benefits to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a hell of a mess and it takes a
long time to wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think wet trimming takes longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to do a little bit neater
of a trim, but in my opinion, I am better
[SPEAKER_00]: at a dry trim and I think it's more time
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wet trim, take those buds that are
hanging on the hanger, take them off the
[SPEAKER_00]: hanger, trim them up, leave them on the
hanger or leave them on the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut the buds off the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trim up all those leaves,
all those funky leaves that are sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: off, trim them real close to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they dry, it's going to look even
tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little tiny pieces you can't get to,
those will sink into the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it dries up, you won't be able to
tell they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them back on the hanger, hang them up
in your dry area and leave them there
[SPEAKER_00]: until the sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to do a dry trim,
those plants that you've cut down and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got them on the hanger,
just leave them in your drying area until
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the sticks snap, that's when we
catch up with your wet trim and dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep saying, when the sticks snap,
and I'm sure some people are saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your plants, they've been cut
down, they're hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've either been wet trimmed to where
now you've just got beautiful branches
[SPEAKER_00]: with beautiful buds hanging off of them,
hanging on a hanger in your climate
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled area or you've got these furry
looking plants with just the little leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: left on them because earlier at
pre-harvest, we cut off all the big
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got these plants and they've just
got little fuzzy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a haircut hanging off of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hanging up in your dry area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, every about 12 hours, I would
recommend go to those plants and pick a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch and just give it a bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at first, you're going to feel those
plants just bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to bend and it's going
to be real flexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, you'll notice that those
branches become a little more brittle and
[SPEAKER_00]: a little harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, those branches are going to
snap when you bend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thicker ones are going to take a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinner ones are going to go a little
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention, maybe check two or three
buds every time you check when it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much at the beginning,
but once you get closer, start paying more
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to this different size buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you feel those stems pop,
once you bend it and it goes click or pop
[SPEAKER_00]: or crunch, you will know it when you feel
it the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, that's what he meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got trimmed buds that are
already trimmed, that's when it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop those buds off of the sticks and we'll
start the curing process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got buds that were going to be
dry trimmed, now is the time to dry trim
[SPEAKER_00]: those and we'll talk about that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your buds, they're hanging on
the hanger and they're a little bit furry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just take a branch off the hanger
and you can cut these buds off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks because they are about to go into
the curing bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about hanging
them up anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the buds pop, it is fine to take them
off the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your buds, the stems pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take those down and if it's easier
for you to trim it while it's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stick, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's easier for you to trim it after
you cut it off the stick, go for it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I am not your trim boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working for someone else,
you got to do it how they tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow their rules, especially if they're
paying you, especially if they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow their rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the leader of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to adjust to their shit,
but check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come to your house to help you
grow, you get to make the rules also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leader of the grow gets to make the
trim rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to make the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I have not mentioned,
almost this entire process, wear rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that at the beginning of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wear rubber gloves all the time when
you're in the garden, put on rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that shit in your hands and
the plants don't want your hands on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're wearing gloves and you cut
your buds and they're cut off the sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're on the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're fairly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either use scissors or I use my
thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I will take basically a stick
with buds on it and I will just take my
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb and kind of just twiddle my thumb
around these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make a little up and down motion
and I knock the leaves right off the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: without disturbing the bud too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll catch on to what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do it a couple of times,
just hold the bud almost like a video game
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm looking at my hands and use
your thumbs just to knock off the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find where the, the perfect angle
to use your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little thumbnail on my right hand
that I use so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use it even through a glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,
just, and the plants are fairly dry at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point and the leaves are already
crispy because they've been hanging up for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long that you're just going ahead and
knocking off those crispy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need scissors, get scissors and get
in there and cut off all those funky
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell what needs to come
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you just want clean looking buds
that aren't leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please trim your buds, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can save all, if you're wet
trimming or dry trimming, you can save all
[SPEAKER_00]: of your material and you can make
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, I cannot recommend anybody to make
their own BHO if they're not experienced,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you know somebody that is a
qualified expert in making butane honey
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, you can make some BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make bubble hash out of it,
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make edibles, that's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make some topicals,
if you want to put it in coconut oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do all of that with your trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your dry buds, your dry
trimming them with your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those are dry, once those are all
trimmed, I feel like the buds that we dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: a wet trimmed earlier that we just cut off
the sticks in the last part I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and these dry trimmed buds that we
just trimmed with our thumbs, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at the same point with those in the
same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our two characters have caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got, either way, you've got a
pile of beautifully trimmed, and maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go back and hand trim those other
buds that you did before also a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they've dried, you may notice
some stuff you missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go back and kind of clip
them up a little bit, get in there with
[SPEAKER_00]: some scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you got a pile of beautifully
trimmed, perfectly grown buds right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: just where the stick snapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where the curing process
actually begins, and I know we're 25
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes into the episode, but I wanted to
get you here properly because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get your black belt until you got all the
belts in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to talk about curing
this perfectly dried and trimmed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not referred to any notes in this
whole episode, and I am not going to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: up any notes to actually tell you this
part about why we want to cure our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's basically my understanding of why
curing slowly is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the main part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another reason to it also,
but mainly chlorophyll tastes like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is a part of your plants that
makes them green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get rid of as much chlorophyll
as we can from the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way that you can get rid of
chlorophyll, the only way it can evaporate
[SPEAKER_00]: is by evaporating with moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is the only way it can go away,
but it's got to break down before it can
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate with moisture, so it's got to
happen slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we try to cure slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing that happens is the
THC transfers from, or it changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it transforms from THC to THCA is my
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by dropping a water molecule,
which is what happens when the water
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly evaporates, it becomes much more
psychoactive and much more available to us
[SPEAKER_00]: when we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I said that wrong, I would love to
hear your correction because that is just
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is my little mental library of
science of why we cure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, the reason I cure cannabis is
because it makes it taste better,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes it burn better, and it gets me
higher, and it just makes it better
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want a basic reason or a science
reason, that is why we want to cure our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis properly and slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your flush phase done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your pre-harvest done where you
chopped off all those extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we either wet trimmed them or we cut
off all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're hanging up and they're
pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we dry trimmed them, which we let them
hang for a while and they looked ugly as
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the stems cracked but the
buds were not brittle, you still want
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds nice and moist so they're
fluffy and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's what we're aiming for,
fluffy and sticky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got those cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got these pile or this pile
of beautiful whatever you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this beautiful pile of lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems were popping beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get some glass jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want like either cur or ball glass
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the larger ones with the wide
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put, just gently drop the buds
into the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pack them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop buds into the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them sit on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up about 75 to 90% of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to stuff them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it only halfway full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it like 75 to 90% of the way
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to put the lid on that jar
and repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all your buds in jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep going until you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have a lot of jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get tired of filling jars
with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill all your jars with buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put those jars in a cool,
dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the same environment,
similar to the environment that we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in while they were drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're in a jar, but we still want
to keep them cool and dry and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still science happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep them dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm kind of weird and I have a lot of
time to dedicate to my buds and my
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will, this is adjustable,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go back about two hours later
and open that jar for just a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like maybe five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the air to move around in that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it fluff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I close it up and then I'll come
back about four hours later and do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before I go to bed, I will
actually dump out all of the buds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar and I will rearrange them and I'll
put them back in the jar and I'll leave
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar open for like a good, I don't
know, three or four or four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want, I want fresh air around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want anything that like any stagnant
spot where they'd been pressed together,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've been sweating on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give them some breathing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any mold to happen inside
that jar is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll crack it open at like two hours
and then four hours and then six hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll try to go to bed for a few
hours and ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first thing, you know,
I'm going to do when I wake up is go crack
[SPEAKER_00]: open those jars and smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first they're going to smell wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to smell like damp weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting like a hay smell or an
ammonia smell, you done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You left it closed for too long or you put
it in there too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it super wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's super wet, leave it open a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some of that water come out or open it
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want mold starting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open up the jar like I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four hours, six hours, eight hours,
12 hours, and then start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more it dries, the more slowly,
the more less frequently you can open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to be opening that jar once
or twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it burping the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to burp that jar once or twice
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after about five to seven days,
you're going to notice the buds are dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're still spongy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll squeeze them and they'll kind of
compress and then they'll fluff back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll break them open in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a little bit of moisture
still, but they'll smell real dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have a really good smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke it, it's going to burn
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lock them into that jar and leave it
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only open it once a day after the
first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're getting where they're
smokable, just leave them in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: only open that jar once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you take out,
if you think you're going to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to smoke seven grams of
weed a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out seven grams for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in your head stash jar and leave
the rest in the cure jar so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave it sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every day or other day,
go pull out how much you're going to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next couple of days and leave the
rest of that stuff in there to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want plenty of moisture in there,
but you don't want them too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're juicy, you don't want to put
them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're kind of, as soon as those
stems pop, you should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal that jar up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in a dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just increase your timeframe and
pay attention to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got multiple jars, experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open one up every four hours and see what
it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then leave a couple of them closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go too long with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever want to go, like right
away, I would say check them every four to
[SPEAKER_00]: six hours in the beginning and then
increase that time until you can go every
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be up to you to judge how
often your jars need to be open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to give you timeframes,
but I don't want you to mess up your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you have different
temperatures, if you have different
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity problems, if you leave it closed
too long, you may cause a mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every art, there's some trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to fuck up and try not to make
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best advice to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to mess up a little bit,
but don't mess up a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to mess up once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't learn how to ride that bike
really cool until you crashed a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times and then you learned what you could
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my quick crash course on how to
dry and cure your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like once your cannabis is properly
dried and cured, it can be stored for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I've had some weed for three
to six months before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stored weed for a year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep it in the proper conditions
and the proper environment, different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains will keep for different amount of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some stuff that I kept in a
refrigerator in the back for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a long time ago, I hid some
weed from myself in a freezer and I forgot
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and I found it when I moved out
of that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed tasted really terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it in the freezer did something
weird to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a little bit ago, I gave a
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a man with a whole bunch of
passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the show is called Grow From
Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I definitely need a
dab, so it's time to start wrapping up the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed my lesson on how to
cure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I wrap up the show, I want to send
my love to all of the people affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado wildfires and I also want to
send a huge thank you to all of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who helped put out those fires and also
all of the support involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Law enforcement, people that volunteered
bringing the firefighters, water and food,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that participated in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart goes out to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my heart goes out to all of the
people that lost their homes and their
[SPEAKER_00]: property and were affected by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, now that the show is
over, please go to iTunes.
