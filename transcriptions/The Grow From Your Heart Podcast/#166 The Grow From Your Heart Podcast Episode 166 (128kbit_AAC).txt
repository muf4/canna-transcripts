Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeffa,
and thank you guys again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to give a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band, flooding me with their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, congratulations on the little one
that's coming up soon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love in that family.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of positive folks in that
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm proud of Lindsay also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the table, she just mouthed the
entire intro perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've nailed it two or three times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, boo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I send you videos all the time of me
nailing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sent me a video of us face swapped
doing the video, and I almost had a
[SPEAKER_01]: nervous breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was creepy as fuck for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's do some introductions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, that lovely voice
you just heard to the left of me is the
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show, honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for driving all the way from
Colorado Springs to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, it's so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to have any tech issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: No tech issues this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not take any gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it at the home studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny brought an Easter basket filled
with Terps hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at the table got a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that are not at the table are going
to be here later got gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got green crack terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has got sleeping monkey hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some Panama punch on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some blue dream over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little conversation about the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted a sweet new pencil dabber
from our friend Tater Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a UV reactive that's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's UV reactive on one end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has got like a cobalt baby blue,
which is actually honestly one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know much about me, the tip has got
some blue in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also already got a little piece of
hair and the reclaim that stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how our lives are so hairy,
but that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Tater Glass and granny for
hooking me up with this sweet new pencil
[SPEAKER_01]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it's one of my favorite colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's similar to my daughter's eyes
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, that was one of my favorite
colors before she even was born.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I got to show you the UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny carries around a UV light,
you guys, so that if you've got UV
[SPEAKER_01]: reflective glass, it's a new reactive
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much a black light,
but you hold the rig underneath this
[SPEAKER_01]: little light granny's got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's got UV in there, illuminati
glass, it will glow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dope as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe she carries that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a literal Easter basket full of
treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's granny's basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny's basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out for coming all the way from
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in front of me is a lovely traveling
stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you you could be on the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over here, a quiet guy,
but he'll talk a couple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bobo Blaster Co., also known as Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_04]: The traveling stoner's better half,
the one that keeps her in line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to keep her in check somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys follow Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: on Instagram because he has started making
glass gnome carb caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to dabble in the glass game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, you are a hell of an artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a tattooist before I knew you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing art for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that art thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a lot of clay sculpting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So glass is kind of like second nature,
but it's really fun and really
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good at it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you excelling quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what everybody keeps telling me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little homie gnomies he's making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just started a glass account.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out gnome glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys follow him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he makes cool glass or little gnome
carb caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some cool ideas for him,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jump in now while he's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see him, see him get
better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, is that a Goba glass pendant you're
rocking there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that is dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goba?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I believe it's Goba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you Goba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's Goba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I didn't butcher his name right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a, he's worn a pendant that
actually has cannabis seeds inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's got a little bee on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're encapsulated little lemon
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one with a silver 99 seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have the drips or the stuff on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the straight up penny with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are nice little like pinata
pendants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like worst comes to worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it breaks, you have like a present
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh, it's bad luck, but like,
Oh, or it's a good end of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on a, if you're on a flight and
you crash and you're on an island,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you've got cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I land on a fucking deserted Island,
it's got some, a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_01]: nearby that I can take the salt out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got some soil that I can put some
salts into, but we can make this happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am never leaving the house without that
pendant again.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, if it's got a hole in it,
because I'm pretty sure it's got a hole in
[SPEAKER_01]: it because the way that he makes his
glass, don't wear it in the shower because
[SPEAKER_01]: your seeds will germinate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: For real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all that moisture, the humidity in
the shower, you'll get water in there
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just takes a little tiny bit of
water to germinate some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be a warm seed to actually
watch to see what it would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: See it somehow try to grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Joe, you got to send us another
one so that we can have a science project
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just get some seeds and put them in a
vial and poke a little hole in it and
[SPEAKER_01]: watch what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys today is cause for celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should all, I was going to say,
we should all take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is the dabbing granny's one year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it quite amazing that you have come
this far in one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many Instagram followers have you got?
[SPEAKER_08]: This morning it was 215,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you didn't hear the microphone
smack against my forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me do it a little harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 215,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes no sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an account with 19,000, it got
deleted and now I'm almost back to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would give myself credit for 25,000
followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a nice solid score.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got 10 times what I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not just, it's people from all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was doing the Periscope,
I did a gram dab for celebration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, watch me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the person came in from Russia
talking, you know, we're so glad Trump is
[SPEAKER_08]: the president.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if there would have been world
war, if Hillary, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I know your leader really felt that way
and okay, but I think it's amazing that
[SPEAKER_08]: people from Russia come to watch the
dabbing granny dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you took a gram dab at 420,
here it is 820 right now and you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: damn good shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been dabbing since about six o'clock
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw your video this morning when you
were talking about you were excited to
[SPEAKER_01]: come be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was early this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you replied to one of my
Instagram messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, she, this lady can dab you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She can keep up with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She can probably out dab you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She probably has more turps and better
turps than you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: She showed up with the gifts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can't beat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one year, are you on?
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube?
[SPEAKER_08]: I am on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a huge following on YouTube,
but I have a very loyal following that
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like granny's reality TV.
[SPEAKER_08]: They ask a lot of questions about my
family and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, they know that I've evolved and I
don't have an hour every morning to wake
[SPEAKER_08]: and bake.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I do a YouTube once a week,
they're, they're happy to have my little
[SPEAKER_08]: presence there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just find it incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can my listeners find you just by
searching for dabbing granny?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's dabbing on most of my social
medias are dabbing underscore granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm on YouTube, Periscope, Instagram,
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, you know, I'm liking Facebook again
and people are finding me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that live streaming and I like the
intimacy of Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Periscope, my room fills up pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Couple hundred people real quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook might be 10, 15 people and we can
have nice conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, the people on Facebook is
what I like better about the Facebook
[SPEAKER_01]: live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know more people on Periscope because
I've been doing it longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have Facebook friends on my
Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly people that I know personally
that I've hung out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go Facebook live, it's all my
bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a one year dab right there
happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at my friend, the traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a nice chunky dab there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's throwing a carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's hitting the sweet rig from our
friends at elevate glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to, to our friend,
Becca and everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody over at elevate glass,
all the lovely elevate dolls.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to share a secret about the
traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, yes, I'm going to, she's like,
Oh, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on my list of notes for breast cancer
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: The traveling stoner and I went and had
our nipples pierced.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably one of the most painful
things I've been through in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these lovely ladies went and got their
nipples pierced to raise awareness for
[SPEAKER_01]: breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that is some dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some bad-ass women.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is truly, I didn't do it for like,
Oh, let's go get a tattoo or a piercing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the way I thought about it because
I know some people that had breast cancer
[SPEAKER_08]: and I thought it's breast cancer awareness
month.
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody shared some stories with me
and I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have breast cancer and you're going
through chemotherapy, God dang,
[SPEAKER_08]: life probably sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every day is a battle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just having your mammogram done is an
uncomfortable experience for any woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go get your boobs squished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was like, come on, Lindsay,
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's a few minutes of pain compared to
someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they do it if you don't have a
boob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're lacking in the boob region,
what do they squish?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they go for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for mammograms, you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just took a weird turn on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, well, how do you,
I thought you were talking about for the
[SPEAKER_03]: piercing for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not through the boob, it's through
the nipple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was like, uh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just went right through the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was like, um, I don't know
what you think we did, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're higher than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did not mean it to throw you
off course that you were on a path.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't want to go get a tattoo or.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't want to get a tattoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, really I didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will share something personal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been married to my husband for over
40 years, almost 45.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know my husband very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew he would not approve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you would be like, Oh,
but wouldn't every man like their woman's
[SPEAKER_08]: nipples pierced?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, my husband is very conservative about
your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't tell him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knew I was hanging out with Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knew what was going on, but I did not
tell him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought if I tell him immediately,
he'll say, take them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I waited a few days and he knows how
bad a piercing hurts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is how I told him he was sitting
in his chair and I had fun band-aids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't I traveling stoner?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put on, I had little round sad face
emoji band-aids and this kind of graphic,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the round part fits over a woman's
areola perfectly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he was sitting in his chair and I
said, I have something to tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, Oh my God, I know you're not going
to like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, what did you do now?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I lifted my shirt and there was them
two sad faces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, you are not 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like those kids you're hanging out with
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, but it was to raise breast cancer
awareness.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I don't want to hear your
rationalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't like it, but yeah,
it does look kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a win-win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay wouldn't let me give her a hug for
like a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't let anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to sleep on the couch for a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every like, the dogs and like,
even the sheets would get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, too fast, too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other day I was putting on a onesie
really fast and I, I zipped it up and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chris was like, Oh, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: My German Shepherd jumped up on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a titty twister just when the left
one was almost healed and it was like 360.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were talking about Periscope and
stuff, I was going to talk, I was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: mention like, you put a lot of your life
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't you like, don't you want to keep
anything to yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't even need to ask that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: What have I really got to, you know,
secrets are bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means something dirty or,
or bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think anything I've done in my
life is really dirty or bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, everything's been a learning
experience and I'll share it with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully you'll learn if I,
I was young and dumb once I did some
[SPEAKER_08]: stupid things that young and dumb people
do dumb, not dumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I'll share that with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you'll learn from the things I
say, because I do have a lot of experience
[SPEAKER_08]: behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find, well being a podcaster and I also
used to put myself on Periscope a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't seem to be, I don't like sitting
down as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be on my feet doing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope makes me feel like I get anxious
for some reason afterward.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on how much you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I look up and it's been like 20,
20 to 30 minutes and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh shit, I only meant to spend five
minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time does get away quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But putting that much of myself out,
I I'm accountable for what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't fib at all because however many
listeners were listening, listened and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's on record and the pod every episode
is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've said before, I'm going to start
putting out old episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even have you learned that the power of
your words, you really sometimes have to
[SPEAKER_08]: stop and think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because people take things literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really lucky that I had a starter
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another friend that had kind of a
comedy slash community based podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys check out Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a podcast together and I kind of
got to be his cohost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to say a couple of dumb things on
episodes and realize, oh, I can't say that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, you have to figure it out,
but that's how I learned it was by fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was laughing when I said,
I'll try to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, the way I learn, I have to
fall and crash and I have to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: damn, that sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll try to learn from that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very accountable for the things I say
because so many people do watch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said something on your social
media this morning about when you become
[SPEAKER_01]: as known as you are, you, you,
you way more than myself, but everybody at
[SPEAKER_01]: this table has a little bit of notice,
but you've got 10 times what we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get to your level of insta
celebrity or insta fame.
[SPEAKER_08]: I called it insta famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slightly insta famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you've got to pay attention to what
you say and who you talk to and what you
[SPEAKER_08]: share and what you get caught up in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much easier to get caught up in
shit when you've got 250,000 people in
[SPEAKER_01]: your ear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in our cannabis community alone,
just in this small community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I catch myself in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I catch myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's choosing sides all the time in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like we're all just a bunch
of potheads having fun, but that's how it
[SPEAKER_08]: should be.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should all be united.
[SPEAKER_08]: There shouldn't be any backstabbing and I
don't have time for pettiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we're getting too old.
[SPEAKER_01]: These kids are too old for that shit too
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, I think all these young
people will learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get just cause Jeff, maybe you said
something shitty about Bobo blaster over
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Oh, that was me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny, you know, he's just a rotten
person.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm learning that some of these kids
will take what you said to heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobo blaster over there might be damn good
person, but you have a personal event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause some girl you liked, he liked her.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, she said bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm messing up his glass business and
taking money off of their table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just using you as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that Chris is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no beef ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless somebody's done me wrong,
you can, you can gossip and talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: somebody all you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rest assured granny is not going to listen
to your bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always old enough and wise enough to
make my own decisions about people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me earlier that you just trust
your gut and you're 90% of the time you're
[SPEAKER_01]: right as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gut usually is a pretty good judge of
what I shouldn't, shouldn't do with other
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Lindsay's the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secrets don't make friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, what's happening over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually passed me a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grab the email here and
I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of hash did you just give me
some terps or be some terpy slurpy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so these, these lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they called it terpy slurpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These lovely ladies, the dabbing granny
and the lovely traveling stoner here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came because they are going to do a
food drive slash new toy drive,
[SPEAKER_01]: new toys, you guys, new toys in packages
for kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you an age range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let these ladies handle it while I
take this stab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But would one of you ladies like to tell
me all about your food and toy drive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk for a while lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we have set up a food and toy
drive here in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far we have 17 different places as drop
offs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, at each of those locations,
you'll be able to get some sort of special
[SPEAKER_03]: like deal or offer something for bringing
in either a canned food, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_03]: a non-expired canned food or
non-perishable canned food, something y
[SPEAKER_08]: 'all would eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: No expired garbanzo beans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you like garbanzo beans,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or like Jeff said, a brand new toy in
a packaging, um, any age range,
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly, we don't, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a toy is a toy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not gonna, we're not gonna put a
limit on it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, if you bring in an item to
one of the, one of the places that we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: list off, um, you can get a, and each
place is doing something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you'll have to ask the specific
place what they're going to, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, do for it, but we will,
we'll have a flyer and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: For it that we'll be posting and stuff
with each place that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have 17 places right now confirmed,
and we have three spots open for places.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We decided to keep it at 20 cause we are
going to be the ones that will be going by
[SPEAKER_08]: the dispensaries, picking stuff up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have a warehouse to store things in
until we distribute them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we picked a good organization.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we, we wanted we wanted to
somehow keep it in the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_08]: but this year on such short notice,
that's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we have decided to do is I got
into contact with the Marion house and the
[SPEAKER_08]: Marion house is down on Bijou and they
feed and they clothe a lot of our homeless
[SPEAKER_08]: community.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that's a lot of veterans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also a lot of young people moving
here because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you see a lot of young people down
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I reached out to them,
they will be happy to take anything we
[SPEAKER_08]: have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then their second organization under
the Marion house is called the family
[SPEAKER_08]: resource center.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they deal with families that are
totally displaced homeless families that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're getting set up in apartments and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are why we're saying we'll take
toys because there's children involved in
[SPEAKER_08]: most of these cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why we decided, you know,
so many people think, Oh people that smoke
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, they're bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love giving back to our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to start small this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to do it in Colorado Springs,
but we're hoping to have a really big
[SPEAKER_03]: turnout this year and be able to make it
into something even bigger for next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether that means we stay in the Springs
and just make it bigger next year,
[SPEAKER_03]: or we, you know, try to do something even
bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we're really excited about this
and the different play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to list off the different
places that we have?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to throw one more thing in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we'd at first we were just going to
do, we, we had talked about money and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff and we decided no, but what we are
going to do all the different places that
[SPEAKER_08]: the 20 places we're going to put a gallon
mason jar there and you can drop off gift
[SPEAKER_08]: certificates because like I say,
the family resource center, um,
[SPEAKER_08]: say we get enough, a meal together,
we get everything for their, and this is
[SPEAKER_08]: for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get their Christmas meal together.
[SPEAKER_08]: What if they don't have a roasting pan?
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: The family resource center can sell it and
say, here, take this gift certificate,
[SPEAKER_08]: go get what else you need for,
or I think the other thing we might want
[SPEAKER_08]: to include is diapers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, diapers are really, really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we could expand, you know,
the toy diaper and food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay's looking at me like, God,
we didn't discuss this.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as we're doing good things,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, listen, anything that's not like
expired or bad or something we really
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't donate, like, don't be
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't bring us like, you know,
go get, go to the health food store and
[SPEAKER_01]: get some of that Amy's organic chili,
get some soups, shit that people want to
[SPEAKER_01]: eat, like something that you can actually
open and consume instead of like some
[SPEAKER_01]: green beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can do that, but who wants
fucking green beans for dinner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get some soup, some Campbell's good
shit, some chunky shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some, yeah, I'm a vegetarian,
so I'm going to get some of that fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: veggie soup, but go get some meaty soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, we got to feed people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then those gift certificates can be
used.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're just doing non-perishables,
but you need milk.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need butter.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need eggs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Walmart gift card.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where that's going to come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we had more time, we could probably
solicit grocery stores and stuff for
[SPEAKER_08]: turkeys, but this year, not this year,
but next year guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to make it really,
really huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you prefer them wrap or not wrap the
gifts for the kids?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I say not wrap.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let the family resource center do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll do this and then turn it
over to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't wrap them up you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to donate wrapping papers so
that they can be wrapped, go for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't wrap them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of said that because I want to see
what's in there so that I make sure you're
[SPEAKER_08]: not giving these kids a box of dicks or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And besides that, how do you know that
there's not a used toy wrapped up in
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause unfortunately I would love to think
that we're all honest, but we're not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody out there is not honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a really horrible prank.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to, we're going to distribute
the boxes next Friday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next Friday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that our timeframe?
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to put them out next Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will the day be on that Friday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I know I had done fucked up and
asked the same question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's next Friday of the 18th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the drop off no later than December
16th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making notes because I want to
make sure that this podcast comes out at
[SPEAKER_01]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put this out on the 17th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I run down the spot, the drop off?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're thinking about, we haven't fine
tuned this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're, we're still kind of, kind of work
on it, but we're thinking we could make
[SPEAKER_08]: this into like a little competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I've, uh, some of the, the drop off
spots, one of them being, uh, elevate
[SPEAKER_08]: already said, well, how about if every
place put a little gift in there?
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, I'll throw something in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the end, the person that
collected the most gets the little prize
[SPEAKER_08]: package from the 20 drop off spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: And granny goes and spends a day with them
doing something fun at their facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could turn this into a fun competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can win a date with granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and, and like the, I know some
of the dispensaries are going to go penny
[SPEAKER_08]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know that there's already some
specials.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll, we'll go through the,
the people we have, like Lindsay said,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's only three spots left.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to, um, I get one to fill
one of the last three spots, I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have a place where you can
collect canned foods, a high traffic area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be able to participate with the
cannabis community and be proud of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got any fear or hatred toward
the cannabis community, please don't
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to this ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not going to junk up your
facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you call and say the box is full,
somebody will be there to pick it up and
[SPEAKER_08]: your lobby or wherever you have the box
will not be an eyesore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a win-win situation because you
get, you get free publicity on my social
[SPEAKER_08]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be okay with granny
publicizing your area, your, your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, your store, wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a head shop, if it's a grow store,
if it's a dispensary, uh, if it's a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: shop, I think I said head shop,
but I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might not have anywhere that cannabis
consumers or counterculture folk
[SPEAKER_01]: millennials may roam coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm down for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I bet you by the time this comes
out, you'll have your three slots filled
[SPEAKER_01]: because you are a, you're a networking
young lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what I seem to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A higher elevation has got to be on your
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me run down the list.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear the 17 glass grinds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, there I know they're located down on
the south end of town, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere I feel more than of course the
traveling stoners place a business green
[SPEAKER_08]: and healthy wellness can a Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're over on old Colorado, the weed
pimps.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're fun guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_08]: They make me laugh every time I seen it
elevate and hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a box at both locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's one down on the, uh,
circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have one up on Academy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both stores will have a box grow life,
uh, net.
[SPEAKER_08]: Natural mystics caregivers are downtown.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Joey?
[SPEAKER_08]: DBK glass, the family joint, the dankery.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a new dispenser.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I tell you something funny about the
dankery?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's funny and not derogatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not at all derogatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I once managed a nonprofit on a
military installation in Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was let go because of dabbing
granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody there ever talks to me anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made new friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my life has gotten much better.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I liked what I did, but box next.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran into the dankery just cause it was a
new dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was with one of my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: They took a picture cause they were very
happy to see the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my former volunteers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I was a volunteer organization.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got in touch with me and said,
Gail Gail is my real name.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were at my son's dispensary today.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, in almost a year, you're the
first person that has reached out to talk
[SPEAKER_08]: to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she, so she was very happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the dankery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks that people just just shunned
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but look at the great friends I've
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've replaced them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way better company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Truthfully people, somebody asked me in
one of my comments today, they said,
[SPEAKER_08]: did you ever think at your age,
you would be this important person in the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, no, I pinch myself every
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, how can this be?
[SPEAKER_08]: How can this be?
[SPEAKER_08]: I embrace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No security clearance to get in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What had, what'd you do to Lindsay dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: She got her own dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: She set herself up.
[SPEAKER_04]: She heated her own nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: She in there puking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think she's puking, but she,
I can hear her coughing through the walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: She went on a coughing fit and I don't
think she, she tried to hold it for the
[SPEAKER_04]: mics to not like die in this room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about you earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did your ears ring?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause Chris said, I watched you do that
dab and you just kept going in and you
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't cough.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so mesmerizing watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, you have Jeff to thank for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if you know this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You, when I, I think it might've been the
first time we met at the first podcast and
[SPEAKER_08]: we talked about coughing during doing big,
and you said, well, I very rarely cough
[SPEAKER_08]: because you own your lungs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell them what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I feel that tickle and you all
know what I mean when I say I feel that
[SPEAKER_08]: tickle, I hear that your voice in my head
and I almost meditate with my eyes open
[SPEAKER_08]: that I am not going to cough.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never talked about this on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only told like four people in my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This granny was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take giant dab to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you feel like you're going to cough,
when you feel that thing that goes like
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you blow out the dab and you start to
go, do you feel that shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're, when you're walking at the
mall, if you get a little cramp and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, just fucking fall down and
start spams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you do, I'm sorry, but you've got
a condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't just fall down and
fucking spaz out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was for just a second, but most normal
folk, if you get a cramp, you don't just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking fall down and spaz out in the
middle of the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, that's what my lungs are
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're throwing a fit like a fucking mad
child to cramp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that cough coming and I either
inhale or exhale as hard as I can distract
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when your dog's trying to run away at
a cat, you just pull the leash and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: treat in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It forgets about the cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at the tree and goes,
Oh, treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just breathe in real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lungs like air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just suck that in instead of
trying to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's good for me or bad
for me, but it works, but it's got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better than coughing so hard and blowing
out my face and getting red eyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've coughed so hard, blown up fucking
blood vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get abs when I do cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I do those little coughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a shit cough, but I don't let
those, those deaths, that true core
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every now and again, I've smoked strange
product and get wet lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pho.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's in my opinion,
when I smoke pho, I know that sounds weird
[SPEAKER_01]: to a lot of people in random places,
but that you can make quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates with propane if you do it
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes out like live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out really moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I smoke it, my lungs feel heavy
and I spit up all cough up the next
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll cough up a bright green or a bright
yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golf golf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you're sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I need, but once it comes out,
I'm marvelous, but it's wet in your lungs
[SPEAKER_08]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we should finish our list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to keep you on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 80 hashtag.
[SPEAKER_08]: They like it when we ramble back to as,
as you always say, let's get back to the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, new age medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're all by garden of the gods.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Bailey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to new age medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rocky mountain dabber.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweed leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweed leaf is really, um, I'm glad they're
on board cause they actually once a month
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to do a charity event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody seemed to want cannabis money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hard part about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found a grow for vets finally took
money, but it was really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_08]: find anybody that will take cannabis
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vets always need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always great to help the vets and
they'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ever need some more to send
stuff, I've got a guy who runs a veteran
[SPEAKER_01]: organization that will always need
contributions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, she asked me again, can we do once
one Saturday a month where 10% of
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody's purchase goes directly to a
charity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to Renee at Tweedleaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty nice dispensary too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I know it's not, it's not yours
actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even that I don't, but you do
know one thing about me is that that sense
[SPEAKER_08]: of loyalty I have, it's just, I go to
other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do primarily shop at green and healthy,
but I visit other dispensaries and I go
[SPEAKER_03]: into other places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they don't grow every strand in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, like I like to go to other
places.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, I just have to, I cannot go to one
dispensary because of the different drops
[SPEAKER_08]: and I, and y'all know, I've developed
great taste buds for different product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was complimenting you earlier on your,
your ability to shop everywhere that I can
[SPEAKER_08]: recognize.
[SPEAKER_08]: Concentrates by their containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of get around in a good way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoy being able to tell people,
you know, this is really good product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go spend your X amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day in the late afternoon,
around two 30, three o'clock, you can open
[SPEAKER_01]: up Instagram and see where granny decided
to shop today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one or two shots of her and the
cool bud tender there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would treat her politely.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always a shot of me on somebody's
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it when you pop up somewhere
random.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, she's at, I can almost tell
where you are like, oh, she went to
[SPEAKER_01]: elevate and then she had lunch and then
she took, yeah, she took grumpy grandpa
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere that you went to the glass
grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Altitude meds.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're downtown, I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, wherever they are, we're going to
have boxes and all their locations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Emerald city wellness, the pink house and
stained glass LLC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that leaves three spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get in touch with me, DM me on Instagram,
dabbing underscore granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think those spots will fill up quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'll probably have those filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes out in like seven or 10 days
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these seven, 10, these will probably be
filled up hopefully with much faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what we need now is people to go to
these locations with a non-perishable can
[SPEAKER_01]: good that you would eat you guys,
that you would put in a pan and heat up
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and sit down and fucking enjoy
like a meal by yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bring us a bunch of random side
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to feed some people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you're not a big shopper.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what that mason jar is going to be
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the most honorable community.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can drop your money in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will get it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can leave your badge or your ID behind
because we're all stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we drop some shit, we hope that
you're going to hand it to me also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I've just been lucky, but I,
I hear it's pretty, pretty often that
[SPEAKER_08]: people always get back their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said though, if you're broke and
all you have in your cabinet is something
[SPEAKER_03]: and all you want to bring, you want to
bring something in, like we will take,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like you can participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't feel like we're sitting here
and saying, don't bring anything in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if, you know, like, believe me,
I've been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not this, but this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't bring that, but that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only steak and lobster and live residence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just sitting there thinking like,
oh God, three years ago I would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: like, well shit, I'm not bringing anything
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to feed some people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might've been one of the people that
hopefully was benefiting from our little
[SPEAKER_08]: food drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The college one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people unfortunately are right at
that line where they don't need the help,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they can't afford to give any help.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like where most folks are right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Making crucial decisions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I need this or do we want to eat at the
end of the week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to wipe my ass or get high
this week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's kind of time to decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can walk to work, not get gassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's figure this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we give up?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you just gave me a sinking feeling of
recreation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you said Medicaid or wipe your butt,
I'm afraid that's what Californians are
[SPEAKER_08]: facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to stay out of a lot of the
California stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see both sides of it and I try to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colorado, we did all the things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it right here as usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought that we had lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought that we had lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston initiative here in Pueblo and they
are recounting and still counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that we may have actually
won three of the four major cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may actually get to open recreational
cannabis facilities within the city limits
[SPEAKER_01]: of Pueblo before too long here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a new job?
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll both go work in a new dispenser and
be bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be so much fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did white Mike have anything to do with
this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was he quite the activist for all the
things that were going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike did a lot of groundwork and a
lot of internet work and a lot of podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you want to give Mike a shout
out, he might appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only met him once, but yeah,
shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I listened to your podcast where I
gained so much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've listened to Mike and even though
I met him one time in person where he was
[SPEAKER_08]: so quiet, he's not that way on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's quiet until he gets a read on you and
knows how much of him you want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he gave you enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was, yeah, he was taught to speak
when spoken to and shut the fuck up when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's time to shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very knowledgeable about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you white Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky to have such a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've got growers and we've got
activists and we've got city council
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got glass makers so that we can
consume our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Lindsay over here promoting us
and keeping us medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that meant, but that was
a bubble fish face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be time to start trolling Lindsay
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were throwing up from your
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just some coughs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took it way too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even that it was a big dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, and I, cause I mean, I was like,
she got her own dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: She hit her own nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what I grabbed
because I had actually forgotten it was
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big chunk of two or three things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dab was fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was after I sat here for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Ooh, that was really freaking
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that really hurt my chest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh yeah, I'm going to
cough for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Mike it up in here and you can
cough like Mike on the podcast for 10
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just reach over and turn Mike's
microphone down when he starts doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gives me the, he points down and I'm
like, I got you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn that down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a canned food drive toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also guys, toys are rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring some toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Ninja turtles or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, something that you'd want to play
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't got, don't all have a bunch of
extra money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this will end the drop off date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll end December 10th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got nearly a month from the time
that this episode comes out pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: December 16th, December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't read my own damn writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut my finger a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's a week before Christmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it to these folks over the weekend and
they can distribute it that week of
[SPEAKER_08]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some happy kids, make some bellies
happy, make some folks happy, brighten up
[SPEAKER_01]: some holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, whatever holiday you celebrate,
share some, share some joy, help some
[SPEAKER_01]: people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The winter gets cold and shitty here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the cold, the snow, the slowness,
the fucking bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That vibe makes a lot of people depressed
and sad anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got a shitty Christmas on top
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not doing well, it really fucks
things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got kids on top of that,
that's just the icing on the damn poor
[SPEAKER_01]: cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps some people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make them, make them have a little,
little better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids don't know any different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you don't break them early,
they get a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's try to help them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to raise strippers and
serial killers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny turned red and blushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never seen granny blush before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize or Andrew, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down just a one word note and I'm,
I'm going to wait till you get done taking
[SPEAKER_01]: that drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't want you to spread all over
the table, but or all over me or all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause she's looking right at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new trend in cannabis that I have been
catching on to, uh, is the suppositories.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to let's, let's be legitimate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: May I steal some of your green crack tabs
to place on my turps?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you ma'am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is going to do me just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This green crack turps on the,
uh, what kind of shatter do I has?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is black cherry Maduro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the string.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first heard about them damn
suppositories, even I was kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: skeptical, but I have a pretty sick
husband.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought, okay, this is really going
to help weaning them off the morphine and
[SPEAKER_08]: all that with this pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I have discovered is most of you men
are homophobic.
[SPEAKER_08]: You met, you mentioned suppositories and I
see you visibly squeezing your butt cheeks
[SPEAKER_08]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Women on the other hand, you know,
we spit 10 pound babies out our vaginas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's a suppository?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay's not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, we don't do that over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like on command or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took these home from my husband and I
was like, look what I brought you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're 50% THC, 50% um, CBDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a brain fart and he said,
you stick that up your ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is at least 12 hours of euphoria is the
best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can function.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not intoxicated, but you're
euphoric.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used one the night we had our girls
taken care of and it eased the pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my thought was, all right, now these
things are really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are truly a medical patient for
real, if you're especially cancer patient,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're vomiting, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skip that whole part of the body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you and I know that the divine creator
did not make our lungs to ingest
[SPEAKER_08]: irritants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of us like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know it's really not the best way to
medicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: No ifs ands or buts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to smoke though.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you truly need to medicate,
there are so many membranes in your anus
[SPEAKER_08]: using these suppositories is a wonderful
way to medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis isn't the first medicine they've
used as a suppository.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the newest and it's just on
our realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's what we're talking about now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used for, I'm going to say
hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain, but I'm sure people have
been boofing things for way longer than
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the best way to medicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next week we'll skip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stuck one up my butt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stuck a couple of them up my butt by
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband had to have a colonoscopy the
next week and he came home.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's out grumpy after his colonoscopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was in pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was grouchy and I was like,
your butt hole is already stretched out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try one of them suppositories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he, I'm so glad he does not listen to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: He tried one and he was like, you're
right.
[SPEAKER_08]: My lower back pain is gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel the nauseousness in my belly
that I feel when I take a morphine for
[SPEAKER_08]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm swimming from that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've put a little too much turps,
but I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pure green crack distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like 96% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put a little line across the dab
and, uh, it made my brain swim around in
[SPEAKER_01]: my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I tell the story about the green
crack?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're smoking on this stuff called green
crack, which is a pretty sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_08]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you all agree sitting around the dab,
I just took, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not a real sativa person,
but I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you buy this, um, distilled hash,
it's solventless.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes in a little syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very big.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a very small part where you have
the medicine actually comes out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: syringe, like where a needle would be,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no needle on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shit out of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, we don't want to say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally just a glass syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like maybe if you have children,
you've used them for pulling up a
[SPEAKER_08]: moxacillin or an antibiotic to give to
your baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have pets, I was going to say
it'd be good to feed a baby bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a really good description to
put the idea in people's heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be perfect to feed a baby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you had rodents or mice or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really do like these suppositories
for medicating.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to say where,
but a bartender said, well, have you tried
[SPEAKER_08]: that hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, well, you should try that green
crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he only asked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went home.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was bouncing off the wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: She squirted an entire gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I went back to that bug tender,
I was like, my God, I was bouncing off the
[SPEAKER_08]: walls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I had consumed huge amounts of
caffeine and lots of other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, granny, you didn't do the
whole gram, did you?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 800 and something milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably about somewhere between 800
and 900 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Word from granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't try that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like when I did all those edibles
after the secret session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure you don't have to
discourage too many people sticking too
[SPEAKER_01]: much hash in their ass on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they were to try it, how much of- I
really wouldn't suggest doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that product's made for
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The suppositories, however, would you do
that again?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do them regularly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've given some to the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can ask her what her effect was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched her put her head down in
blushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she can't be like, Oh God,
she's putting me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about true medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I ever did one,
um, I actually did the fouria ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I had gotten the fouria ones as a
sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so long ago and I never used them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once Gail started doing them,
was talking about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was supposed to go to Denver and,
um, meet up with one of our friends for
[SPEAKER_03]: her birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was in a lot of pain that morning
and I was like, shit, I really need to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, we have plans and I really
can't let this like fuck up our birth
[SPEAKER_03]: plan, you know, plans for her birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said to Chris, I'm like, I don't know
what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you need to put one of those
suppositories in and just try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I ever took one,
the fouria ones are a lot stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like the 50 50 ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first time I ever took it,
I was like Gumby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, I think because I was in a
lot of pain, like I just, um, like
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately was out of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird, but yeah, like you can ask
Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I couldn't really move my
lower half and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I don't even feel my lower
half.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it took care of all that female pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were having true, true medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take to kick in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, about 15, 20.
Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, granny gave me some drops,
some oral sublingual drops today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt those within like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're, they're pretty good for a
tincture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause a lot of tinctures are very ashy
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very, uh, it was a very clean,
almost like a green tea, but very light
[SPEAKER_01]: diluted green tea flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Lindsay was kind enough to throw
me some of a pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumpkin spice, the white girl,
uh, incredible's edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was delicious and they're kicking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all working now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so proud of you that you jumped back
on the edible bag bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just needed to clean out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to kind of flush the edible system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went through that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've tallied.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate 5,200 milligrams of edibles the
Sunday after the secret session we were
[SPEAKER_08]: at.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Max's bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Max.
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 pieces.
[SPEAKER_07]: Granny ate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate two cookies that were about 500
milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those lemon ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate two cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: What were those?
[SPEAKER_08]: 150?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the cupcakes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry pink cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a different session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop Jeff, because those were amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those ones you had gotten, we got the half
dozen of the solventless pretty fancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the donuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I, what did I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's immediately what I thought
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the second secret session,
ever in Colorado, it was in May.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you had literally flown out the
day before.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's looking like I know the cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: He saw pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he looks like he ate the donuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he knows the donuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, those strawberry lemonade
cupcakes from secret session.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so funny because Jeff and I
both, when I walked in, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we both looked at each other and we're
like, we're not going to eat edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I found Jeff in the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had he already consumed edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Mill brought me on stage and gave me
a two gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then asked, did he do one with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he, we, we kind of fixed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, he knows that I like to take big dabs
and we're buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was on stage and he goes,
I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes to say, I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm higher than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my Adam Mill impersonation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he grabs his shirt, like he's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pointed out and I go, no,
you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm taller than him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're much taller than him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think even I was taller than Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've got a really killer picture of
the two of you on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were talking and you didn't know
I was taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought there's two of my favorite
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take a picture of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, Adam calls me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, uh, Jeff, I'm higher than you
come up on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fucking, yeah, that's my Adam Mill
impersonation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really fun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really, it's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just plug your nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he comes up and he's like, you think
you could take a big dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I can do a big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, you ready for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And stretches out two grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, ah, shit, I didn't know
that's what was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he heated the nail to where it was
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, let it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, nope, just hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, let it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like hesitated like as long as I
could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I just went in cause he was
pushing it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pulled the whole thing and then I
blew it out and he's like, damn,
[SPEAKER_01]: this guy's a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's like, can you do a bigger
dab than him?
[SPEAKER_01]: And people like, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would come up on stage and we
would dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kept dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't finish their dabs and I
would grab the rig from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would finish their dab for them
and set the rig down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, that only lasted for one
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam does like little 45 minute things and
then goes and takes a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walks around the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to go sit upstairs and eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't real food there at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ate about 12 bags of chips in like
seven bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really high.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I didn't want to do a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: A gram dab in that relay thing we were in,
but I wanted to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Max, he did up my nail and he's like,
let it cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, no, no, I want to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to hit it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to hit it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go a little hotter than a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot dads aren't too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to actually move the nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not lying because I sat down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sitting right in front of the email.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at the other end of the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, is that email that hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But everybody's email is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I don't, it's really not as high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can keep my hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guys, when you do big dabs like Jeff
and I do the traveling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely watched the email struggle
when Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you start, you start dropping it
and you see the temperature dropping right
[SPEAKER_01]: with your keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, I hear some of the time I can
hear my dab hardening up on the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, it's like, I can't keep
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to, you got to either suck harder
or slower or turning this thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the wheels in your sky turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from suppositories to this really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that escalated that way,
but I'm really glad that it did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you finish your story about
suppositories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got Gumby and it solved her woman
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a much better day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you've figured out a better dosage
haven't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I mean that we've got the smaller
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need the big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to a hundred hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you are doing a hundred milligrams
of THC and a hundred milligrams of CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: a suppository.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred milligrams of edibles is of THC
is enough for most people to orally
[SPEAKER_01]: consume and be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't get like, Ooh, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, Ooh, I'm high off of a
hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I eat a hundred milligrams and then
take dabs like normal, then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm high now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I eat edibles also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but if just that amount of edibles
wouldn't have done it, but the two like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, it kind of, it's like a turbo
makes your high turbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gives you a little boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm not like a scientist,
but I pay attention to the body and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I care about physical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how quickly your bum is going to
absorb that much medicine and you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to absorb all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to poop any of it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your stomach's not going to destroy any of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your liver and kidneys aren't going to
ruin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to suck all up into you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, when I do try that high of a dosage,
that will be, you know, for me,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's going to be even high for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to test it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We Facebook live it after, after you've
got it inserted and hands washed.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll even put on my new outfit that the
lady from U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: 420 bought me as a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so many cool friends to give you
so many cool gifts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you sit here, you know me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I very girly girly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it was a very nice gift,
but it's not call yourself on the last
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast in Iowa corn whore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what she gave me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am an Iowa corn whore, but you know what
she gave me?
[SPEAKER_08]: A gift bag from Victoria's secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it goes with the new, but it wasn't
so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked at it and I was like,
really?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's yoga pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, and a thing that says U S army and
gold sequence bling.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to pull you back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the Victoria's secrets.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's your jeans and
T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I told tater that he is, I said,
I've never been in a Victoria's secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what he said?
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I've been in many,
many of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say that too, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've been there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've totally been.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is my thought on Victoria's
secrets, truthfully.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is expensive and naked always worked
for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why do you need these fancy thongs and
shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to pull that shit off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, unless you're strutting around in
your heels, a baby, you just don't need
[SPEAKER_08]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather buy medicine because I wish you
could have seen the animation that went
[SPEAKER_01]: along with my pen and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything went wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So granny gets tons of great gifts is
something I mentioned, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's, she's a karmic gift person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, she brought me, I've got a frisbee
that is full of other gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, so she's, she's a good car.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't just get gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does give them back.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's always, always got a basket full of
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take dabs and you're sitting
there looking like you're depleted,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's like, you want some milk duds?
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I bring me milk chocolate suckers
tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To drop into the, to the hot chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, let's recap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like everybody's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a quick recap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a year on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems to like my silliness and
quirkiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, I'm always on the lookout
for fun hats and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I have found for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_08]: You all are going to love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow her on social media so that you can
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, uh, periscope and Facebook live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause she does a lot of stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She smokes down.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new app that I've been on toke
with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and this is kind of fun cause it's
just people in the cannabis community and
[SPEAKER_08]: what the end goal of this app is they want
to be able to have multi cam users.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wouldn't just be you sitting there
watching me smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us would be interacting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like a tiny chat sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm kind of helping them promote this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw toke with, and I actually
assumed that it was a pothead dating
[SPEAKER_01]: service.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the green tinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that getting high with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there really one of those?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like grinder or tinder or grinder is for
gay dudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, then we don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you, if you need grinder,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to discriminate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pass me my phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I got it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis dating cert?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I just mouthed him like,
yo, hand me my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Oh, Jeff's like, Oh,
Lindsay just wants for the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're going to give them a free
ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's basically a hookup app
for potheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys go check that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you will not find me on that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am done as fuck with all that dating app
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three strikes, you're out motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done did me wrong three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought me three bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's change the subject before I put
this pen in my eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, that is a stylist as well as a
pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety tip for my protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suicide free pens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to shout them guys out cause they
make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the pot brothers at law.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're out in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Mark and Craig.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think their last name is Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a 25 word script, which I will
give you their business card to put in
[SPEAKER_08]: your wallet that there's the 25 word
script.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically the cop says,
where you been?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to discuss where I've been.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to tell you where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end, their hashtag is shut the
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're done, you shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've sent me their hashtag hat and I
wear it and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people know what senior hashtag STF
you have from my friends, the pot brothers
[SPEAKER_01]: at law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they could be was slaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to call them eight five five
was slaw, but I think was law is more
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate, but check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop brothers at law.

[SPEAKER_01]: They do have funny social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was somebody else that we were

promo.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just remembered that, but you get what
you paid for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like if you were buying Bobo
blasters, anything Bobo blaster makes
[SPEAKER_01]: great email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be a little cleaned off and
used, but you know yourself, if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: making it, if you're making American
products, you're going to get what you pay
[SPEAKER_08]: for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And August house is American.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's, he, have you ever heard of them?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was happy that you finally
got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you showed me them a while back and
it's pretty small.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have actually brought it with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes in a little box where you can
take it along with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the nail looked really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I say, I don't like emails,
but y'all have been seeing me and I liked
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put my clear rates on top of that
and make it look cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the lights on the top.

heart or a young hippie.

[SPEAKER_01]: You guys watch the videos, watch the stuff
with all the Russian comments from other
[SPEAKER_01]: people and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what people from other countries say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The comments are my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people say, sometimes they're
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got to, if you're on the
internet, expect that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I have come to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody thought Sam and I were a couple
THC, Sam, they said, Oh dude, granny sex
[SPEAKER_08]: is the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck as a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as we logged into Facebook live,
people asked if we were going to hook up
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the nature of the beast with the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have no lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes not everybody's trying to do
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out there just trying to get
noticed and that's their way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not, if you're not part of
anything, you'll do your best to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: create something to be a part of.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just say some profound shit on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has me gone.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms. Lindsay, the traveling stoner remind
everybody how they can find you because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you promised us that by the time we
record it again, you'd have a website
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I heard that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a photo shoot on the 16th of
this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be launching the website at the
end of this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually for real this time, I have been
working really hard on it so it will be
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out at the end of the month.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now I am the traveling stoner on
Instagram and periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can find me on Twitter as the
travel stoner and you can find me on
[SPEAKER_03]: Snapchat as a travel and stoner without
the G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what's your home address?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that address?
[SPEAKER_01]: Use maps to find where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in an undisclosed bunker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the, this, the studio needs a
name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes you do because I, um, you know how
Instagram has that little story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I deleted quite a few cause I actually,
I didn't even want to say the name of the
[SPEAKER_08]: city cause I have learned people will try
to find me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just said as being on your podcast,
they don't know, they don't know where you
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys found me through granny's
feed by any way, uh, if granny,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you learned of this podcast through
granny, send me a message or tag me in
[SPEAKER_01]: something and just say, Hey, I found you
through the diving granny so that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: give her a hug for every one of those
followers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So follow the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to get her together and get
her website up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take some pictures of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a cool camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even being creepy wherever you
want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't give you the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the sun coming from that way and I
need you over there and we'll fucking take
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just take pictures of weed to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be on a bill Bordock Colfax
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: A real picture of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that one hat pin, the tall one
where I'm holding that teapot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: THC Sam and I had a photo shoot and
they're putting me on a billboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, for THC magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're advertising?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of product is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this little teapot thing that goes on
a pen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a bubbler attachment.
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks like a teapot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love smoking out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do an Instagram video with it so that we
can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're going to go one better.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the billboards up, we're going to do
a group dab up under the billboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a grand dab up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hanging from the billboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that sound like fun?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hanging.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how, but.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you Brett?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm Spiderman.
[SPEAKER_08]: Made me think of a, what was that show?
[SPEAKER_08]: Spiderman.
[SPEAKER_08]: The 70's show they used to climb up the
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've climbed up a few water towers in my
life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Brett, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Brett.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for being awesome and for always
being so positive and loving his videos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been sick lately, so I hope
you're getting over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're feeling better by the time this
comes out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get with him and do this cold
terping thing that I've been hearing
[SPEAKER_08]: about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some terps, I've got this
device here that you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll guide you through that as soon as,
yeah, we'll wrap up here and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little Colorado flag Millie on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris made that for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's all me.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is your Millie?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my first, my first functional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're giving shout outs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out and a
heads up to our buddy THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam wanted to come tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: His life's been overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got to interview Tommy Chong,
so he didn't have time to make it here
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tommy Chong, us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works for a magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody like Tommy Chong comes
through town, your job is to go take
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and do magazine shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cannabis based magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess you have to, that's your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam, you've got an open invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three chairs here at the table
that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them has got your name on it
whenever you want to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Brett, I want to come get you,
or I want to get you to come be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show here at my house where we've got this
good studio, the good mics where the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment doesn't screw up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody interrupts other than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get you organized.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kabuki Fox.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had some real good conversations with
him about CBDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kabuki's been on a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's due for another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get him here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to have Kabuki across the table,
talk about certain doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of specific cannabinoids for certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So between the CBDs and Brett with the
Terps, we're talking new age medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sam, Sam and I, I love to talk about
traumatic brain injuries with Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause of course everybody knows that I've
got a TBI that fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear it on the podcast occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stop and start a brand new
sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't know what the fuck I'm even
saying anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from getting hit in the head
really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that is from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize when that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to say that Sam is actually
running this food drive with us as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgot to even like, that's why Sam was
supposed to be here tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, duh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a suppository before we came in too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, Sam is also another big part of
helping us getting this food drive
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_08]: As is, uh, the people over at the glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spaced out on her Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's blown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cloudy Cody.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going to help us with the flyers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we caught up on that and didn't
skip people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all high here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: People understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least we told them what the,
you know, food drive was about.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not concrete.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas we have Friday to get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we still have three spots
open for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bobo, I did not forget you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a mental note.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still got to let Bobo do plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still available on big cartel.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still active.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll get too many orders.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not super, super busy, but I'm
still doing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still, uh, available.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still do custom stuff with that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focusing pretty heavily on the new glass
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my, so follow the new, the new
glass page, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow new glass page.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no, no me glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's N O M E glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can also follow my normal
Instagram is Bobo blast.

[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Bo B O B O blaster CO.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same thing on periscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I think that's all I'm on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not one of those people that's on
every single social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm barely on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to go through spurs, but you were
like logging off right as I got in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go through spurs where I'm like,
Jeff is here, Bobo's gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so happy to see him today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just thought of somebody else.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to shout out color me filthy.

and we're part of his little family.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the zombie photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been seeing of everybody turning you
guys all green, killing everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just make stickers out of all those.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: What he's been doing to my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm addicted to bitmojis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are so obsessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the funnest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little Rasta Jeff everywhere doing

and until next time, take a fat dab and
[SPEAKER_01]: give your mama a hug for me.
It's
[SPEAKER_05]: not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it's getting pretty tame.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not that great anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll go outside and fly a weasel
for a ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it on down to the shore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Waluing in fear, the days and weeks that
you're not here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all the waiting in vain.
