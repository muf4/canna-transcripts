[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen I do want to let you
know that I was just on the Dude Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recorded what I think was a great
episode with the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scotty Real is on a vacation so I got to
co-host the show and fill in for Scotty
[SPEAKER_01]: Real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I've said too much already but make
sure to look forward and stay tuned for
[SPEAKER_01]: the episode of the Dude Grow Show
featuring myself as a co-host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to my friends at the Dude Grow
Show for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to find my balance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I should talk more but also I
feel like I'm interrupting a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk a lot enough here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole new dynamic learning to have
a co-host so I hope you watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered some great topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed some great photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway check out the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to talk about the Dude Grows
Show you know I have got to talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right coming up at the end of July
30th in Fort Collins Colorado I will be
[SPEAKER_01]: attending and vending at the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come smoke some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab some beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a selfie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a great time to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reconnect with you at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: More info is on the Dude Grows website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's dudegrows.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out for all the links,
dates, deets and info right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for clearing the throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just take a fat dab right before I
pressed record here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took a fat dab of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I bought it I was confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it says ROYGBIV and then
luckily I've got a lot of friends with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cool jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me that this ROYGBIV I'm
going to show that to the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it'll pick it up from that
far away but it is the letters
[SPEAKER_01]: R-O-Y-G-B-I-V and then the word red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read it as ROYGBIV.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our good friends told me that that
is actually red, orange, yellow,
[SPEAKER_01]: green, blue, indigo and violet and red
which makes a lot of sense because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a blend of headbanger and rainbow belts
and on the package the flavor is of course
[SPEAKER_01]: described as gassy rainbows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a big old fat dab of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got me a little bit choked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got me coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize for the funky throat here
at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get when you listen to a
dab and a grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I wanted to let you know what I'm
smoking and let you know why I sound like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm clogged up here at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about the Dude Grows show and the
Dude Grows cup, while I was on the Dude
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows show, I did drop some hints,
some information, some details that you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys may not know that I think I should
share here with my audience since I said
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently told you that I put the plants
out in the greenhouse to do a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not revealed what plants are out
there but I did say on the Dude Grows show
[SPEAKER_01]: that I put a Jack the Ripper male outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outdoor pollen donor will be the Jack
the Ripper plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two clones of the Jack the
Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in different places in the grow,
of course different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't be both in the same spot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two strategically placed Jack
the Ripper males, the same cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same male, just two plants,
two clones of the same plant in different
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we can maximize pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know how the air moves in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what plants are going to get the
most pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it set up how we want it,
but the male plants that are in there are
[SPEAKER_01]: the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the crosses that come from there
will be the Jack the Ripper crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will of course all be regular
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not going to be feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be rags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the Jack the Ripper crosses
that you have seen may be being remade,
[SPEAKER_01]: restocked with the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also there may be some brand new stuff
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep listening to future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned to the social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to leak info like that slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to tell you the whole
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just put them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't give you all the details and info
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also on Caribou Heart TV there's a
great podcast on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a hang, not as much of a
podcast, I guess, but it is on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great hangout to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Caribou Heart TV,
C-A-R-I-B-O-O, Heart TV, Caribou Heart TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how they spell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did hang out on their show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all of my friends at Caribou
Heart TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like nine people over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to start giving out shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the whole list here,
but shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of, a great collection of
personalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, from across the
nation, great accents and great people all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole crew is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was on their show and in their show,
we did fall into a conversation about
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do believe that in that episode,
I said that flowering times are often like
[SPEAKER_01]: a speed limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're not fully aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the sole breeder, sole proprietor for
iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can't say sole anymore because we
do have the greenhouse and, but I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: lead breeder, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: For iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is done under my supervision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm leaning at is I make the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the labels on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes time to determining how long
a plant should be flowered, I am the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that writes the flowering time on the
package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get a pack of seeds, it's very
common that it will say strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: starburst, nine to 10 weeks flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that it would typically
say on a seed package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them don't say that, but it is
listed on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't say that, I just have to
update the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I am the one that puts that
flowering time on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I determine that flowering time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've determined that by sending out a lot
of testers of those seeds, by growing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of those seeds myself and taking them
to a full flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a pretty good idea of how long
they're going to take to flower because I
[SPEAKER_01]: have grown them enough to have experience
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: History, notes, basically experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I write down, this time it took eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This phenotype took eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This phenotype took nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I put an average together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that on the back of the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my suggestion that you flower those
plants for that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I put that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now keep in mind, there will be most of
the phenotypes, probably 70 to 80% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes that you find in those seed
packs will fall within the timeframe that
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I said eight to nine weeks or nine to
10 weeks, most of your phenotypes are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fall within that window.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some that most likely I am
not even going to try to say that some
[SPEAKER_01]: will finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that say their plants finish super
early, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like later finishing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to try to hype you up and
make you think they finish earlier than
[SPEAKER_01]: they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take nine, maybe 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some phenotypes in there that
do go a little bit longer than the nine to
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 weeks that I recommended on the
package, but it will be unlikely that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get earlier finishers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the 10 to 20%, they may go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get a 12 week finisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just how genetics work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there are outliers that pop up
in population.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my recommendation that you go the
time that I wrote on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say go nine weeks, I don't mean go
the end of eight weeks and the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ninth week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean finish the ninth week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I say nine to 10 weeks, I'm
recommending to finish that 10th week,
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 full days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely recommend going longer on
your first run with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time you're growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to build a relationship with this
plant and see what its potential is and
[SPEAKER_01]: what it does and what it likes and what it
doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first run, why not go 70 days or
why not take a few clones and run 160,
[SPEAKER_01]: 163, 165, 167, and 170, and then 172 and
75.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm being, that's a dream life,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's everybody's dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do what you can to see how long that
plant can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it the full term and see what it
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may get really good at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants beef up, bulk up, put on
different flavors right at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get super potent right at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give it the opportunity to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I write nine to 10 weeks,
I mean nine full weeks, maybe 10 weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly 11 is what I really mean on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it as a speed limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The speed limit, it's cool if you go the
speed limit, but you could go a little
[SPEAKER_01]: slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could definitely go a little bit
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could adjust to traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you have to adjust for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I took the same plant, so if I found a
plant that finished, I dialed it into
[SPEAKER_01]: where I know that every time 74 days it's
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put it in your grow, it could take 69
or it could take 79 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could take five days either direction
to take a little bit longer or earlier to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish because of the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe you're growing, I'm in,
let's say hypothetically, I'm in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're in living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm running HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're running LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's really humid in my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's really dry and really hot in
your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the differences, but there
could be all of the variables in our rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: create more variables within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is also going to contribute to the
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take 74 in my room, 74.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be overdone, dry, dead and crispy
in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you sprayed yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're playing different music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you touched yours in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be any kind of different thing
that is making our plants have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every variable is a variable that you will
see in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have to adjust for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things may take longer in different
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, I said it is like the speed
limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go the full speed limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go a little bit faster if you
would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I put the nine to 10 weeks on
there, I fully recommend you go at least
[SPEAKER_01]: nine full weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe go all the way up to 10,
maybe 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the next part of the
podcast because I do have another great
[SPEAKER_01]: topic that we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I start talking about it,
I want to say that I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand all of the scientific
doctor talk that comes along with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a biology major.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned most of what I know about
cannabis growing by growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people go to school for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got mad respect for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the people that paid for an education
that went to school, that is not how I
[SPEAKER_01]: learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hands-on learner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some areas where I am not
qualified to teach in a scientific manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to teach you about the hoplite
and viroid in the way that I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about the important parts
that us as growers need to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: understand, and know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to try to identify or
explain what this virus is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a virus that is going around the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plants are getting infected and
getting sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is known as the hop latent viroid or
HLV is what I see it listed as all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is decimating crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is killing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it gets in the plant, I don't know of
a way to get rid of it other than tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the only way you can, and that's
expensive and also not available to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hoplite and viroid, how do we prevent
this virus from getting into our plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times this virus is transferred
when we are cutting clones or doing work
[SPEAKER_01]: in the garden like lollipopping and
bottoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are working with more than one,
I'd like to say change gloves and clean
[SPEAKER_01]: your scissors between every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand sometimes in a commercial
application that is not viable,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe change gloves and change,
clean your scissors between every row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least if you're working with like a
row of blueberry and then a row of
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry, change your gloves and
scissors between those rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way maybe you only infect one row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep the virus contained if you do
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've got to think about is be
careful not to transfer this virus from
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant to the other, from one row to
the other, from one bed to the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: from one section to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to minimize the risk of moving a virus
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that we can do is we can clean
our scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked before about this on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use bleach to clean the scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbing alcohol will not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean all of your tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're using a scalpel,
a razor blade, scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just get a bottle of bleach water
and spray everything down occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely soak your scissors in some
bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sterilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it super clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when there was a pandemic and we
all went crazy and we started,
[SPEAKER_01]: not everybody, but a lot of people went
crazy wearing masks and gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a pandemic in the grow
industry, in the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while there, it was the russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it seems to be the hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got to prepare and protect
ourselves from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's clean all of our equipment very
thoroughly, very cleanly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cleanly, is that the word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean your shit up real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also change your gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gloves are hard to get sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ordered a lot of gloves and they seem
to be coming in and they're trickling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the boxes I ordered are coming in in
small batches, not all at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So change your gloves as often as you
economically can and as you seem
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work at a commercial grow and
you're changing too much, somebody may say
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a home grower, try to keep those
gloves fresh, especially from row to row,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely from room to room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep yourself clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you're cutting the plant,
tearing the plant, removing a leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that you are protecting yourself
in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I want to talk about is,
where are you getting your clones from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are they coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they coming from a friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they coming from the mail?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of services now that offer
clones through the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do get a clone that comes from that
service, and I'm not accusing or blaming,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get that clone that comes from a
company that you don't know or they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any, you don't know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do if they send you
a clone with a virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find out for 30,
60, maybe 90 days that you've even got a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: By then, you've spread it to your entire
grow and your whole grows got a virus and
[SPEAKER_01]: you paid money for that clone,
probably good money for that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you getting your clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently am not accepting clones from
other friends or other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like, hey bro, I want to send
you a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, not right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to be careful right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants are precious to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a breeding company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you wiped out my Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you wiped out my strawberry
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you took out my grateful dog
keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I got a virus, it could ruin
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to keep everything clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you take the same precautions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your plants as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that being said, do you have backups
of your favorite plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my plants are my livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some of my plants are my pride and
joy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a lot of great stuff I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since I'm limited on plant count,
here's where I'll branch off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I'm limited on plant count,
it took a long time, but I've loosened up
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've given clones of some of my prized
possessions to friends of mine to hold on
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really hope and ask them not to
spread those clones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure they're going to end up
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tell my friends like, hey,
I know that you've got a good grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lose this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give them a backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon skunk is somewhere in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goats somewhere in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goats all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the original clone that I've got,
it's been shared with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things are a lot of places so
that if things do go wrong, if I do get a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus and things have to get wiped out and
cleaned up, hopefully I can email a few
[SPEAKER_01]: people, make a few text messages and calls
and get a lot of my original lineup back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, if they don't get the virus as
well, hopefully if I sent them the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: before I did get the virus, which I don't
have, so that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the plants, but that's how it
would have to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have a backup plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you sent your clone somewhere or have
you made S1s of all of your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: plants so that you've got keepers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an idea and a strategy because
this could wipe out your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things that could
decimate your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now the focus is the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a backup for your clones,
your seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a power outage.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my biggest fears is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of shit like that could wipe out
your preserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have a backup somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would start thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my quick ramble on the HLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you I wasn't a Scientologist,
a Biologist, but I do know enough to help
[SPEAKER_01]: protect us as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what we should do as growers and
farmers to make sure we don't get this
[SPEAKER_01]: into our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have one quick email that I will
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This email came from our friend who calls
themselves Ossie Denny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up mate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you and your loved ones are doing
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is great bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says two part question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm here in Prohibition land in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The house I live in, I am renting and I
have a house inspection coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a five by 10 flower room currently
in week three and a five by five in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be the best way to hide all of
these plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good entertaining
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first answer would be, I would have
kind of planned around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have done a little bit of a
strategy around the inspections,
[SPEAKER_01]: but who knows when the inspections are
coming and it's too late to prepare for
[SPEAKER_01]: that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys, if you're thinking about
growing, setting up a grow, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing that you need to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will there be an inspection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will there be like a housing inspection,
a landlord inspection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's coming in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there somebody coming to visit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each grow is going to take about 120 days
for completion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have that much time without
somebody coming into the home,
[SPEAKER_01]: the office, the warehouse, the garage,
the shed, wherever you're doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have that much security?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too late to think about that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are already here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to get those plants
out of there, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, what would be the best way to
hide it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I hire a van or a truck or do I hide
them all in a crawl space in the roof?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have any other sneaky ideas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, because I'm a renter,
I'm unable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the second part of the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sneaky ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think putting them in the crawl space or
something, they're going to stink too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easy way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely the easy way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can prevent the aroma, I would just
drag them all to another space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if you've got the ability
to hide these plants and hide the aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: from the, it's a home inspection from the,
you're renting, so it's the landlord
[SPEAKER_01]: probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how thorough their inspection
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it depends on the rest of the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk in and the living room looks
really good, and it's all vacuumed and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a blanket over the couch and
pillows on the couch like civilized humans
[SPEAKER_01]: live there, there's not piles of beer cans
and cigarette butts everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a beer can and a cigarette,
but piled up in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't have recyclable cans just
piled up over there like it's a sculpture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the landlord's going to want
to look around and see more.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are they ruining my house?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go in and you got some house
plants that look decent, you got,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, a blanket on the couch that's
folded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice people put a blanket over the top of
the couch and just clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't clean up the toilet so there's not
piss everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make them think that you're doing a
little bit of work on the house,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping it looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they walk through, they'll go,
nah, we're out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows what they're going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They could climb under everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could get in stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would consider renting a moving van.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we call it a U-Haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you call it there,
but that's probably something similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Penske or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big box truck, just load them in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can rent something smaller,
throw them in there for the time being.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to think about climate and
temperature control in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have to think about security of
the plants while they're in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay for the truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things to think about
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably would rent that truck and
throw them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend a grow tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are not fans of grow
tents, but if you had two grow tents,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could just move the plants,
move the tents, take everything out,
[SPEAKER_01]: then put it all back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now what you've got to do is get rid
of the plants, then all the gear possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to move all the gear too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't see the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to clean up the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to clean up all of the evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have any leaves, no nutrient
bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be very strategic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I talk about it, the more I see
you putting all of this into a moving van
[SPEAKER_01]: because you got to load up everything,
all the gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can be spotted because one small
thing will make them think that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in there if they do a deep enough
of an inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go with the truck if that's an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go rent the moving van and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, because I'm a renter,
I'm unable to scrub my plants in case of
[SPEAKER_01]: having to move them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would a scrub method be more beneficial or
would you recommend another technique?
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know that you may have to move
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unprofessional, but it's already
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know that you may have to move
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a scrog would have screwed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have been fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't get the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would not be able to get them out of
there to move them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have caused you much more
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think maybe if you can individually
scrog each plant, I don't know how big
[SPEAKER_01]: your pots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got something bigger than a 7 or
a 10 gallon pot, you can put sticks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: corners and make like a scrog out of those
sticks and kind of control the plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or use a tomato cage or start topping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you absolutely are correct that a
scrog may not be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another technique, maybe just tomato
cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato cages are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people use tomato cages on your
Australian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you call them the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three hoops with three legs and you
just shove the legs down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants start to grow up and then you
just pull the branches underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontal hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pull the branches underneath there so
that it gets more space and more air flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can also flip that tomato cage
upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with that pointy and those will
go in your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut those off and you can use those hoops
the same way to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use a lot of bamboo sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people put bamboo sticks around the
pot and then just use that to tie the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches down to the sticks or just to fix
it to the sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they make a lot of those new LST
clips is what I think they call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bend the branch over and just put
a little clip on it and you can shape the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches by using these little clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great tools if you learn how to
use those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely know that scrogging is
not part of the options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, it wraps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps me going on my 12 hour shifts at
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love from Aussie Dank Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aussie, bro, thank you for the great
message.

[SPEAKER_01]: I do look forward to the feedback on how
you're growing, maybe a picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can figure out how to kind of
scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spread your plants out just a little
bit more, get some more light,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a bigger harvest for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
