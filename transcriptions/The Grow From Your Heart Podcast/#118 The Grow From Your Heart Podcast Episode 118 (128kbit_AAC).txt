[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 118 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having a great week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've got a pen and some paper
handy, because this episode is loaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this time we had our friend
Sean, also known as Kingcola, drop by,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to talk about integrated
pest management, and we're also going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about organic hemp farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great episode, in my opinion,
so grab a pen and paper and get ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get that far, this podcast is
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to you by my good friends at
Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I will see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's get right down
to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let the music play for a
couple of seconds, and I'm going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the time machine to get us back a couple
of days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we land there, Sean will be
sitting at the table with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang on, here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the table from me is my good buddy
Sean, also known as Kingcola.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing tonight, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are as red as mine feel,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought some delicious skunk that
tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for the dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that was, but it was
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I get to brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was G-Funk turned into live resin by
our friends at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually grew those flowers at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first harvest at the Grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even know what that was,
and you said it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought Sean on the show to talk
about some integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, man, tell the
people what you have been up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time since you've been on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build some credibility and let all these
folks know what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the last time I was here,
I was working on Three Rivers Organics
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice organic grow out here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finished it out, turned it over to some
great guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, from what I understand,
they're pumping out some great product
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congrats to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved on, was doing some just some
consultation in the industry, different
[SPEAKER_01]: grow gigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing some stuff out, helping some
extraction companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm actually involved in a hemp
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're a nutritional hemp company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pulling our permits through the CDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that we grow is under 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can smoke my whole farm and not get
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the CBD level of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15% is what we're averaging right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: High medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're specializing in extraction of
that through critical CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, do you need to be a medical
patient to receive that since it's no THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be, you can be any age,
from any state, anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just come here to Colorado and get it from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: He invited you, come get it you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be available fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said the word nutritional hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something, a phrase you coined?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could say that technically we
pulled an industrial hemp license and
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp traditionally thought is
going to be fuel, fiber, seed crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Pueblo there's actually a ban on male
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and you had kind of discussed this
earlier and we don't grow male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do, traditionally in a hemp
operation, they drop a pound and a half a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a 50-50 male to female ratio
that rely on the male plant pollen to drop
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC levels in the female to give them
that .03.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas we have been selectively breeding
these high CBD, low THC ratio strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like people have been breeding high
THC, low CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really similar approach to
growing as traditional MMJ style,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with its industrial, technically it's
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't do the male plants and
we're going for the more of the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional factors of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we try to coin this term
nutritional hemp because it's not FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not say there are any medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way to play it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to shout out the name of your
farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sansal CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sansal CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody go and check us out on
Instagram, Facebook, you go to my
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find links through various
pictures, but we've been busting out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 20 acres that we'll be
farming this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a 3000 square foot greenhouse,
11, 2000 square foot hoop houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a 10,000 square foot forever flowering
under construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really planning on producing the
highest quality organic CBD that's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: been produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're on the right path
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you've got to have all
females and no males.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the number of plants that you're
working with, I know the traditional way
[SPEAKER_00]: is to just flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut a cone and flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were working with a very large number
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I have liberty to say
those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys can do the math at home if they
really want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 acres on six foot centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the math on that, but it's a lot of
fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a whole shit ton of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more plants than I ever imagined
being responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said the number, I almost pooped
myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I think about it, I feel that
way, but every day it seems like more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started out with nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an empty field four months ago,
and now we've got this infrastructure we
[SPEAKER_01]: do, and I still have a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a large group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a large group out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a great team out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't stress it enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pablo, Justin, Eric, Chris, Kelly,
Tony, everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just me kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys all heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make them listen.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was getting to is how do you know
that all of those plants, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: verify that all of those plants are
females out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you would indoor, we start off,
see batch, call out the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually had to grow, you had to
flower some of them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, flower them out, call the males,
test out the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew what we were working with,
what to look for, so it wasn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult as one would think, because this
is already something that was in
[SPEAKER_01]: existence, Suzy Q, which maybe some people
are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't too hard for us to work it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started out with quite a few females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then slowly built our way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now we've got a whole army of
mother plants, just cloning, cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a 10,000 square foot propagation
building or greenhouse going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be used for half of it,
for mothers, half of it for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said the strain was called Suzy Q.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Suzy Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, they're kind of just
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you'd buy some pot called sour
diesel or OG Kush, the hemp has the
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now Centennial Seeds, their shout
out to, I don't know if you're familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and met with the guy, the owner of
the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think his name's Ben?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got a lot of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're growing his auto and box out
there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got auto too at Green and Healthy,
that'll be coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got auto 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ours is auto 11, and I just read it
as...
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Roman numeral two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it's Roman numeral two and I'm
reading it as 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to ask them one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just call it auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's phenos in there that run
every which way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we still, we're running in mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't really release what we're running
in particular, but those are the strains
[SPEAKER_01]: we're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running in mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we know for certain is our 15% CBD
under 0.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually testing at 0.25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Percent THC right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other strains are pretty experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a good flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a good harvest off and then we'll
maybe propagate a couple of thousand and
[SPEAKER_01]: put them out into the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so everything, since we can't
grow for male or we can't have male
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, everything has to be taken from a
tested female.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lab test for that that you can
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually we, there are lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been working with, we used to
work with labs here in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, MED wanted to be a-holes
and come out and say that licensed or MED
[SPEAKER_01]: certified testing facilities are no longer
to test hemp, are allowed to test hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they have an excuse for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's because the tracking system
isn't implemented with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CDA is supposed to start
implementing the RD or the radio frequency
[SPEAKER_01]: tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So RDIF, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: RFIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to play with those every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're supposed to start issuing some
of those for us after harvest to get us
[SPEAKER_01]: into these testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day last summer,
basically they is at the end of this
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest season is when they kind of
implemented that law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was November.
[SPEAKER_01]: They quit and we couldn't test anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't really been able to test
since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we built our own facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we're building our own
testing facility on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be any need to go any outside
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are problem solvers, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, yeah, cut out the
middle, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Necessity is the mother of invention,
I think they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, the way it works is our
reg, our governing body, a regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: agency is the department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work with the Colorado department of
agriculture, issued us our permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very open with them, everything we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, we file harvest reports,
planning reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the way the compliance works,
but they test frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, but you know, it's sporadic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't announce when they come and
it's usually around harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a random drug test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is, is if they were to
come out and test my field and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as well as I do, the cannabinoid
count can fluctuate or change due to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a pest infestation or you get
prolonged periods of UV light,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you get a drought period, whatever
happens, but you can have exterior factors
[SPEAKER_01]: that can, you know, change the cannabinoid
count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this, if I have the CDA come in and
we're at 4%, 5% or 0.4, 0.5, I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy my crop.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.5 is your limit on THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3% is my limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything over 0.3 is, has to be
destroyed on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hate to have to see that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the, you know, we'll build our
own testing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we can test these things
periodically and make sure we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have that consistent product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with, we'll be doing our own
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can do our own in-house lab
testing, our own in-house homogenized
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we're releasing large batch
products, you know, everything's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's going to be the same grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's something that,
I really, I'm so fortunate to be a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: this organization because they believe the
same way I do that we will not skip,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, skip things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it becomes to health and it comes to
the purity of the products, we don't fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should see the look on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, big thanks and much respect for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've needed people to come to this
industry like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a lot of the new rules came into
play, a lot of money came into play and
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys with a lot of heart, like you and
I kind of got pushed away by the guys with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of money and a lot of backing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to see some heart coming back
into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good, you know, likewise,
man, it's good to see where you're at too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, is there a market for a feminized
hemp seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, the question is, is how do you
feminize your seed and is colloidal silver
[SPEAKER_01]: registered through the CDA?
[SPEAKER_01]: See if I have that blank stare back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask this before I asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, but no, the market's getting
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, that's something that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's interested in creating your
own seed stock and what farm isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in creating their own seed
stock, especially something, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the CBD industry is where the
MMJ industry was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is there's me and like six other
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think that six companies,
a lot, you've obviously never driven
[SPEAKER_01]: through Denver and seen the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six dispensaries on South
Broadway in two blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, man, that's a lot of information
in the first 12 minutes of a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I truly appreciate all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does that give him credibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, can I start asking questions
about stuff that we need advice on now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe him?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, uh, every time I see you,
you've gone 12 steps ahead of yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we brought you here for,
uh, is to actually talk about integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you're just burning a huge
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were telling me what you were doing
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to tell me about, uh,
you can start with the posting of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram picture and I'm going to just be
real with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause people run into problems and I ran
into some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just kind of go over what
happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what I used as treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then what we do now is weekly,
uh, preventative measures and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll kind of start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind you guys, this is in a
greenhouse and outdoor setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once he gets through with this,
I will ask questions about indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, well, yeah, this is, uh,
you can run this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, uh, everything that we're talking
about can be ran in an indoor environment
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, uh, you know, running in our
greenhouses, transplanting plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually just moved from an indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing in a small warehouse and
then moved everything into our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody out there is familiar with
greenhouse growing, uh, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't something that you can just
fire up, put plants into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, unfortunately investors don't see it
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business owners don't see it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we introduce plants as fast as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment isn't where it needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, there's just a lot of stresses
that are going on at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of goes to the first step in
integrative pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real dumb statement,
but, uh, healthy plants are less likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: get sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when you're saying that,
I really mean that, uh, if your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment's in good condition and your
water's in good condition and your light
[SPEAKER_01]: is good condition and it's like a report
card, if you're hitting A's and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things, if one fails, you're still
going to average out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need, we rely on this system,
uh, to catch us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're half ass and everything,
you're going to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stepped into this greenhouse,
not fully ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we half ass some things and we ran
into some problems and it's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not, I'm human, so we run into
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, uh, we ran in there running
into some environmental issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting them straightened out and
the plants weren't as healthy as they
[SPEAKER_01]: should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil was on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, feeding schedule,
everything was right where it should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, things were lagging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, plant growth was slowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were having some issues, couldn't
really figure out what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually posted some, uh,
I'll let you guys be the judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on my Instagram picture and see if
you're smart as these people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, see if you can't find the picture
that tipped them off to where I was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually contacted by dragon fly earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, shout out to Josh Kelly and sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are my saviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get them on the show,
even if it's through Skype or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, they're just pioneers at what
they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, really hope they're really helped the,
you know, influenced the way that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: setting my farm up for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but, uh, so they actually
contacted me and noticed that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we had some, uh, you know,
leaf curling the way that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: curling kind of some of the discoloration
problems that we were having.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and through a few other, you know,
things, they actually saw the pictures and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, Hey man, you have broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but before I could, uh, cry,
they had, uh, taken care of it and sent me
[SPEAKER_01]: over some predatorial mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with that, they actually sent me
a little IPM program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately, uh, you know, we were
going to implement these mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before, but before I implemented these
mites, uh, this is what we actually did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heat treated the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever heard of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have spider mites also,
uh, your plants can handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ours did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to have a lot more money
invested in mine than you do your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but a heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually, you can run your grow room
at about 120 degrees for about 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants will survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the spider mites won't, any bugs
won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to nuke a lot, any
beneficials or anything in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're going to sterilize your room to
a greater extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when coming back, you know,
so run it for 45 minutes, coming back off
[SPEAKER_01]: of that for the next 15 minutes,
no direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: To hit the leaf, no water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to slowly, you know,
cool your room back down, give it about 15
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes before you started introducing
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, there's actually a lot of
research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested, if this is
something that you're interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just go on Google, Google
greenhouse heat treatment, and then kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of go those steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, so that was first step,
hit them with the heat, burn those
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hit them with the heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, uh, dragon fly earth
medicine had sent me some, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had predatorial mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually sent me two different packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a, I believe it's a Schwarzsky and
Thripex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably pronouncing it all wrong,
but, uh, so two different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them can protect against the broad
mite.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, the Schwarzsky, I believe
it's called, protects against the russet,
[SPEAKER_01]: the spotted, the brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that one, the Schwarzsky is all spider
mite and the broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thripex is for thrips and white fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd also, uh, these predatory mites
also fight some, uh, broad mites and they
[SPEAKER_01]: feed off each other because they're
carnivorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we introduce them, takes about three
weeks for them to inoculate the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I start, like you guys run out
and you, you want to start trying this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this doesn't work in a synthetic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only works in an organic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot use, uh, you can't,
you certainly can't use any systemics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, don't go and spray things
that kill mites and put beneficial mites
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, second thing, don't use synthetic
nutrients because the thing is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is when you use synthetic nutrients,
you're bypassing natural processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, uh, feeding your plant through an
IV.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for protozoa, nematodes
and anthropods, because you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding it straight to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you bypass these natural
processes, what's happening is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you're not allowing the plant to build
its natural immune, like response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can keep it organic and you can
keep this biological system just in check
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole cycle, then when you
and your plant gets infected, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed, the plant itself can react to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant is, can fend off spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, if your plant couldn't,
then there would be way more spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: than there would be marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your plant can naturally fight off
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the problem is, is that in a synthetic
growing environment, especially indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant has no resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant has, it's a puss, grew up in a
plastic bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, and that's kind of the
same thing is that you, your plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't going to build any resistant if
you're feeding it space food the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it needs the, it needs to digest
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to chew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to, you know, work that whole
process out itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it's just going to become weak
and decrepit and have no defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at that point, what is your plant
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quick vegetative turnovers,
fast veg times and high yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all you're focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're focused on increasing leaf
surface area and increasing bud area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not worried about increasing root
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not worried about increasing,
you know, the, the Bricks County,
[SPEAKER_01]: your plan, you know, you're focusing on
the wrong things and there's a lot more to
[SPEAKER_01]: it than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you miss these things,
your plant, you know, can't defend itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to, I forgot to mention
that is this is for organic systems only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not running an organic
system, you're going to have to spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, unless you keep it completely clean,
you're going to have to keep a very clean
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in an outdoor system, something like
we're running in a greenhouse and an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor hybrid environment where you pull
in fresh air, not through a HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, we have shutter fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pull that outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it was seven degrees this morning,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants are a lot tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we give them credit for if they're
outside plants and they've been given
[SPEAKER_01]: even, you know, honestly, even indoors
plants are a lot tougher than we give them
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been growing for millions of years
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should give them a little bit more
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, they've been fighting for
themselves for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of the problems
that modern growers run into are because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the modern methods that they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the, you know, at my opinion,
this is, you know, just me speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's these synthetic systems and these
synthetic, uh, environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say synthetic environment,
I'm not meaning grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean in synthetic pesticides and,
you know, but, uh, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with these synthetic systems, that's
what's creating this influx, these super
[SPEAKER_01]: hardy spider mites, these crazy resistant
powdery mildew strains is because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a feeding, you know, Colorado is
a whole, is creating a feeding ground for
[SPEAKER_01]: pests and disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every single dispensary is
spraying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're spraying neem oil or,
you know, it's a very short list for a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of plants and they're not using
these biological controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't want to run into problems,
kick it, you know, start using organic
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, ASAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, you can,
these beneficial insects, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: something that are hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to your local hydro store,
go to topnotch.com, go to Copert,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to contact dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bug them enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get them for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you can get these mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't have to spray, you know,
we, you know, for example, we put these
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial mites out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we top dress with neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: We top dress with diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I foliar spray with natural mystic,
uh, which is a dragonfly earth medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like nettle, thistle,
horsetail, uh, lavender, patchoula,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, all sorts of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost take a bite out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I love to spray the greenhouse
with it, but you know, we spray natural
[SPEAKER_01]: mystic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, natural mystic barley and
earthworm cast or like a barley malted
[SPEAKER_01]: tea, you know, seed tea, seed sprouted
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, so barley natural mystic
earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a preventative, uh, that we were
foliar spraying with, um, natural mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworm castings and bacillus thurgenus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great for the, uh, the fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wiped out some gnats with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a lot of these things are
just the same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just different forms, different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, on a weekly basis,
we give them a weekly app of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural mystic, uh, Rocky Mount worm
castings and then sea crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trace minerals, natural mystic worm
castings weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that on top of just maintaining a
healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, like I was saying,
the key is to just maintain the biological
[SPEAKER_01]: immune response through the entire growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: No aesthetic nutrients, no pesticides,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bypassing natural processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put your plant in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that in exclamation points on both
sides of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would have known you were reading
anything if you didn't tell us that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just say it's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over the beneficials, bacillus
thurgenus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, the big thing with,
uh, integrative pest management,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, uh, maintaining a natural system is
going to be looking, scouting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stay observant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to maintain, you know,
the time when you notice a bug problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's too late.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, stay on top of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out for yellowing leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a reason sticky traps
are yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs are attracted to dying leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep all the yellow leaves out of your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a no-till gardener and you are,
somebody who top feeds with your leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top dress with, make sure you're top
dressing with Neem and Karaja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you do have beneficial
nematodes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you do treat with bacillus thurgenus
every now and then because otherwise
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to run into fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just need to be a little bit more
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got my fungus gnats,
trying to go no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it before too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, that's it, it is what it
is, but you know, you learn these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process and your plan will work
itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll, you'll, you'll end up
with different sprig tails and different,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, soil mites and shredders and
anthropods and it'll balance itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nature does its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You treat them, you know, you keep doing
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit them with your bacillus thurgenus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit them with some diatomaceous,
um, when you're so, my guys at work,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't fucking get this through their
heads, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diatomaceous doesn't work when it's
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love of God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be abrasive and rough.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also goes for right after you
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the soil is still wet,
don't put diatomaceous on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a hard time getting these guys to
put diatomaceous out correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to just education is
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know how to put your pest, you know,
or I say pesticide, but how to put your
[SPEAKER_01]: products out correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, the CD8 came by our
farm last week, but nothing on our farm is
[SPEAKER_01]: considered a pesticide or really even a
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, our diatomaceous earth is
bought as an anti-caking agent for animal
[SPEAKER_01]: feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use food grade aloe and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our neem and caranjas bought from,
you know, natural selects or Rocky Mount
[SPEAKER_01]: worm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's all food grade.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Jay only uses food grade
material for his worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm only getting food grade material
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know the patients are being
taken care of, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what you covered, you said
organic only, and then you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing synthetic nutrients,
you're going to have to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now here's where we're going to have to
talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dreaded, I'm going to have to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I walk in, and I see freaking
spider mites in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got a light infested infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never sprayed anything before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is something we can spray that's not
going to do too much damage biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: to my planet and also to me when I smoke
it and also not make my concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, your first go-to would obviously
be the neems, you know, uh, then the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that you'd want to do is throw down
a nice tea of some neem, caranja,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, earthworm castings, just right drench
into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, if you don't want to make it
to, you can top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we ran it at our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, we, and I say neem and caranja
it's because caranja is cheaper than neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can cut it 50 50 and save a good
bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, we cut, yeah, I'd cut those
in, uh, neem oil, wouldn't spray it after
[SPEAKER_01]: veg, obviously, uh, essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to just pay a whole bunch of
money, but S and S does kind of work.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if rosemary oil, yeah, they'll kill
spider mite eggs on contact and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: irritate, uh, the spider mites pushing
back a good bit and, uh, inhibit their
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essential oils, things like S and S 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like a huge fan of like ladybug
killer, red, Rosenthal zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't seen great, two good
results, but S and S I have, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 90, you know, it's like 9% rosemary
or 2% rosemary oil or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could make it if you feel like
being a little experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have cooked some plants before with
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're extremely volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, outside of that, I would go to a
biologicals, you know, would be my next
[SPEAKER_01]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I would step into the
predatorial mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, ladybugs ladybugs don't eat spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs eat larger insects like aphids,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the ladybug larva that eat
the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to bring them in and then give
them enough time to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: lower the lights, light some candles,
play some music, and then have them make
[SPEAKER_01]: babies all over your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need a little ladybug orgy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there you go, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just woodstock in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, their ladybugs, you know,
their larva will emerge a little alligator
[SPEAKER_01]: larva and then those elite, uh,
soft bodied insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, smaller soft bodied insects,
mites, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start implementing that system,
uh, defoliating, taking off the infected
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: People overlook that so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many times I've gone
to an infected garden and seen stippled
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and these things look just fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my first question is why
are these leaves still on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the spider mites are still
on your plants, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remove that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetation unless it's absolutely needed,
you know, and I'm learning a lot from
[SPEAKER_01]: plants running on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I am plants can take a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need to thin your plan out to
two tops from a fucking 12 top five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon, it's going to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if all you're trying to say,
and that's maybe something that you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to assess too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you fight, you walk into your
garden and you find the spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, which you, you know, maybe the
first thing that you really need to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: think about what is this plant's
intention?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it getting ready to be flowered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, can't I just kill it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you, is it too much right now for,
you know, if perfect world, I would tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you to throw the plant away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and maybe you can't,
maybe you're too far in, you've already
[SPEAKER_01]: got too much invested growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I'd say, you know,
neem oils and then the essential oils and
[SPEAKER_01]: the predator, you know, the predator oils
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you notice it's usually
too late unless you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: veg for another four weeks, cut her back,
take clones off of that and inoculate the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually what, what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I find something's too out of control,
if I, I do consulting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I go to someone's grow and I can
see that their mother plan or their veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plan has gotten too far, I just say take
clones, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kill, you know, bugs on clones and
get rid of those big ass plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: less vegetation, like you were saying
around to keep all those bugs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut some clones, clean the room,
start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your only option sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, and a lot of people
don't, they don't understand start fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: means get off your ass, scrub your room,
scrub, change your filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got paying to film, going by some new
roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you're not, you don't just pull your
plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, the spider mites got in there two
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got in there because you didn't
change your clothes and you walked into an
[SPEAKER_01]: effective garden and brought them in or
somebody, you know, brought them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the second option is they brought
themselves in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, have a agricultural
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in a cucumber, you know,
grown cucumbers, tomatoes, and Falcon up
[SPEAKER_01]: in Northern or Western or Eastern
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when we would do, I was in charge
of IPM there and we would do scouting
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every morning you would walk out with your
magnifying glass and your clipboard with
[SPEAKER_01]: your map of the greenhouse and it would
have your rows marked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would be surprised to see that,
you know, we would find stippling and we
[SPEAKER_01]: would mark them on the map as we found
stippling in these rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we would go through all these rows,
you could follow this map back to a
[SPEAKER_01]: cracked seal and the greenhouse to where
there was a broken, cause it was a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse to a broken pane where weeds
had grown through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, same thing in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that, uh, the spider mites
in the back corner of your room,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's not sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might have a draft back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's where your window is and you
put a piece of plywood over it with hand
[SPEAKER_01]: film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you thought that was going to be
enough to cover it and you didn't weather
[SPEAKER_01]: seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that is, you know, that's how
spider mites get into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, it's an evolutionary thing to want
to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Colorado, when it's four degrees
outside and you have a 90 or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 75 degree grow room, that's where I'm
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, fuck your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take vacation time in there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go snuggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been doing during this
winter is hiding in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you nailed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You nailed two things off the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had written down there is your
environment will contribute to your bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you bring those bugs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to cross off two things on the
list without even asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys, if you're going from grow to
grow, you're bringing something back with
[SPEAKER_00]: you every time you come and go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you really want to,
you can buy a lab coat and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I recommend to all of my
growers, every consultation, every,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do it at my, you know, we'll do it at
my work when we're not growing in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when we get back into a more of
an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, get a lab coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order them and get one for your
home grow and put it on every time you go
[SPEAKER_01]: in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang up on the outside, right by the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right next to your clipboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, buy yourself a grow room,
Tam, and then you don't wear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you saying that the dreadlocks
might carry something in?
[SPEAKER_00]: They might get caught in a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't keep them up, I have a hat
specifically for the grow and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you could probably collect a quarter
gram of hash off of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so sticky from walking through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, but that's the key
though is just the contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as not wearing the hoodie
that you were hiking in, into your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you laugh, but to a lot of
people it's, they don't think about that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of the guys at my work
probably go home to their gardens right
[SPEAKER_01]: after my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, do I worry about them bringing things
back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really because you know, they're an
indoor grow, bringing it to an outside
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, am I, you know, they should be really
fucking worried about bringing something
[SPEAKER_01]: home because if a spider might comes into
my garden, it's not going to like it very
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to jump onto your shirt and try
to come home with you and see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's, you know, everybody's
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time you go over to your
friend's house and his garden looks a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better than yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, change it before and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do him a favor too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go, don't be a dick and go visit
your friends grow after walking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or don't tell me, don't come to my grow
and be like, Oh, your plants are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fighting spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got spider mites, stay away from my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring your powdery mildew to my
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, and that's another
thing too, is that the powdery mildews,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not that you said that it's
traded, you know, so frequently back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth and within the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another one that when,
you know, when, when I say kill and start
[SPEAKER_01]: over, I mean, scorched earth, I mean,
burn it down to the ground and build her
[SPEAKER_01]: back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and honestly, when you,
your grow room should build, be built with
[SPEAKER_01]: that capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not rebuild your grow room
with either walls that you can clean with
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach or peroxide or whatever cleaning
agent, or maybe it's paying to film,
[SPEAKER_01]: but build it to where you can replace it
in a frequent basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you spray foam, insulation,
don't you shitty, you know, stuff wall
[SPEAKER_01]: insulation.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, you know, and if you can't afford,
you know, these nicer options,
[SPEAKER_01]: painted films, not expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you build the room, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really expensive if you
don't know what you're doing and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running it 15 times around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, build your rooms
correctly, make sure they're sealed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pay attention to what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's one of the main keys to
growing is a good room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you only get that one shot to
build it correct before you put your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Sean said, try to replace that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you're using Panda film,
that's not going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys take it down every like six
months, like every couple of harvests,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that shit down, clean behind it,
get the shop back out, clean out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners behind there where all that dust
built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many, like, especially
home grows I've been to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why people like to build
floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the weirdest thing to me,
but I don't know how many grow rooms I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been in where people have floors built up
just a couple of inches or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll have Panda film rolled out on top
of concrete for extra reflective.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just creating more space for bugs,
pests, mildew and problems like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less is more in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can hold temp and you, you know,
don't need to cover your floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, you're growing in your
garage, utilize that concrete floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, you know, it's nice, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be cleaned easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, drop you some two by fours and
caulk it to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get some great stuff foam, insulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bugs are going to crawl through that,
but just little steps through,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's what's going to prevent,
you know, for you from having a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you said, once you see it,
it's probably too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that people are probably
not aware of, especially if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower, you just got to start
pulling off leaves and write it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you how many times I've
had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, it's in spider mites can be
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be, you can get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end of the world and you
don't have to kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but like you said, if you,
if you're getting ready to go into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and you see stippling, don't flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because when you find yourself
with that decision of like, Oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I going to have to spray a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four with neem oil, you're going to have
to spray a week for neem oil because you
[SPEAKER_00]: put yourself in that position because by
week six, you're just going to have crispy
[SPEAKER_00]: ass leaves and no bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, but like, you know,
but what was worse is, or even if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: a week into flower, what would have been
worse reverting back to veg or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, holding onto this spider mite
infestation and having to write it through
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially losing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another month of power bills versus
losing your entire heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you got to weigh your
options out and that goes back to really
[SPEAKER_01]: think about your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these plants for?
[SPEAKER_00]: True that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing your own personal medicine
or you got a crop out there that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make some bank on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to buy that new car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it somebody else's money?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's a, that's a stress
that people don't realize exists out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, we, me and you both,
we grow personally and stuff, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: manage other people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our gardens, but it's other people's
money.
Ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else's chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do in that situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do you, as a grower come to
the decision of to coal a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, yeah, I mean, that's the,
that's the daily decisions that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can do it, you can do it at your
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but that's what you really get.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have to start thinking about things
a lot differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meet a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what can you spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what should I have sprayed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you should be spraying ahead
of time, stay on top of these foliar,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do compost tea foliar sprays on a
regular basis, along with beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects, mites, nematodes, you know,
top dress with diatomaceous earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see you having a pest problem,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in my greenhouse, you know,
like I was saying, we thought that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: a broad mite infestation actually turned
out that it was another problem was a
[SPEAKER_01]: water issue because our well had
collapsed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had brought water from another well at
a different location and did the very
[SPEAKER_01]: foolish thing of not fully checking the
water's chemistry before we ran it through
[SPEAKER_01]: an RO, ended up putting high levels of
salt in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a firm believer that it was the
soil, the environment and the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that natural immune response that
pushed me out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if I was in cocoa grown with
mills and I put that much salt on my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, it would have been over the
instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been like a pepper spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been screaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wrote it out and you can go to my
Instagram, you know, or go to Sansa CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram and look at this greenhouse
filled with just beautiful greenery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was 3000 square foot of just
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lush canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was checking out your security cameras
earlier and that shit looks good,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and organized, super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing you guys,
you don't need shit in your grow room that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need to be in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep your, your broom and your dust
pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your gloves, take those out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hat, take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that extra crap needs to be in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the only accessory I see that you
could use in there is a little iPod dock
[SPEAKER_00]: so you could jam some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, DeWalt makes an amazing
grow room radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a, yeah, you go to Lowe's and
they're like 90 bucks, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluetooth and waterproof and kick proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I'm punting my shit across the
room all the time, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, yeah, they, the little, uh,
the little Bluetooth speaker at the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely gets abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets shit spilled on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: DeWalt that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys big shout out to Lowe's and
DeWalt for their iPod dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the little things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, make yourself comfortable in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are only gonna be as happy as
you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're misery, you know, if you go into
your grow room and you're looking at it as
[SPEAKER_01]: work and you're, and you think of it as I
got to get in here, I got to check these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and I got to hurry up and water so
I can get out of here and I can go and do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and quit growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you're going to run into
these, you're going to miss the stippling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause you're not going to have
stippling if you're staying on top of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're checking your environment on a
regular basis and you know that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: air leaks or, you know, uh, ventilation
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're staying on top of your
maintenance and you're pulling your yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and you're cleaning up the inside
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got the, you know, airflow and
you don't have to worry about the mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met with the guy today, uh, was telling
me that, uh, one of their greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: offices, they've got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is February 3rd in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was four degrees with like 0% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these motherfuckers got powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were growing with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't clean their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was operator air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not plant air, you know,
these, and that's something that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: blame yourself and don't blame other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's really not the way to view a
pest problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you should always view it as what can
you do to improve it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your buddy gives you spider mites,
don't punch him in the face because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with the problems too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but now, you know, if honestly
though, if you get spider mites from your
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy, then you're kind of a dumb ass for
bringing a plant in without checking it
[SPEAKER_01]: for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to you just being
educated enough to identify what stippling
[SPEAKER_01]: is, to know what spider mite eggs look
like, to know how to use a magnifying
[SPEAKER_01]: glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, there's so much information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when me and you were learning,
we had to buy books, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going to Barnes and Nobles,
like trying to buy, you know, books about
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a difficult experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to ask for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays I can go to 50 different
webs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can Google everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drive down the street and absorb
massive information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing is just, I don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be running into these
problems with all of this information
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resources are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Dragonfly earth medicine, Rocky
mountain earthworm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys come through for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time and time again, uh, Jace castings,
not just as castings, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: aloe, cocoa, sea crop, OG bio are,
uh, earth kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This everything that we can source through
him, uh, neem, Karanja kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always hooking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Dragonfly the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, you know, the same thing,
follow us on our farm, sansal CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: me at King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm not afraid to tell you I got
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll post that if I get powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we were dealing with algae
blooms on our root rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had algae growing on root riot plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because the temperature
fluctuation, our air temp was staying warm
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, but the cube temp was dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, they don't make thermometers to
check cube temp, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we were basically keeping the cubes too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, uh, our, so when we cloned,
we'll do like, uh, aloe, cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I'm sorry, aloe, pro tech and full
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll usually follow your spray
with like a seed crop or a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically we had some nutrient content
and the plants wouldn't take it because
[SPEAKER_01]: roots never developed because it was too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants didn't die, but, uh,
you know, there was nutrient content,
[SPEAKER_01]: excess sunlight, algae bloom, you know,
but yeah, you just got to live and you
[SPEAKER_01]: learn man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had a little pond happening.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some koi fish in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we now we're running easy
cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout us through the easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but indoors in micro room at
three, you know, anywhere else that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: run it, we do the same cloning method over
and over again, hitting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 90%, you know, clone rates, bring him into
this greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have clones that aren't dead,
aren't rooted, still green and lush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were taken almost a month ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I haven't thrown them is
because I'm really anxious to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to live or die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plants like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken clones off of from like clones
that I took with, you know, I took that
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, you know, roll with the punches,
you know, information is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, preventative is key or preventative is
key and information is a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preventative is know what you're doing and
don't, don't go and concede it and cocky
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know what you're doing,
but really do your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend some time, you know, looking at what
spider mites looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hear that your friend has spider
mites, um, go and for the love of God,
[SPEAKER_01]: find an old t-shirt or something,
but volunteer to go over to his house with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look and see what the spider mite damage
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're not going to know,
unless you look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, but that's what I think is so
important is the education is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can become familiar with
stippling, you can become familiar with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus, you know, the difference between a
fungus net and a flying root aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can become familiar with a thrip or
a white fly, you know, then people,
[SPEAKER_01]: these small time guys aren't familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, me and you run into it cause
we're growing hundreds and thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, when you're in your home grow and
you run into these problems and you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens, but you stop, you know,
evaluate the situation and don't panic.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't run down to the grow store
and buy a chemical and spray your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never used a synthetic,
you know, nutrient, if you haven't,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I mean, even if you have, so if,
as long as you haven't sprayed those
[SPEAKER_01]: systemics is really the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're in veg and you hit it with
some advanced newts or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, stop going, hit it with the
compost tea top dress with some earthworm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, try to kickstart that biological
system, implement some beneficials,
[SPEAKER_01]: start full your spring and then just ride
it out like nature intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants, the bugs will leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll jump on your buddies and get into
their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run out of the bottom of the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I would be as experienced
of a gardener and in the position I am in
[SPEAKER_00]: if I did not fuck up a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I learned the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how humans learn the most
is by making huge mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more mistakes we make, the more we're
able to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accept your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you see some bugs in there,
it's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't cause that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to admit you got
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might all learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to come on a podcast and
talk about it one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for almost an hour here,
but dude, thank you for coming.

out there.

dropped.

on the podcast page.

my podcast being related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not want to let me take donations
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have suspended my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_00]: My account is frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't access my funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot take in any more funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will contact them and I will see if I
can fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said they tried to donate to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why you cannot donate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the webmaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Tony is the webmaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also a college student.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been a little tied up.

for me, unless I can convince PayPal to
[SPEAKER_00]: let me accept some donations.
