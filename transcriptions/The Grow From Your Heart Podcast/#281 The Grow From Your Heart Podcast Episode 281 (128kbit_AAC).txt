[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 281 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross DeGette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am smoking on some Garden of
Weedon Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at the Garden of Weedon have
got their products on store shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Doctor's Orders on the south
side of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Doctor's Orders STEM Beach and I
picked myself up some Clementine Live
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually Clementine Live Sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Clementine batter and I've
got some Sour Diesel batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a really cool Garden of Weedon
logo on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice Clementine description.
[SPEAKER_00]: 739 milligrams per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got some CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got some info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says GardenOfWeedon.com and then
their Instagram at GardenOfWeedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little tiny jar inside of it
which contains the actual concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clear jar with a black lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we've got the cool ass Garden
Of Weedon logo on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Garden Of
Weedon for getting their products on store
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only been back in Colorado for a
short time so to see them getting their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff available is impressive and it makes
me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the hash is high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Clementine gets me high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Garden Of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends over at Doctor's
Orders STEM Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Matty?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Bree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's move forward with this
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep you guys updated on my
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am breeding some new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, of course, I used in a rise male
and I put the pollen on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several girls in there but the
ones I've been talking a lot about are the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog and the Durban Poison and the
Platinum Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be done in sometime around 10 to
15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep checking on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're close, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to time seeds kind of perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm looking for and they are
almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite there yet but they're
very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breeding project is almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have Stardog to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have Durban Poison to arise,
Platinum Tangy to arise, and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: other great things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making more of old things that I sell
out of at the Hela Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be some refreshers coming and
some brand new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to talk about is,
since I'm talking about breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, in 2018, I am going to remake
the Lemon Jeffrey Feminize Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means while I'm at it, I will remake
the Golden Goat Feminize Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people think I created
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not create Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Golden Goat early on when it was
really popular in the Colorado dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went around like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed myself a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized how much I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me big fat weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some great photos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photos got passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody saw them on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started breeding to the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I made Golden Goat Feminize Seeds and
put those out available through an old
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everybody thought I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy by the name of Mr. Dank actually
made the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just known for growing the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Femseeds of it and passed them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not create it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me not take credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the Golden Goat reversed pollen and
put that on the female Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made Lemon Jeffrey Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one I did make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make more Golden Goat seeds
and I'm going to make more Lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably there will be one run between the
breeding project that's wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there'll be a run between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's when I plan on doing the
Golden Goat Lemon Skunk cross again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be this year, but it will be quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other projects in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a schedule of things that I want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got things lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones are already cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little baby plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's in motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to keep the wheels turning
or things will fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't rush things, but it will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will come in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey, let me mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't heard about the Lemon
Jeffrey, that's Lemon Skunk to Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has made some pretty impressive tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen very high 20s and low 30s
consistently from the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part is the concentrates that
it makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes live resin that tastes like lemon
candy and it is so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly one of my top three most
proud strains that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me on Instagram live what
my proudest strains are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In no particular order, Arise,
Grateful Dog, and Lemon Jeffrey would be
[SPEAKER_00]: my three favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeff is up there and it's
currently unavailable in seed form
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get some over at the Hela
Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get them laced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got an email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like reading emails and helping
people out because then I know I'm hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: my target audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody out there that's going to
get very useful information from this
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if one person has this
problem, a lot of people possibly have
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem and they just have not
emailed me to ask about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to email me, I encourage you
to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may read your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get through all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of emails, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to say your name on the
show, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want me to say your name,
just say, hey, my name is this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't say it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll do my best to be respectful with
your name and not blast it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I should preface this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy sent me an email asking if it was
in fact the real Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't sure if he had the correct email
address, so I replied with, this is in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact the real Rasta Jeff and I look
forward to your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, oh dude, I am so stoked you
answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take me a little while,
but I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said, I'm so sorry for the weird
first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in prohibition land and I'm super
paranoid about sending grow questions to
[SPEAKER_00]: an email address I've never messaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good work being careful, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a good job there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I have a million questions
and literally no one around me to bounce
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas or thoughts off of and that's
exactly what caused me to come across your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, thank you, man, so much for
doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing and I'm glad that I'm
able to help somebody who feels like they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have anybody else to turn to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of part of what my mission
was, so I'm glad to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, I've been
listening to you and the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen in every day at work as well as
when I'm in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I love that the Dude Grows show and
myself share such a cool audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the community that works around
both of our shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool and I like going to the
Dude Grows cup and I like those guys a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually working on learning how to
run Skype through my audio system and get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything dialed in so that I can do a
group chat and do a podcast with the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just gets overwhelmed and busy
and it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps on and he says, because of your
format, you can literally listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same podcast multiple times and still be
entertaining and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can barely listen back to it the time
that I have to edit it and it drives me
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts, so I'm glad that you're able to
listen multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool and it keeps you
entertained more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience Growers are celebrities and
superheroes to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, wow, that's cool that you think we
are celebrities and superheroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to Colorado sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Colorado kind of shut down all the
cool ass events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go to California now,
which California may fuck up all the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: events too now that they've changed all
their rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to one of the weed events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just come to a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an expo here a couple shits next
weekend in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this comes out, it will be
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Expo is the Saturday after this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only go Sunday if you're part of
the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of weed celebrities will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think Experience Growers and
breeders and folks like that are
[SPEAKER_00]: superheroes and celebrities, a lot of
those folks will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to one of those events and you can
meet so many of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you're coming to an event
in Denver and I'll do my best to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can hang out and we'll get to meet some
of your heroes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure you meet at least a couple
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe send you home with some irie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running either critical or landish
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says funny story in parentheses,
but he also says full cocoa nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_00]: pHed at 5.9 in cocoa, DNA with cork and
seven gallon smart pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are two Mars Hydro lights,
140 watt lights, one Cree CXB 3590 at 58
[SPEAKER_00]: watts and two no name shit full spectrum
50 watt cobs with reflectors and lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cobs are circuits on board is what I
think that stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says I'm running a little extra
CO2 than ambient.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells me as a question, then he
describes his setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not sure which strain he's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either critical or landish.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says funny story there, which a really
easy story to imagine being a very
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced grower who has worked in
several grows and worked with dipshit
[SPEAKER_00]: helpers that have crossed labels and me
being too high on cross labels and which
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which clones are these?
[SPEAKER_00]: That story is not even funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how that shit goes, but he's got
one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running full cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is at 5.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing DNA with cork, the cocoa DNA
with cork and seven gallon smart pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he describes the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how far apart or how close
they are, but so far it seems like it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also he's enriching a little extra
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a pretty good overview of
what's going on in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's in there and we know how
much light's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I noticed just a few days after
switching to bloom, all of my fan leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: started turning yellow, all but the veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then would progressively turn more yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking CalMag issue, but the grow
store assured me there was a ton of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the newts and I shouldn't need the
supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me to up my pH to 6.3 to 6.4 and
it all should be well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, again, man, thanks for
responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you're very welcome for the
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink and I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to press pause for a second
and take a quick drink and moisten up my
[SPEAKER_00]: throat and also take a dab while I'm
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm doing that, I encourage you guys
to check out patreon.com slash grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to patreon.com slash grow from
your heart, all the information you need
[SPEAKER_00]: will be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide to contribute to Patreon,
there's a button that says become a
[SPEAKER_00]: patron, click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you all the information that
you need and I will greatly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, it is time for a
drink and a dab and I'll be right back to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated and heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Sour Joker high cannabinoid
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like little crystals in the jar
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little chunks of just THC madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 97% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the other hand, I have got
some orange ghost batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can find the label for the
orange ghost batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not set that one aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have the lab test on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the other one with the lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange ghost batter, 76% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a little bit of the orange ghost
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little softer and easier to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stick a little bit of that on the dabber
and then I take some of those high
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals
and stick those right inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take a big old fat dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cold night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frosty cold in Colorado, but I am
sweating here at the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super medicated and super sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a highly effective dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the crew at Apothecary for
wrecking me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend sent us an email asking why his
leaves were turning yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also sent me a picture and those leaves
are very pale and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about some things
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people at the grow store don't seem to
think it's a Cal Mag problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have something to do with the Cal
Mag, but it's more of a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those leaves don't have any
green to them, which is probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen problem from the picture you sent
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Google and you Google
cannabis leaf problems, it'll bring up a
[SPEAKER_00]: chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at that chart,
there are a couple that will fool you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll want to think it's sulfur or a zinc
deficiency, but the obvious one that it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like is a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you said that it started as soon
as you switched to flour, that gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: another hint at what could be going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom nutrients are very low in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant takes up 85 to 90% of its
nitrogen during its vegetative stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've switched to flour, which tells
me you've probably switched to your flour
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you read the bottles, there is an
NPK value printed on the front of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles and the N stands for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at your base nutrient and you
look at the nitrogen level of your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, it will be a much higher
nitrogen value than on the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first number, the N perhaps,
and I'm just making up numbers here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be seven on your veg nutrient,
and it'll be 0.5 on your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're dropping out the nitrogen as
soon as you switch to flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may be okay, but it looks like
it's not for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would mix in a little bit of the veg
nutrients with your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do 50% of the flowering nutrient and 50%
of the veg nutrient, and maybe that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be chasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to catch up with that
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already so far ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you'll be able to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's far gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider foliar feeding it with
some base nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main problem is a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would foliar feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pull off a lot of the bottom
leaves and a lot of the lower shit just so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the nutrients that it does get can be
moved around more useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't have 12 arms, it can make
two arms stronger, if that makes any
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think part of the problem that may
cause your yellowing may be low light
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about the LEDs that
you listed to have any idea what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, but low light conditions
could lead to what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low nutrients could lead to what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need more nutrients overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may be giving the plants too
much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be drowning in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH could be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said the pH is at 5.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at the grow store are completely
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should go to 6.3 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.3 to 6.5, somewhere in that range,
would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that if you put the pH
around 6.3 and started feeding with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more nitrogen, you'll start seeing
more productivity from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may start greening up on you,
but you're going to be chasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a battle the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I want to mention,
you said you are running a little extra
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 than ambient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're giving the plants more CO2,
which means they are growing more rapidly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they are going to want to eat
more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to run CO2, you're going
to have to use more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dial in the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in cocoa as described,
I would recommend every time you water
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant that it gets nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cocoa, I never give the plants plain
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always get nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always pH so I run a large commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one room, in the veg room, we can have
700 plants in veg at one time and I water
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, I pH that water to 6.3 and I
put nutrients in the water every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in three gallon pots of cocoa with
perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing in a large scale
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.3 and I feed nutrients every time and
I'm in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend for you and
it may help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in cocoa and you're not
feeding it nutrients almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, you're going to start to see
deficiencies because cocoa doesn't hang on
[SPEAKER_00]: to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all just runs right out of the bottom
of the plant with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the plant doesn't absorb,
it doesn't hang out for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: My official diagnosis is that's a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water with nutrients every time
you water that plant until you start
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pull off the leaves on the bottom
and the shit leaves that don't look good,
[SPEAKER_00]: any lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are branches that have little
tiny sucker branches coming off,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that bullshit off there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take off all the weak branches,
all the strong branches will be stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get more use of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clean up the bottom lollipop a
little extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off the bottom of the crap,
just the fluffy shit and just focus more
[SPEAKER_00]: on just a few tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a few winning branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can get six or eight winning
branches out of the tops and use those as
[SPEAKER_00]: your main winners and take all that bottom
crap off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you still have that big strong
root ball and it's able to cycle that much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, but it's only got to feed six
tops instead of a bunch of bullshit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out, get the nutrients
where you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A foliar feed could help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be watering too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that plant sitting on a cold floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I just thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on the floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that floor getting cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be pissing your root ball off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that plant sitting on the cold floor
and then you water it and it's sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: a saucer and then all of that water sits
in that saucer for however long and those
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are just sitting there in cold
shitty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your hand in cold shitty water
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your toes in cold shitty water
overnight and see how much you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your leaves will turn yellow also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that I think may help
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're running CO2, you guys,
if you are enriching CO2, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging that plant to grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are turning that plant from a normal
performer, from a normal athlete into an
[SPEAKER_00]: MMA fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now giving it steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to feed it like it's on steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just give it a normal diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine right now if I didn't give you any
extra vitamins or nutrients and I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: just go run up hills until you pass out,
it's not going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give you more nutrients and I give
you a better meal plan and I say now go
[SPEAKER_00]: run until you pass out, you're going to be
able to run a little faster because you
[SPEAKER_00]: got the proper nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants need the proper nutrition when
you give them that CO2 steroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to enrich CO2 and make
them stronger, you have to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger all the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I should mention here, if you're
going to feed CO2, with the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, you cannot stop feeding it CO2
because they're going to start eating like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting fed CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start growing like
they're getting fed CO2 and when you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that out, it's really going to confuse
them and they're going to start having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start growing odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing a big long cola,
they'll start doing these little like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bud here, a bud here, a bud here and it'll
never fit all the way together like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be a bunch of little popcorn
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll really fuck up your harvest weight
and it's kind of a waste of CO2 if you
[SPEAKER_00]: start using it and then you stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford to run CO2 through the
whole flowering cycle, I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: don't start until week three or maybe week
four or maybe even not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just running a home grow,
you can pull pretty good harvest without
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, but if you're going to run it,
run it all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendation and don't overdo
it because you can't overdo the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I have ranted and
rambled for a really long time for one
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy did not say if he wants me to use
his name or not and he's in prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to be respectful and not
even say his name, but dude, you know who
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got my respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try some of the corrections I recommended
if you'd like to or don't, but if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them, send me a message and let me
know what works for you and let me know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you agree with what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just interact with me on this and we'll
keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you guys want to email me,
if you've got cannabis growing questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got something to say,
if you want to ask me something,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've got something
else I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever grown some really good herb
and then you dried and cured it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike fucked up and left it open for too
long and it got all dry and crispy and you
[SPEAKER_00]: did not know what you were going to do
with this dry and crispy weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys don't panic if Mike leaves
your giant Tupperware dish with like four
[SPEAKER_00]: to six pounds worth of really top shelf
buds open for way too long because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned a pretty good trick that I feel
works to re-moisten these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people do a whole bunch of dumb
shit over the years and when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about re-moistening buds, a lot of you
experienced growers, you probably cringe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, but it's Colorado and I'm just
picking on Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't leave things open for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: He opened the container and in Colorado,
you can have buds that are nice and moist
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can open the container and by the
time you close it, those buds are too
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to keep things in within a
certain range, but sometimes shit gets out
[SPEAKER_00]: of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some buds dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have learned a good way to
re-moisten these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use, the classic is to
use some fruit or something, which that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a bad idea, but then you put that
fruit flavor into the cannabis and who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to grow good cannabis and then throw
some fruit in there and make it taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also other things you're
introducing to the cannabis as you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that may make it a little funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use Boveda packs or
Boveda packs or Humida packs, however you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little packets that you can order that
add moisture and add humidity to a
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do not like about those is they
leave a funky flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make your weed taste like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make your weed taste like the way a
Boveda pack smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess sometimes it would be better to
smoke some moist weed that kind of tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Boveda pack than to smoke some
dusty ass weed that you rolled into a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and it all just falls apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way you fucked up and I found a
better way to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Mike and I did we use a Tupperware
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Rubbermaid bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Rubbermaid bin that's probably
about the size of a laundry bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're gonna put your dirty
laundry in a thing and take it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: laundry mat or down to the laundry room,
it's like the size of that laundry basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe a little bit bigger than that,
but you can fit a bunch of clothes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we use at the commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take all the leaves off of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut down the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut it into small pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we skipped a step here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut it into smaller pieces and then we
put it into these Rubbermaid bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's when the problems start
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those Rubbermaid bins aren't
completely sealed and they get too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned that I can take not even a
handful, just a few leaves from a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to a flowering room and just pull a
few leaves off of a fresh plant and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: those leaves into that Rubbermaid bin and
close it up for four, six, maybe eight
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those fresh leaves contain so much
moisture that they re-moisten your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis buds and the best part is it
still tastes like cannabis because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting a cannabis leaf in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bricks level is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just spreading the same moisture
around and I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be cute and put like a
handful of leaves in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those laundry basket sized Rubbermaid
bins, I think four to five, maybe six or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight leaves is plenty to put in there to
re-moisten some pretty dry buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a jar of weed that went
too dry, maybe a couple of little leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one decent size leaf in your jar
would be enough to re-moisten your dried
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit using wet paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit using a Q-tip with water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit using a cotton ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do something,
if you can, use a fresh leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut a leaf off, put it right into the jar,
seal the jar up, pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get too wet in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it starts getting moist, take that
leaf out, leave it open long enough for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to get right to the perfect dryness and
seal that bitch back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keep checking on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you didn't over-moisten it
because the moisture is inside also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture is going to work its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got some dry and crispy buds,
maybe that's a way you can return them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper moisture level.
