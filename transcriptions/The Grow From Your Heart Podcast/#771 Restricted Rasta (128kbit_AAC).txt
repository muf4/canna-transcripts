[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't seen it, go check it out at
patreon.com forward slash grow from your

[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a big thank you shout
out to everybody who has grabbed an iRegen
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirt off of the merch store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to everybody who has
pre-ordered a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the merch store, we are offering a
pre-sale for the iRegenetics logo hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very comfortable black hoodie with
the iRecross logo on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, iRegenetics.com,
there's a link to the merch store when you
[SPEAKER_00]: click on there that will take you to the
hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pre-order them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will ship the first of next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am currently accepting pre-orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to accept those pre-orders until
about halfway through the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will place the order for the
hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company I work with takes about two
weeks to produce the hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will print them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get them shipped to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will get them out to you as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the day that they arrive on my
porch or the next day, I will get them
[SPEAKER_00]: right back out to the people who have
pre-ordered those hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without any more rambling, please do go
check out iRegenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the merch tab, pre-order a
hoodie, grab a shirt that is in stock now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to filling your order.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to harvest, part of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that I've been breeding in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not talk about the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep it secretive because that's
just shit that I've learned along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm ready to tell you about it now
because it has been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that those plants have been
harvested, they're in a secure place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel much more comfortable talking
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about what we bred
this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did use a Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you've been following along,
you know that I do have a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: male that I really enjoy the way that he
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very fond of the outcome that comes
from that Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the Blueberry Butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the Convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the Jack the Ripper F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the Dog Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great stuff coming from
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that Jack the Ripper male and I
put him outside and I pollinated 10
[SPEAKER_00]: females in Colorado in a grow space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were allowed up to 12 plants in most
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have six of your recreational
plants, six medical plants, that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put 12 plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put two clones of the Jack the Ripper
male out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same male, just two copies of him to
make sure to get plenty of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put 10 female plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pollinated all 10 of them very
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the plants
that were out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to leave some to the imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make more Blueberry Butcher seeds
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be more Blueberry Butcher
seeds coming very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were made in the greenhouse this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did cross the Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts Creek Congo, the Vision Maker
Congo has been pollinated by the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should make some extremely potent,
really sativa dominant head buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of paranoia, panic attack,
euphoric, talk too much kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I expect from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Congo did not like being outdoors or
in the greenhouse in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not react as well as it does
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors that plant gets taller than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a monstrous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put it outdoors, it kind of stalled
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, nah, I don't think I'm going
to grow like I normally do, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still got plenty of seeds from that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of seeds to play with,
a lot of seeds to sift through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will have fun with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I made more of the Platinum
Tangy 2 Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a very small plant to play with,
ran a few testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw great success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did make a whole batch of Platinum
Tangy 2 Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had a Golden Goat pollinated by
Jack the Ripper, and that Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: produced a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Golden Goat plant did amazingly well
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum Tangy and the Golden Goat
both did very, very well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made more Jack the Ripper F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much else I want to tell
you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the P91 with Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we're going to talk about for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I made a bunch of great stuff with the
Jack the Ripper outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about depending on the
environment, the room, and honestly how
[SPEAKER_00]: often I get to mess with it, it takes
about 10 to 14 days for those plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them dry really, really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're super bone dry and crispy,
I'll remove all the stems, and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start crushing it up with my hands and
gloves and just crunching it up into
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a fine dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're just going to roll a
big old fatty or a bunch of blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an entire eight foot tall plant
worth of material just in a bin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just crush it up until it's dust
with my gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a machine that I pour
that material into, and it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: separates the material and the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need about 10 to 14 days to get it
dry, a day or two to get it all crushed
[SPEAKER_00]: up, and then a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me a while to run all these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of material and a lot of plants
to work through to run that all through
[SPEAKER_00]: the separator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got to go all through the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's all got to go out to testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little bit before a
lot of this is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure right now my tester inbox is
going to start blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them to me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to contact me about a
tester, if you're interested in testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Include pictures of your grow and your
address when you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me all your testing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to test the new shit that came
out of the greenhouse, a lot of it will
[SPEAKER_00]: get put in as freebies in upcoming orders
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my fall harvest report for
2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was a great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of seeds, a lot of great
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the people who helped me
out with the greenhouse space,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that were out there early in
the morning, sometimes late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the person that had to
hang a light they did not expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't expect to hang in a high space
in a precarious position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, you guys did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a great year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have more stuff to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have noticed that my content was a
little bit weird on the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to tread lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is on, they're basically on the
rampage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shutting down a lot of the
cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The educators that are out here talking
about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grow Show has been completely
shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newby Nugs' page is completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of our other friends have lost their
YouTube pages simply for posting cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about supporting, condoning,
and educating about our favorite plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least my favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's probably most of our
favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to you, Monstera nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But YouTube has been on the rampage,
taking down content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to tread lightly because
I have gotten a couple of YouTube strikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, they gave me a warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they gave me another strike and they
said, you can't post for five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they said, if you get one,
one more strike this month, we will take
[SPEAKER_00]: down your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to not post for the rest of
that month so that I did not get more
[SPEAKER_00]: strikes on fresh content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that they are striking old
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 770 episodes before this episode
and they keep finding problems with old
[SPEAKER_00]: content, like in the hundreds,
like 100, 200, 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're finding just random episodes,
flagging it, giving me community
[SPEAKER_00]: violations for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, my content has been
deemed harmful and or dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm just sitting here talking and
unless my voice is that powerful that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sparking some sort of revolution,
we are not harmful or dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm teaching people how to help themselves
with a medical product to ease and improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at, we can see half naked
women.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see beer ads and boner pills all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you try to promote the plant that
we love, that's harmful and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it, but I don't agree with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little rant that I'm gonna
just skip my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna leave a note where I am and
then, all right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little rant that I've kind of
half done on a couple of other podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to save the big part for this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I feel is going on with
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, let me say I understand it,
but I do not agree with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what I feel is happening with
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any research, so I don't have
an actual number.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is a billion dollar company,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a multi-million, possibly a
multi-billion dollar company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of income, a lot of
interaction, a lot of support with the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody on the planet knows what YouTube
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has seen a YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I learn a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I teach a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know YouTube, so YouTube is
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that own and work at YouTube,
like having a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like knowing that paycheck is coming
in every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why they are messing with
cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say it's legal in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's not legal in some other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with this, but I'm just
speaking on general why I feel like this
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my understanding to make sort
of an explanation of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to get involved in any
sort of legal battle, court case,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that would tarnish their income,
anything that would tarnish their
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation, anything that would tarnish
their revenue stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothetically, this could work this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody were to learn something
illegal off of YouTube, and they practiced
[SPEAKER_00]: that illegal practice and got in trouble
for it, and they said, I learned it on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, guess who could be an accessory?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be implemented in that crime
because that person may not have committed
[SPEAKER_00]: that crime without the help of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And YouTube doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube doesn't want to go to court.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube doesn't want the press for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube doesn't want to be involved in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for YouTube, but I am a
company owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in free speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely believe that we should be
able to say what we want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also believe that there will be
repercussions and consequences for what I
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say something completely terrible to
somebody, I wouldn't be too surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be surprised if they punched me
right in the fucking mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how life goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got freedom of speech, but we've
also got expectation of consequences,
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility of words and action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is part of being a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe in freedom of speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot go to my Discord server and
start dropping racial or homophobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can't come in and talk,
you can't talk about terroristic
[SPEAKER_00]: activities on my Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not allow that because that is very
off-brand for what I support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come in my Discord server and
we'll talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about life, love, all the good
shit, but we're not going to do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to hurt anybody's
feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to attack anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that sort of shit in my Discord,
I will shut you down immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll warn you one time based on what you
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're dropping N-bombs and F-bombs in
there, you know the F-bomb I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you can't say those words in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even the R-word in the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say something like,
hey bro, you can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it another time, we're just
going to block you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going to remember you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that because I'm supporting a
community that I want to be a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want hatred there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to support my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my face on it, my company name on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the N-word, the F-word,
and the R-word involved in my community
[SPEAKER_00]: and my company at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't condone that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to say that,
you're not part of our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not here for what we're trying to
do and you should go play over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get your shit figured out,
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may let you hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're acting like that,
we don't want you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my server, I do practice censorship
and it is because I don't want bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want terroristic activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want racism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want homophobia on my Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely make any money compared to
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a business that does generate
revenue, but compared to YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube's got however many people watch
all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the money that YouTube is bringing
in and imagine why they don't want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that to core law enforcement or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really does sound crazy, but think
about if two people are in an alley and
[SPEAKER_00]: one person says, hey, can you find drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other guy says, I don't have
drugs, but person number three has drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of those persons gets caught
selling or buying or carrying those drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes down wrong, all three of those
people are going to jail for that drug
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction because person two facilitated
that transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube doesn't want to be person two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be careful with what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here's where I'm headed to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose my YouTube channel
for saying something stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably risking a lot by talking
about YouTube and censorship the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: I am right now, but that's part of my job
is to fucking speak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ganja soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this since before cannabis
was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not brand new at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get mad that our YouTube channels
get taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Instagram accounts get shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, back in the day, they drove a tank up
my front yard, tied a chain to my front
[SPEAKER_00]: door, pulled the front door off my fucking
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dogs went running down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 cops came in, a flashbang went off,
fucking everybody dives on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut open every couch cushion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut open every pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut open the mattresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut open the speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dumped all of our food on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't find shit, but they swore
there was something in there that they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed and they were not stopping,
digging and destroying my house until they
[SPEAKER_00]: found that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays when they take away my discord
or my YouTube channel, it goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it fucking sucks, but they didn't
fucking pour all my food on my kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't tear my front door off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to rebuild my life and find
somewhere new to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause once that shit happens, the landlord
kicks you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to fucking live there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to live there anymore
anyway, but that shit doesn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not happening because we live in a
legal place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm, I'm okay with losing my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay with losing my YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose them, but there are
other options, other places to go if stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find other places to upload
the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that cannabis does support
podcast videos soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be posting my videos to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to upload those
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to try Vimeo and there was
another service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called rumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to try those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I disappear on YouTube, look for me
on Vimeo rumble and also on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the audio platform will always remain
because the RSS feeds are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, they don't even censor very
much on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to legalization so that we
don't have to be censored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to all of the entire nation
legalizing cannabis so that I can teach
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody without fear of my show,
my hard work, my dedication, part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: income being hindered because YouTube has
some silly rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, but I do not agree YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I want from you, what I need from
you is I need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do take me down on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention rumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Vimeo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are all the cool kids going to watch
videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going for cannabis content?
[SPEAKER_00]: What websites, what applications are you
using?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm a little bit out of the
loop because I'm so busy creating content
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to get it out that I don't
really have time to go discover the new
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a recommendation,
a suggestion where I can put the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can participate with the cannabis
community, I would love to join you
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever the cool kids are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll follow you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to know what magazines and
cannabis content you are consuming your
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabis education in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not videos, but what else are you
checking out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some new cannabis education,
cannabis content for myself to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, if they do shut me down on
any, every platform, keep rest assured,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to support cannabis, to teach you
guys how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to breed the best seeds that I
can offer you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if YouTube shuts me down,
if YouTube, Vimeo, Rumble, Cannabuzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they all shut me down, bro,
we'll invent our own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back stronger than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viva la revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can't be stopped, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're legalizing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do disappear, it's only going to
be temporary because you know that as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as they do legalize cannabis, they're
going to let all of us come back and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, do we want to come
back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they shut us all down, do we even want
to come back to YouTube?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've rambled on long enough about
this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if this episode will get
to stay up because of YouTube's scrutiny
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't give up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep making episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find some more to put them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep clicking like on the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sending me all the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment right down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment section is crazy lately,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love reading the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't answer all of them, but I do read
90% of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you people are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of percent of you are not so
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, the next episode,
I do plan on talking about phenohunting
[SPEAKER_00]: and selecting the phenotype for you and
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I've got for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a good time on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't talk too much about cannabis,
but I did get to rant and ramble a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, and that always feels good to me.
