[SPEAKER_00]: Get everybody on the same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share the show with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been asked a couple of questions
lately that we're going to start the show
[SPEAKER_00]: off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions saying,
hey, where can I find either your seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones, your flowers, or some sort of
iry genetics products and dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should give you a little recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I the host of The Grow From
Your Heart Podcast, I am also the owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: founder, sole proprietor, the head
motherfucker in charge of iry genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do run iry genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people see my Instagram posts,
my social media posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want my flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want clones and they want my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they ask, where do I get that stuff in
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, once I sell the seeds,
I don't know where they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what dispensary is
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seeds, my strains, my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't monitor the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't track the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that stuff goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what dispensary will
have what products in stock on the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know there are several commercial
recreational and medical dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout Colorado that do have my
clones, my plants in their grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't promise you when it will be on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to harvest it, dry it,
cure it, manifest it, transfer it over the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be there when you get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have no way of knowing what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, it's their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they've got the seeds, it is theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you guys have purchased the seeds,
you can ask me questions about how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it and whatnot, but those are your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you do have my blessing to breed
with the seeds that you get from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In exchange, give me credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you list the genetics on your pack,
at least put the proper strain name and
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe send me a 10 pack of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've read something, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure where to get flowers or
clones of my genetics in dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you cannot get my seeds in anywhere
in Colorado just because of the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado law is set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some boundaries there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend the online vendors for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a link to approximately
seven vendors on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be adding more shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just updating, checking emails,
getting all that stuff caught up,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what I can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't want to promise too many
vendors things that I cannot send to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds are available on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go to iregenetics.com,
maybe seedsherenow.com, maybe dankseed
[SPEAKER_00]: .store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website has a big list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will all have different stuff in
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be doing different deals,
different pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run their business how they would
like, but their websites are all linked up
[SPEAKER_00]: to my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds, you can get them on the
website, clones and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know where to tell you to get
clones or flowers or flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not ship you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not mail you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not meet you anywhere for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to use the apps that are
available to shop the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of apps you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the one you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in a strain name, look for a
dispensary where you are or where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going or in that area and see if it is
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that randomly I don't endorse any
specific dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happen to know that occasionally,
randomly a place called Trench Town has a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of iregenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not even tell you anything on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to check out the website or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know that you're 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you call the dispensary and you
say, do you have this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, we can't tell you over the
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because you've got to be 21 to shop
in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not 21, they're trying to
protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think they're being a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think they're being mean to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to keep our licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a million bucks for that license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to give it away by giving
dumb information over the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel like they're being
disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to cover their own ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to check a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Trench Town in Denver sometimes carries
my products, not my products, my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have acquired either seeds or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nothing to do with it after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have done their stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have Lemon Jeffrey at Trench Town
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check before you drive if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind Love sometimes has Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be sharing the same cut between
Trench Town and Trench Town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a long time ago, Three Rivers in
Pueblo had a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they've still got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have been removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have still be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at one point in time, it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check the website, check the apps,
all those services before you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other spots in Colorado that may
have my stuff, but really, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: where to tell you to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Michigan, I know my stuff is
available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in New Mexico, check out
Organtica.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a lot of my products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in New Mexico, check out
Everest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everest grew the shit out of some Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won Best Sativa in the Chronicle
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bud Bowl or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Sativa, first place, was Arise,
grown by Everest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is bugging my left eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make my eye twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in New Mexico, check out
Everest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the Arise quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of places across the
country have got my products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check the websites, check the
apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't rely on my advice because I'm
telling you straight up, I can't promise
[SPEAKER_00]: you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's like once I've sold the seed,
I don't know where that seed goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow it and you can do whatever
you want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take thousands of clones
from one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know where all of those clones
end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to follow up on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com should have a restock
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode drops,
there should be a restock at SeedsHereNow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were running very, very low on
iRegenetics products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that we let them get that low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing a website update.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing some inventory updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of in a holding position.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more holding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got them a restock.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
everything should be on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, a lot of the stuff will be
resold out and we will be restocking it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do our best to keep the
stock updated and in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things are honestly sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we're going to do our best to
keep things updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the low stock on seeds
here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you do use coupon code GFYH10
while checking out at SeedsHereNow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll save you 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may save you the cost of shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying multiple packs,
that may buy you another pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have a restock.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward to the main topics
of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This section of the show is brought to you
by my friend Billy Podunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Billy Podunk for
always supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to see you in the
Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of great messages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed some stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want their names said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Newby Nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Newby Nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a couple of things in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, first of all,
thank you for the amazing work you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only in your breeding, but also in the
knowledge you share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that those compliments are
like recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nutrients for my soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also says I've included a picture,
but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the picture here because I
can explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he explains the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm running auto flowers for this
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he does talk about the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, uh, so I filled this run with
some bag appeal, red and purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've been talking forever,
let's get into the question and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentals that you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did skip some stuff there, but it says
this is an auto flower named red poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from sweet seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know this breeder has many
strains bred for the sole purpose of being
[SPEAKER_00]: red or purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a breeder breeding for the
purpose of making a color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding, have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're starting out looking for color,
that's a great goal, a great purpose,
[SPEAKER_00]: great bag appeal that will make you stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you set three bags of herb on the
table and yours is fucking bright red or
[SPEAKER_00]: bright purple, someone's going to grab
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to buy that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're hitting the bag appeal on
nailing that one right on the are hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: that nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says these are almost five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I popped into the tent to make an
update for YouTube, I see that two of
[SPEAKER_00]: these babies are pre flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, they're just hitting pre
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols are barely poking out and the
color is wild and it's got exclamation
[SPEAKER_00]: points by the word color is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is, do you know what
causes this or the reason that plants make
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and how it spreads into the veins
of the leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had many purplish strains,
but, uh, this one looks like it is
[SPEAKER_00]: bleeding into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a chlorophyll type of chemical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then it says it could be genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he lists his environment,
which, uh, we don't need to go too much
[SPEAKER_00]: further because you've already answered
the question yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, uh, basically, uh, similar to
chlorophyll, but this is known as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to print that word out because I've
been saying it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been calling it anthos because I
wasn't sure how to say the last part,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've never had to say it out loud
before, honestly, until today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're seeing is anthocyanin is
basically the purple version of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the chlorophyll is what makes the
leaves green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanin is what is making that purple
reddish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other, uh, things have that
pigment is what we're going to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, carrots were actually purple when they
first started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives beats that color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from what I've read, uh,
they've got anthocyanin, uh, it's blue
[SPEAKER_00]: violet or a red flavonoid pigment found in
plants is the definition of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's easy, not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I guess it's easy to breed for that
because it's visually, uh, identifiable
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're breeding, when you're growing
plants, that is a very easy visual
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator to identify like potency pest
resistance, uh, hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all traits you've got to wait
and find out for hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see that, but you got to wait
that orange purple, different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very visual thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely breed for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can select for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find those very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if you're hitting your goal,
find a breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's hitting the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting plants with that many
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a successful breeding project
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, newbie nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you've got going on there is
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're hitting their goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bred for that red and purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for the great question,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more questions,
I do look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually came from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't generally answer questions from
the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to notice this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not that I'm ignoring the YouTube
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a content, uh, creator,
we are taught not to read a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments because, uh, the comments are
fucking where all the savagery happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comments are where the savagery
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sentence wasn't as hard to say as it
looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people aren't kind in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't give a shit in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't read a lot of them because we
just don't want to just why even delve
[SPEAKER_00]: into the negativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw this one pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got the email and it says just
like this, it's from our friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: big Mike from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says great show as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it says question, what are your
smoke test processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have created a new strain,
how long into curing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you have smoke testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you test the flowers only order the
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you wait for lab results?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you could
elaborate during a show for these
[SPEAKER_00]: important steps to choose for your
keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mention my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big Mike from Canada, big Mike from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your smoke test processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've created a new strain,
uh, basically chop it down, dry it and
[SPEAKER_00]: cure it and smoke it my favorite ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would roll a fat joint of it,
pack a bowl of it, pack a bong load of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how long into curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, generally I dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cure it for maybe a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not one of those guys that does the
ridiculously long cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary to go a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical process I'm looking for
happened in about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I need out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I start smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't wait that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you have smoke testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody around here loves to be a smoke
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I have to do is say, Hey, I got some
new herb and the couches will be full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people will invite me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get really popular when they know that
it is almost time to do some testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some phenotype selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, shout out to the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by the way, Doug, I miss you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get you back on the smoke
testing team.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still watch the show, got to get
you smoking again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, smoke testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the test crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is one of the number one testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's always up to me though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I'm the fucking head motherfucker in
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I decide that number six is the best
and other people said that number three
[SPEAKER_00]: was the best guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number six is the winner because I'm the
one that fucking I've got the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also know that that plan is going to
get bred to in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got other ulterior motives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, test crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a test crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's the next part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you test the flowers only or the
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on, uh, the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's somebody around that can make
concentrates for me, sometimes getting
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to make some diamonds for me to
make some sauce or batter is time
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does, uh, they do charge me for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's not enough product to
make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just grew a bunch of tiny,
tiny plants and we're just going to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers and see, because that's really
what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the flowers are no good, most of the
customers are going to smoke it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they buy seeds from me, most of them
are only going to smoke as a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a small percentage of them will
continue to make concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know most of what I make is going to
make amazing concentrates just because the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and the Terps that I've chosen for
my breeding palette always make great
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's available, if it's an option,
I do have concentrates made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wait for lab results?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are hyped up on lab
results and I've started to care less and
[SPEAKER_00]: less about lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've never had a high pressure liquid
chromatography machine buy seeds from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a fucking lab device smoke
weed with me and say that it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: good or really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke weed with machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow weed for test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow weed for fucking human results,
human consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who is going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I appreciate what the lab says,
but I'd rather hear what you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather hear what Mike's got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather hear what Doug's got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather hear what everybody in the
smoke circles got to say about it compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to what a fucking machine has to say about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machines are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing is cool, but what difference
does it make if I smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike smokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin smokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Matt smokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everybody smokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all say that sample number three is
the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lab tests show that sample number
six has higher numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what the lab test said?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all enjoyed number three better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the humans that are going to be
consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smoked a joint with a machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I fucking blew weed into a
machine at the bowling alley when it
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't fucking work right one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fixed that son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, um, I don't worry too much
about lab results and lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love seeing a high number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely, it works for marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the numbers are more for
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the numbers on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to buy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they see a higher number at the
dispensary, people just straight up say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your concentrate with the highest
THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those numbers are good for marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want, um, I want more Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the numbers super high in THC,
then where did the Terps go?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need just lower the THC and put some
Terps in there for me and I'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there is more for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you could
elaborate on this during a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I elaborated bro on these
important steps for choosing keepers,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, at choosing keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of it is the smoke report,
but a lot of it is how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, did it give me any problems,
any stress during the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think that it's got traits that it's
going to pass on in the offspring?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I breed to it that are going to give
you problems as a consumer, I want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you've got seeds that will be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my decision making in selection
is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you may not be the people purchasing
the seeds may not be as experienced of a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have thousands of hours,
thousands of crops under your belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be a commercial grower with
resources and space and fucking money for
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be the only pack of seeds you can
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be the first pack of seeds you
bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be your first and last run at
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do my best to select plants that I
know are going to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a good opportunity to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main goal as a seed producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do breed stuff that you never get,
uh, because it's kind of bred for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my secret stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of know that if I put like,
uh, some chem 91 and some old OG cush it
[SPEAKER_00]: together, there's an opportunity for
intersex traits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an opportunity for painting the
ass plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff won't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stays for me, but the stuff that I'm
breeding for you that I know is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be commercially viable that I know I want
to release to the masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that it's going to be
successful, uh, for the very beginner
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that the commercial
grower, the pro grower, that my crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends are going to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hit the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hit bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to eat fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get good concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I put out as my commercial
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's a part of my selection for
keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, uh, does it work well in my grow
because I'm the one growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep it in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it show me any problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, does it breed well with other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be able to breed well with
multiple different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe can I reverse it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That also helps me select a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I think my criteria for
selecting keepers may be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different than some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are just looking for
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are looking for something
that smokes well, smells good,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks good in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bottom line is, does it pay the bills?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, we're, we're growing for
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bottom line is a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my selection may be a little bit
different, but as the breeder creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: product for you, I understand your main
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me understanding your goal, providing a
product for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You to hit your goal helps out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, giant Mike, that was a big Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks for listening up there in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making sure I answered all of your
questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit all the points, the process,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll it up and smoke it, uh, roll a fat
joint because I want to taste the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to taste the flavor down at the
end, smoke it in a bowl because generally
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm smoking, uh, weed around the house,
uh, it's in a bowl because I like to pack
[SPEAKER_00]: a bowl and I just set it in my lap and
I'll hit it now and put it in my lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And walk around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't have nothing to do for a
couple of seconds, I just hit a bowl and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just carry it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to have weed in a pipe like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I don't have a lot of time getting
kind of older now, I hate to admit it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hitting a bong kind of hurts
sometimes, but I like to take a big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a lot of flavor, get a lot of
experience from that flower in a big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course make some concentrates
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how long do I cure it?
[SPEAKER_00]: My products doesn't, my products don't get
cured for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testers are the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I answered all of the points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big Mike, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got more questions,
please do send them my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if everybody out there, if you're not
already subscribed to the YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do click like and subscribe on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where this message came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave some comments on the YouTube channel
because that does make the show move up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that sort of stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm digging for the next message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're going to do this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a longer podcast than
I had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one came from our friend Jethro
Earl seven 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Jethro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
feel free to use my screen name.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read this on the show already done
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been listening to your
podcast for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say it's helped me get
through some long work days, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I listen to podcasts too when I'm
working and it does make a long day go
[SPEAKER_00]: quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I give it five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go rate it and review it wherever
you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was so excited to see you post
my pictures of orange Gazam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm posting your pictures, they must've
been beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to ask you to do a show
on photography for a while now,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some simple gear to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some tips to make better social media
posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put in my tester application and
right after you did that podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there anything I could do differently
to improve my channel?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just finishing up a run of orange
Gazam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now have strawberry starburst and veg,
blueberry butcher, and sonic boom coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then he gives us an email and then
his cannabis eyes, Jethro Earl seven 10 on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many signs it keep up the good work from
your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed it with his real name,
which we're going to leave out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to talk briefly about
cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that, I have got to tell you
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, straight up 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consider myself a photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got absolutely zero photography
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the numbers mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that stuff means on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the way I've learned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a camera, started turning the knobs,
turn one knob this way, take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and start turning the knob the
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it goes this way, I paid attention
to the changes in my photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I picked a different setting and set
it all the way at one end, started taking
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures, take a couple and switch the
settings this way as I go and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then learn how those two settings kind of
work with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I learned photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that is kind of how I learned
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been learning under the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a camera and I thought, I want to
take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started shooting pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went online immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: My photos got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was learning, I never stopped to like
take a class or learn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then I ended up doing a podcast,
ended up doing a video podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning the video production,
the same exact way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produce the shows, I edit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I'm producing and editing
them, I learned mistakes I made,
[SPEAKER_00]: corrections I can make, improvements I can
make as I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I learned photography,
video production, podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I learned cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did a lot of reading and research on
cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was, uh, completely passionate
about it, but photography just came,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kinda naturally to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to take pictures of
anything, but cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I can take pictures of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you sign up to be the photographer
at your wedding or at a birthday party,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be fucking mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I honestly, I just have a good eye
for the shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've looked at magazines long enough
to see what works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but honestly, I don't know what I'm
doing technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no schooling behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just, Hey, that's a good image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's catch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play with a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first things you said,
um, let's see, one of the first things you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know about some simple tips with
gear to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my photos are done with an iPhone
eight plus that is honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this eight plus, and I love it
for photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I also have a Canon, um, no,
it's the Nikon D 3,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain farted right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Nikon D 3,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of an older camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two lenses for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is close up and one is further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the further away lens and zoom in
really close and I get beautiful photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Nikon D 3,200, not a super
expensive camera, kind of an older camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I learned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I learned how to take photos
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff you see, uh,
from commercial grows that I post is with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nikon D 3,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, now it's a very affordable camera
cause it's kind of old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do not use the auto settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a couple of settings on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get, uh, your aperture setting,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your ISO setting, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn exactly how to shoot in a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so what I'm going to do is I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part about your
photography equipment, in my opinion is
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the tool you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an Android phone,
if you're using a Canon camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Nikon camera, a Sony camera,
learn that device.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you need a device that
is above your skill level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Sony, uh, which is this one,
the a 6,400.
[SPEAKER_00]: The a seven three would take a much better
photo, a much better video, but it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: so many buttons and so many settings that
I think it would just stumble me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would trip me up and confuse me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would help me to be productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the highest camera that I think I
could understand to be productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of years, once I understand
all these settings and tools and tricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will upgrade to that a seven three.
[SPEAKER_00]: By then there'll be something better out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the a fucking 22 five or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that one, but you see what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just get the best tool that you can
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a professional guitar player,
so I don't have fucking Les Paul guitars
[SPEAKER_00]: and amplifiers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a half ass guitar player.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a Yamaha acoustic on a stand
that's dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the best that you can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get something out of your league.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to intimidate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cameras can be confusing if you don't
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know what any of those
buttons and settings mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn all of that stuff on the
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I learned all of it on YouTube,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, no, the gear that you've got,
learn the gear that you've got the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about having the best gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about mastering the gear that you do
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then where are we going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do get a new camera, you're going
to think, Oh, I'm going to point this
[SPEAKER_00]: camera at the fucking plants and take a
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many settings to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about before that you're
going to have to figure out how to shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do this everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did this in some commercial
environments, the, uh, lead grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the owner would come and throw a fucking
fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the grow lights in my personal
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unplug the grow lights when I'm taking
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I turn on a fluorescent light and we
just got normal white lighting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 4,800 or the 48 K 4,800 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that color looks really good for
photography and for lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got going on right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are at 4,800 K is what I believe the
lighting in front of me is the one behind
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't judge me by that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did that for ambience behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two in front 4,800 K is where they
are set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a beautiful color for
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so just use a fluorescent light,
turn off the grow lights, use a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the more lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better, um, let's talk about the shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't matter how good your gear
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't frame a shot, if you don't,
can't get your subject, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to take a good photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think, look at what you're shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the subject, get the subject
in the shot and then don't have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra stuff in the shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can clean up the background,
I know we're, a lot of us are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't just move everything out of
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can move that plant in front of a
background, like this curtain behind me or
[SPEAKER_00]: a cool color or a contrasting color,
something that's not green.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put it in front of black or
purple or blue or something like that to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the greens and the reds pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it right against the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it about a foot off of the background
and lots of lighting, but think about
[SPEAKER_00]: what's behind that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to see like a bunch of crates
and five gallon buckets and maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to see all that dumb shit
in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see a beautiful, pleasing
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in the picture should be
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should catch my eye and make me go,
Ooh, that's a nice shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to see your pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all crusty and the floor that's
dirty and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a pleasant shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the goal of your shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to show me?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want me to see as the
photographer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your responsibility to show me what
you wanted me to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I've got is this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be there to say,
look at those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to look at those trichomes,
get those trichomes in the shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one picture is your opportunity to
tell me the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frame it the way you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it framed up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the shot you're looking at right now,
there's not a bunch of junk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background, not a bunch of junk in the
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do take a picture and there's a
bunch of shit on the sides of your
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, don't be afraid to crop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could trim out the sides of your
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like over here off camera, there's some
recording equipment you can't even see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think this room looks super clean and
organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's a mess right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even see it, but we just crop it
out and make it look super good and super
[SPEAKER_00]: professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has to know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make the shot pleasing, frame it,
have a good angle, have a good background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about good colors, colors that
contrast your plant, colors that
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to highlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to highlight the trichomes,
the colors, the leaf shape, the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to show me the whole plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get what you want in that shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step back, step forward, move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to move around in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll be in there hanging off of
a stepladder with one foot on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stepladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: One foot against the wall, leaning up
against the door, fucking precariously
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get these shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the shots you need, get in there,
take that shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it's time, when it's possible,
move that plant somewhere better so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put it in front of a good background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it about a foot off of the background,
put some good lighting on it, then start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting photos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, lighting, lighting, lighting is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more lighting, the better in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't add light to a photo once you
take a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the exposure a little bit,
but you can't add lighting to a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take lighting out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more lighting is fucking the better in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, lighting, lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light it from all angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can light it from the bottom up,
from the back forward, from the front
[SPEAKER_00]: back, the more lighting, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes out your shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes out all the weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later on when you learn photo
stacking, you've just got so many more
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going to talk about photo
stacking now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people who try to teach
me that, that I just simply don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: patience for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, but that's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You photographers are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, lighting, lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 4800 Kelvin lighting is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a light in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take a couple of pictures with your
flash and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple of pictures without the
flash and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to notice a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lighting is not right, the flash is
going to give you shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where that shadow lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust your lighting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two lights in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light behind me and a light behind me
for this recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light behind me separates me from my
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gives me a little bit of depth
when you put the plants to the background
[SPEAKER_00]: and a light between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll provide depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cut out a bunch of shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big photography secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a light behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty about photography now,
we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got memory cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, every photo costed you
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Costed money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is costed a word?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, every photo was an
expense because film wasn't free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every photo went onto a piece of film and
it had to be developed in a dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody had to go develop that film.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just fucking spray and pray and take a
bunch of shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the angle you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set your camera up where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your subject where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, we're just going to say that my
hand right here is my subject and my
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone is my camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple of shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop, chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the shot you want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now change the settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just change one or two settings a couple
of directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple more shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop, chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the setting a couple more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're going through later on
and looking at your photos, that one that
[SPEAKER_00]: shines for you, if you've got a good
camera, the settings will pop up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera and show you what settings you use
to take that photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's your chance to grab a pen and write
down those settings and duplicate those
[SPEAKER_00]: settings the next time you go into the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in there and change that setting
again or put your camera on auto and go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the room and take a couple of shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it's on auto, it's going to
adjust itself for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the setting you want and then mimic
that and play with it from there later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the macro mode on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one with the little tiny flower
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me nice and close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me some good close shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm backing up, I generally use that
portrait mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn your camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the funnest parts about cameras and
photography is there are no rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only rules are don't take pictures of
the wrong person at the wrong time and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get yourself in trouble,
you fucking creep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main part about photography,
there's no rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take pictures and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not hurting anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got the gear, the memory card
is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snap, snap, snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a bunch of shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delete the ones you don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, you'll get to where you can
just walk in and you can set up your
[SPEAKER_00]: camera and go, oh, look, there's the shot
that we need and you take two shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move over and you go, and you go,
thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was $10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay you 10 G's and you go back to
your studio and you edit a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things for a couple of seconds and you
send them their fucking pristine photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only took you two shots because you
knew exactly what you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You developed that photographer's eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just look at a shot and you go,
oh, that looks good right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that plant shines right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that leaf goes that direction in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this part of the plan in there and
kind of crop this part out because it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me want to see more and get just the
top of the bud in there and leave a little
[SPEAKER_00]: top for visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'll start seeing it and then
you'll learn the camera setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, oh, there's this much light in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get this much depth in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should use this lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll take two shots like a fucking
sniper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sniper gets one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want two angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're hitting two targets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shot, move over, shot again,
go home, make your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I am not a professional
photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't teach you what a professional
photographer does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not claim to be a professional photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is not what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a guy with a camera who's passionate
about cannabis, who wanted to share those
[SPEAKER_00]: photos with my friends and just learned
how to take pictures because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to make sure I answered the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use iPhone, Nikon,
and a can and some tips, uh, tips for
[SPEAKER_00]: better social media posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a little tiny square.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to show me in that
little tiny square?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at most of my photos,
I am a seed maker who is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight my seed brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you, uh, the colors,
the textures, the trichome level of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are coming from my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have a good, clear background
without a bunch of shit in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good, clear, solid posts that shows
you exactly what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I try to use somewhere between three
and five hashtags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the same hashtag too many
times, they'll start blocking that
[SPEAKER_00]: hashtag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll shadow ban it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rotate your hashtags, pick three or
five and stick with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, before you use those hashtags,
search them, see if they have been shadow
[SPEAKER_00]: banned or blocked because they're blocking
a lot of the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: popular hashtags on social media now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure they aren't blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've noticed that my stories get
viewed more than my posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe post in your stories,
post a post on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then share it to your story,
stories and posts with the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely get more views.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where are we with that tips for more
social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think that's what I've got for you
for the best social media posts put in my
[SPEAKER_00]: tester application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything I could do to improve my
chances right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking a break from selecting testers
because I've got, uh, uh, I'm in over my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot going on and I don't want to
commit to sending out a bunch of test
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to people right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got enough out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got enough going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I've got you written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now on my radar radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes time to selecting testers,
your name does look familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that does help you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, now I know that you're on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help out a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jethro Earl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a good question to ramble on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think honesty is the best policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a trained, educated, skilled
photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am just, I've, I'm an idiot with a
lot of experience to be quite honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just did it until I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I failed a few times, but the best part
about failing with photography is all you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do is delete a couple of photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wasted some space on a memory card,
a couple of flashes on the flash is all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, get experienced,
get in there and take pictures and then
[SPEAKER_00]: watch the settings that work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modify, repeat, uh, adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, dude, have fun with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been programmed and brainwashed
to make all of our posts look exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same for social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we scroll through social media,
it all looks basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little, we've all got the same
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a little, we're all,
we've all fallen into an algorithm
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally to make our photos pleasing
and appealing for social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get away from that and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take pictures of what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snap the images that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, that's the beauty of the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to capture what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's like playing an instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got drums, I didn't know how
to say what I was thinking on the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think, but now I could say,
and then I could say, well, how about on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can think it and play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, eventually you'll get the same way
with your camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, Ooh, I see that shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get lighting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get these colors on with this
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit these buttons, turn this knob,
zoom in, chip chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bro, thank you for the great question.
