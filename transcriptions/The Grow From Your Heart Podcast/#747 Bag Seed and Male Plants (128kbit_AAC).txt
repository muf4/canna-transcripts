[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 747 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of listener emails before we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few shout outs to a few of the

[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's wrap it all up with the Grow
From Your Heart podcast thank you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Orville Turner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends
to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of support, I want to thank
everybody for the words of support,
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement, the thank you, the
constructive criticism, the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback on the episode that I did about
never giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently did a podcast episode where
somebody sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they were frustrated with their
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were thinking about giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave some advice that my main advice was
focused on the grow room, but most of that
[SPEAKER_00]: advice was also applicable to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could apply most of what I said to
most situations in life to expand your
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, get better, move forward and
conquer obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great feedback on that
podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great emails, a lot of
YouTube comments, a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive criticism and positive
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great people listening
to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to take a moment and say thank
you for all of the encouragement,
[SPEAKER_00]: the words of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really meant a lot to me to read so
many positive words and so much great
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback on just a great episode that
honestly I didn't know was going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: such a big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I put out these shows,
I think the episode about cutting clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and like selecting males and female plants
and identifying sex and things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing sometimes when I'm just rambling
and saying things that I was just touching
[SPEAKER_00]: on a subject here, that's when really
people really seem to respond the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super cool to get such a great
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you once again, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do apologize for the throat
clearing dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't ramble on about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention previously that I did load
up a greenhouse with some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to say the plants are alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been very long since I put the
plants in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm recording this episode,
there is not much to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are spreading into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you caught it,
but I did say that the male plant I put
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the greenhouse was a Jack the
Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two Jack the Ripper male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clone of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put two of them in different places in
the gross strategically to work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow to get maximum pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're wondering the plants that are
in the greenhouse, the male is the Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, I will, of course, reveal some
of the females out there, let you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a Jack the Ripper male out there
in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the note that says everybody
looks happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants look super happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all I've got to report on
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did recently in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have appeared on another show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been on Caribou Heart TV where
I mentioned that I am now breeding with a
[SPEAKER_00]: new male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people were a little bit
confused, a little bit excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of confusion because I
haven't talked too much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep some things kind of secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things under wraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have some secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't talk about this plant a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did start talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about the plant I was
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with a male plant that is a BC
lemon skunk male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a BC lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC is the seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Vancouver, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a British Columbia lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the BC is not a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw on a message board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw on some forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a back cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is BC for back cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be what back cross is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this instance, it is a BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was back cross, it would have been
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have used a BX which drives
Pete crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy F1 Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somebody tags you in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have used BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC does work good for back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it would have been at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is BC lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stands for British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lemon skunk that came from
Vancouver, British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a monster male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it is not a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a BC seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: A BC lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A male.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one more detail I do want to throw out
there involving the same topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the same lemon skunk that is
used in the lemon Jeffrey or the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: sunrise or the jack tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a different lemon skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk that is used for the lemon
Jeffrey, the lemon sunrise or the firefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the jack tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually from greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a feminine seed that I've
been breeding to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another ramble we could talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about you can't breed to
fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you sure as shit can because I'm
reversing fem plants and breeding them to
[SPEAKER_00]: other fem plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting way off topic here,
but we're just rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the BC lemon skunk that I've been
talking about is a BC lemon skunk from BC
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other lemon skunk I've had for years
and I've talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a female from greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different plants, completely
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes any sense to everybody
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's segue into my next batch
of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording right at the start of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is June 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a good idea to take this
opportunity to remind you to calibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a pH meter, an EC meter,
whatever kind of meter you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with, maybe you're using a Dosatron,
go calibrate all of those devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a very good time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The start of the month is a beautiful time
to clean up and calibrate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got filters, go clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that needs to be
cleaned up, go clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the first of the month just to go
polish shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the start of the summer season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a head start on summer cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the grow room shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ahead of any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and find the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go calibrate all of your meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the air conditioner vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one of those portable air
conditioners, that thing has a filter in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got another kind of air
conditioner, could have a filter in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a heater, that sounds
crazy, but last night in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heater came on because it got super
fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a heater, maybe clean the
filter on the heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's got a filter that needs to be
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running some kind of hydro
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go clean all the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is a good day to clean all of your
grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, I'm going to focus on our pH
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I was at somebody's grow and
they were excited because they just
[SPEAKER_00]: bought, I recommended a Blue Lab pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Lab doesn't pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I shouldn't even have said the
brand, but I recommended a brand new Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab pH meter to my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went and got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed up at their grow together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hang out and work on their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy busted out a Blue Lab pH pen,
took it right out of the box, mixed up
[SPEAKER_00]: some nutrients and plopped it right into
the solution and read it and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, you didn't do that
correctly at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you got to calibrate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you've got to calibrate your
pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you now just because a
lot of people apparently do not know that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you buy your pH pen in the
instruction book, it is recommended that
[SPEAKER_00]: you soak that pH probe in a pH calibration
solution for 24 hours before calibrating
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just paid a hundred dollars for that
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not follow the instructions and set it
up correctly to work correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to rely on this device to
measure the nutrient solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we are feeding our entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nutrients, you paid a lot of money
for the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those nutrients to give you
maximum benefit on the crop that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you make sure the tools that
you just paid money for are not dialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: and calibrated fucking perfectly?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do if it were up to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get that new pH pen,
when it comes out of the box, the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you should do is set it in that
calibration solution for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may say 24 hours plus on your package,
on your instructions, read those,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may not recommend it,
but in the blue lab, it was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended in the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy didn't even bother to
calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm calling you out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to say your name,
but he's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he took it right out of the box
and plopped it in there and stirred it
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, the pH looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what the fuck are you
doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: But adjust it, calibrate that thing,
calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be, who knows how long it's
been sitting in the box?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows if it got calibrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what the guy at the factory
calibrated it at?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let it soak in the solution,
then take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are very simple steps for
calibrating a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, it's going to be a couple of
buttons until one thing flickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in the four solution until it
says four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to put it in the other
solution, clean it off between solutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull it out of the four, rinse it off in
clean water, then put it in the seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: then make sure it comes on at the seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's what I recommend, buy another
batch of four and or seven solution
[SPEAKER_00]: because just like I don't trust that
calibration, that original pen
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration, I don't trust these solutions
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they go dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a suspicious fucking person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got trust issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not trust these calibration solutions
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I buy another fresh bottle of four and
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pour a little bit of them into little
containers and then I re-dip my testing
[SPEAKER_00]: probe into that and make sure it shows me
four, clean it off, dip it into the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one, make sure it shows me seven on my
backup solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got four tests that are positive
that show me that it's actually calibrated
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would soak it in the solution for 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're going to go in the grow
the next day, pull it out, clean it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the four solution, calibrate it
properly, put it in the seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate it properly, clean it off
between each of those, then pour your
[SPEAKER_00]: other brand, your other bottle of
calibration solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your backup standard is what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your backups testing sample, then test
those again and make sure that they all
[SPEAKER_00]: come out properly four and seven as you
calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're double checking your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, we're paying a lot of
money for our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay a lot of money for the pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a lot of money, time,
space, energy, possibly felonies into our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things going into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we calibrate our pH pen and
get the pH the best that we can?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're just buying the thing and
using it, it might not be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep saying it,
calibrate the damn pH pen, do it today,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it while you're thinking about it,
do it while I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to take you a few minutes
if you've got the proper solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, we're spending all
this money on nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the plants to be able to uptake
those nutrients and without the proper pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff will just get left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be adding CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say those are two separate
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick with the bottle of
CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold in one bottle most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying this bottle of CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pH isn't right, you're putting the
CalMag into your feed solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pouring that into the plants and
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's falling out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even eating it because your pH
isn't correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adjust, correct that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plants, I'm not going to delve
too far into pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ramble more about calibrating
your equipment, but most plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to like a pH of somewhere between 5.8 and
6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get within that range,
most of your plants will be happy to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 6.3, 6.2 will be a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will depend on the age of your
plants, the size of your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the health of your plants,
the growth stage of your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: also the amount of food you're giving
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff will depend on,
will make, also the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, if you are,
you're in cocoa, are you in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make a big difference
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that pH dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, get your equipment
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go clean some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the fans, clean the air
conditioners, go clean your scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe buy some new scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been cutting a bunch of clones,
maybe today is the day to buy some new
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a sprayer to spray the
garden, clean the shit out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we can think about is
inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough nutrients to get
yourself through the crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough gloves to get yourself
through the crop, which you're working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared for harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you about to cut down some plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the first of the month is always
a good time to go take an inventory,
[SPEAKER_00]: order all of the shit that you need for
the rest of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have to stress about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, like on watering day,
when it comes time to feed, you're mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you got your pH probe in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I need some cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, ah, fuck them all out of cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to find out while you're in
the grow, mixing shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go shake the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go make a Google Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go make a spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go start making a list of things that you
use, and then mark how much is in each
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep track of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how often you got to buy it,
how often you got to order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this will help you keep track of how
much you were spending in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can determine how much you are
spending per pound or per ounce,
[SPEAKER_00]: every harvest in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've rambled on enough about
the first of the month adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I did notice in my
friends' grow, yeah, your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about this real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy's running three and five gallon
pots in his grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got cocoa amended with perlite in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look pretty good for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be, he knows what he needs to
do to make them look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to air his business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to call him out for one thing
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude is way over filling his pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys are putting, this is my
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys and gals can do whatever you want
in your grow, but my recommendation,
[SPEAKER_00]: this may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be just my buddy's brain fucking
really dinged when I gave him this advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fills the pots completely with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that a five gallon pot is
this tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, but we're going to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The five gallon pot is this tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude had cocoa to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost falling out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, why'd you put so much
cocoa in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, it's a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I put five gallons of cocoa
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's a really good thought
process, but how am I going to water this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm pouring in water and I
have to stand here and just fucking wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my watering container and I'm
pouring in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need somewhere between
probably like a half to maybe two thirds
[SPEAKER_00]: of that gallon of water that I've got,
but instead of just being able to pour it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, it's like running off the top of
the pot because he's got it so full in
[SPEAKER_00]: that cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hydrophobic, but it's packed in
there pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I can't absorb it as quickly as
I want to pour it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my dude would have left, I don't know,
maybe an inch, maybe two inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an inch and a half of space at the
top of that pot, maybe just a half an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch, I'd be able to just pour that water
in and it would spread across the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: then puddle down in there evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead I'm over there just fucking
trickling water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you, just leave a little
bit of space so that that way we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: some water in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just pour that water right on there,
keep moving, keep going, keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've rambled on enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to answer some
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from my friend,
Wicked Nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Wicked Nugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on and it does say,
I was just listening to episode 651,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're way behind brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're caught up in going back,
but thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and I had a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does a breeder find a gem bag seed and
create a new strain from it, not knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: the lineage of that genetic strain and
start breeding from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I love the show and I listened to
it during the grow, during the busy work
[SPEAKER_00]: life in the AirPods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like I just gained so much
knowledge and helps pass time and I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned and take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing the show, I'm usually
thinking that people are either watching
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube or they're working with me in
their AirPods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up for letting me know that I'm
getting you through a work day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I used to do when I was at the
commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put on the AirPods and there was
something good in the ears and just jam
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would keep, when people see two
AirPods in, they know that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that always made life easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on, learning a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that you're learning and
taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the goal is here, is to teach
people, get everybody growing the best
[SPEAKER_00]: herb they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, thanks for all you do Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerely, Wicked Nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, how does a breeder find a
gem bag seed and breed from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: not knowing the lineage of that strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a couple of different thought
processes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, if it's a good strain,
if it's a good plant, you can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter at all what the history,
genetics, lineage, story behind it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a grower grows a plant, we just go,
oh shit, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you know that's not the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you hope it's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you really, really know that
that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a random plant that nobody
knows really the story of it, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just, if it came from a bag, you know at
least one half of it, it came from this
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called this, you know, half of it
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's too easy to know all the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, so let's talk about a
very famous cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a very famous,
very, very famous strain that happened a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend after you listen to this
podcast, I recommend checking out the
[SPEAKER_00]: legend of chem dog and the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cannabis enthusiast,
a strain hunter, a phenohunter,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is something I recommend you check
out because that will correlate very well
[SPEAKER_00]: with what I'm about to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chem dog, all of the chem dog line was
bag seed to be, if you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude, chem bought some weed and in
that weed were seeds and he grew them and
[SPEAKER_00]: he found 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of those 13 seeds, some were boys,
some were females, some he still has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those famous plants that came from
that were the original chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem 91, the chem D, the chem sister,
all of those came from that bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are all breeding, all of the
breeders I know, everybody that's bred
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff is breeding to one of those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breeding with one of those because
that shit is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we know about it,
since it got so popular and since cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture has blossomed and developed,
we know a lot more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the exact genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that a guy named, I know his real
name, I almost said it, sorry bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy named chem got some weed from some
guys in Colorado and those guys called the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it the chem weed because it
smelled like chemicals and when he smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it would make you roll over like a
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one guy called it dog weed,
the other guy called it chem weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys met up at a Grateful Dead
concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They traded some of it later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog got home and he called them and
he's like, can you send me more?
[SPEAKER_00]: They mailed more of it from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem found seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically, that's the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other guys don't know the origin,
genetics, lineage or history of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, allegedly, possibly, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, when chem dog got it and
started breeding with it, it was just bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, but he knew the weed it came from
was fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all he had to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he grew the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants were grown, some of them
were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we all know chem dog,
chem D, chem 91, chem sister, we've all
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us have smoked all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an area where cannabis has
any sort of legalization, you've probably
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked those or something that somebody
grew and tried to tell you was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're really prolific and dominant
strains in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've all, and a lot of the breeders
have gotten their hands on them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see a plant like that and you
grow it and you smoke it, you know that is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you want to breed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, pick my King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw that, I was like, that's the
dude right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the guy to breed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I saw strawberry starburst,
I was like, that needs some pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a breeder intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how do you breed to it
without knowing the genetics or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool to know the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of cool details, but you don't
need to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were breeding plants and crossing
cannabis plants long before we knew all
[SPEAKER_00]: this fancy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the new generation, I'm a little bit
older than a lot of the youngsters out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but I am also part of the internet
generation where I'm freaking spoiled,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I could go on the internet and type
in, I want to find these cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and 45 websites will come up and I can
order them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I've got some, I got a couple of
friends in the seed industry so I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get, but basically whatever seeds I'm
searching for, but we're spoiled now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you had to get whatever
seeds you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some bag seeds, you had to
accept those and grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some clones, you just had to
hope they were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoever selected those clones did a
good job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're freaking spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer is just do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look amazing, if they have
the traits you want, it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about knowing what traits you're
looking for, knowing the goal,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a goal, understanding the plant,
understanding pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What plants are you going to put that to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this plant offer in a mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to compliment the other
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, growing them out and
testing the offspring is another big part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by not knowing the lineage and
genetics, how do you start breeding from
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw some pollen on it, bro, and see what
it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the funnest things about
breeding and growing weed, just seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: what the outcome is after you do some
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, thank you for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Wicked Nugs for
the good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
concerns, or follow ups, I'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you've got the email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into one more email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from my friend Buzzards
Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Buzzards Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'm coming up in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it's Buzzards Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see your success on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost to 750 episodes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, come a long way since a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing 4K video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's multi-cam when both cams
wanna cooperate, when I feel like fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: with both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just wanna smash camera two
right onto the floor, but we're gonna keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the vibes positive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, I had a quick question
about mail selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can answer this question really
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make regular seeds and you find a
mail you really like, do you have clones
[SPEAKER_00]: of that mail as a backup or is that mail
used once and then you find a new mail to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when you discuss King
Solomon, do you have a backup clone of
[SPEAKER_00]: him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay ire, my bro, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for burping in the middle of
your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace from Buzzards Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buzzards Bay, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of you may not know, a lot of you
may know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the head breeder, the sole
proprietor of ire Genetics Premium Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know, you may have heard about my
mail plant known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in a Rise F1 mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've named him King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you research King Solomon, you'll get
the joke behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But King Solomon makes a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Buzzards Bay is asking,
do I keep a mother plant or a father
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, if you will, of King Solomon or do
I find a new one every time or do I have
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of backups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is honestly how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep a plant of King Solomon all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one main mother plant that I
keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a father plant, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stays in a five gallon pot right under the
middle of all the lights in the bedroom or
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where he chills.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is King Solomon's spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll get big, he'll get bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as he's big enough to start giving
me a few clones, because I re-clone him
[SPEAKER_00]: every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start growing him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a fresh clone of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say I just cut brand new
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a brand new clone of King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put him into a pot, grow him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as he's big enough to give me a
cut, I take another cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that one in a smaller pot and
they just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always got one or two of King
Solomon around just to keep that one
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because that's my gem, I've always
got him around.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one or two other copies of him as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I need clones for breeding from
him, I generally take them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go grab a few off the biggest
one, because that one's getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna have to get cut down or do
something with it eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go get as many clones as I need and
then I'll grow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw those into the flower room so I can
make my pollen happen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when that one gets too big,
cut him down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the next plant keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I keep one big father plant for
approximately three to six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how big he gets and how many
cuts I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a male, so I generally only need two
clones of him at any time, plus a backup,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I keep one big plant and I cut clones
off that as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about every once or twice a year,
I cut him down and start him over and give
[SPEAKER_00]: him a fresh cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut a bunch of clones and keep the best
two as the brand new starters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to try to start again from
seed every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that King Solomon's
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding a male is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding that male, I have to grow out
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to eliminate the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to find the dudes that have the
traits I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got to audition those and narrow
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've chosen what I like, then I have
to pollinate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have to grow that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big process, choosing a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely try to keep the same dude
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's the BC Lemon Skunk
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all kept around in big pots in
different areas, different locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the pollen never gets crossed
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know there's never,
I call it the Maury Povich situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always know who the baby daddy is,
and I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy Buzzard, thank you for
the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I've got for you guys for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening to
