[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 192 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band until I can use their music on
my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Mike is on the
podcast, but as we were doing the intro
[SPEAKER_00]: music, he took a little tiny micro dab and
he gave me the kill the mic sign and his
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone's turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the fuck he went.
[SPEAKER_00]: He rambled off somewhere into my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's wandering around somewhere,
bathroom, living room area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he has emerged through the clouds of
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's several shades of pink and purple,
but he will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is on the podcast with us
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody laugh at white Mike for taking
too big of a dab and changing colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just headed to the men's room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out what happened to Mike in a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he doesn't make it back by the time the
song's over, we might go look for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike joined me for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a normal Monday episode by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropped a Wednesday episode with Mike on
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Thursday, I did the old, the
revisited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, bro, you're still coughing and
turning colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to quit smoking those cigarettes,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cigarettes are the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slavery in a box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a dab break coming up here in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Mike's going to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to have to not take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, be careful, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back with your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taking Davey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude, it's going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little man's first trip out of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: First trip anywhere other than the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, it's going to be a fun time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck on that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck on that sober break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some tequila in the
hotel.
[SPEAKER_03]: International travel with a two year old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get all of my family for the first time
in like 15 years and I get sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a big, weird smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your birthday, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a fun, next couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get back, come hang out with
Rasta Jeff and we won't record.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just get you so high that you don't
stop coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: After my last little break, one little hit
on the bowl that I had left on my desk
[SPEAKER_03]: when we left for the trip was all it took
to green me out for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are way off topic, but I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much at this point in time,
how much do you normally consume?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to ask a follow up question,
but I'm going to ask it before I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that based on your budget or does that
satisfy your need?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lucky I found a way to do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stockpile when I'm able.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: For long time listeners or regular
listeners are familiar with my vintage
[SPEAKER_03]: hash collection now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mike's kind of a hash hoarder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stock up and now I've got hash that's
like a year and a half old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful, gets me crazy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the stuff that breaks down as
it ages is really effective medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids changes, they break down
as it gets older.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little less stony, but a little
more medically active.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know, daily consumption or...
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you smoke on a normal day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I'm hurting from something
specific, like I did something and really
[SPEAKER_03]: hurt my back or something to just manage
my normal pain, usually around a gram of
[SPEAKER_03]: flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a day with anywhere between like one
and five or seven dabs thrown in
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, tiny little me dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little tiny micro mic dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm doing nothing all day, like if it's
just a me day and I can kind of go with
[SPEAKER_03]: the flow and I'm not trying to do nothing
all day and just medicate, because I can
[SPEAKER_03]: go through a lot more than that in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one gram of flour and seven dabs
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like seven dabs would be like,
I was dabbing a lot that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably... Today, the one I'm coughing
on is my third dab of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you took two of those here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got through and it's almost nine o
'clock at night, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I took another one today
is because a friend came by the house real
[SPEAKER_03]: quick and was like, want to dab real
quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to whoever dabbed out,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's typically mostly flour
until I mean nine or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the kid goes to bed and things get
calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid gets to bed and then I get like
the stuff around the house done that like
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do while I'm also caring for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's usually some scramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dishes, laundry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that requires more than three
fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds weird, but I know what you
mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like 5% of your thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you got to pay too much attention
to.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that can't handle itself,
you got to wait till he goes down to take
[SPEAKER_03]: care of for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as I get that stuff wrapped
up, like I can chill and dab and relax and
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoy my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're smoking a gram of flour and
probably on average sounds closer to five
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your dabs, a gram could last you two
weeks at the rate you dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the other trick with trying
to convert the number of dabs I take in a
[SPEAKER_03]: given time period to a weight is I've got
like 50 or 60 different grams that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: actively dabbing from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one dab from here, one dab from
there, one dab from over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never taken the time to weigh out one
of my dabs at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 0.09, like not even 0.1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.05 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I usually go pretty small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my lungs don't like the big hot ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, some listeners are going,
wait, did he just say he had 50 grams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's got 50 containers that have all
been being smoked from through the past
[SPEAKER_00]: six months through a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most of them have like a quarter
gram or a half gram left in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the size dabs you take,
I mean, that's plenty of dabs left in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had to buy, I mean, I can't even
remember the last time I bought Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I haven't had extra money to
spend on Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been saving up for a handful of
different things, including this trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like I've got Hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to spend money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been actively trying to get rid of
the different containers that I've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if one starts getting much lower than
the others, I'll focus on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to get it out of the pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you need help, bro,
I know a guy that takes dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was struck that I meant to bring two or
three of the different containers over
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight and I left them all sitting on my
desk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sidetracked sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I've actively been going
through it and I've still got 40 or 50
[SPEAKER_03]: containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably got 10 or 12 different
flavors on deck right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably got more Hash on the table
than I've got at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have way more containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about seven to 10 grams of one
kind right here and similar on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got six stacks of this
Apothecary Lemon Jeffrey right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more in the bag over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some Citrus Sap Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some Water Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in here, this is a fun little
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: This container, I grab some Shatter and
put Shatter in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it gets low, I just grab
Shatter from another container,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my little to-go container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I dab on when I'm out and
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I stop at someone's house or if I have
a little break, this is what I dab out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, holy shit,
I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, it's just a mix of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been good for the last six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sits in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all just melts into one little
puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all congealed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's my little time bomb right there
of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was getting to, before we got
sidetracked on Mike having 50 containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was getting to is he smokes a gram
of flour in maybe a half a gram of Shatter
[SPEAKER_00]: over a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one gram of flour a day and a half a
gram of Shatter over a week, probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you put it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to go to Mexico for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you come back, you think it's
going to take one dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one dab just to make you have to lay
on the couch, feet go numb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be giggle high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't greened out in two years since
the last time I took a tea break.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it on vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my experience, the only thing you need
to go to in your life to go from daily
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana consumption to no marijuana
consumption for a few days is some
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting shit in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a break in the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I went to the warm up half of
Mardi Gras, the couple of weeks before
[SPEAKER_03]: actual Mardi Gras with the topless and the
drunkenness is just like family fun
[SPEAKER_03]: drunkenness where it's exactly the same,
but everybody keeps their top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, almost everybody keeps their top on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that got the memo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always one or two people that
clearly showed up in town this morning who
[SPEAKER_03]: are already way too hammered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them keeps trying to take their
shirt off while everyone in their group is
[SPEAKER_03]: like, no, it's two weeks from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just checking out New Orleans was more
than enough to take my mind off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you did get some weed and it was
super impressive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I kept running into people that were
offering to sell me weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made me laugh because more than one
of them was like, dude, my guy gets it
[SPEAKER_03]: from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them I'd been chatting with for
like 10 minutes while we sat there and
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gets me on the phone with his guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's how far he takes this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He pulls out his cell phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, let me call my bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll really appreciate the referral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you seem like you really
prefer to be stoned right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he calls the guy and he puts,
he hands me the phone and he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, he just said you're from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, yeah, I'm really from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy on the phone goes,
my weed's not from Colorado and just hangs
[SPEAKER_03]: up the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't even bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, this guy is going to call me
out as soon as we try to take his money.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I've done this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've hopped on my bike because that's how
everybody that was selling weed that I ran
[SPEAKER_03]: into did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down there was just bike messenger
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not riding my bike 15 blocks,
you know, a week before Mardi Gras when
[SPEAKER_03]: everything's nuts and crowded to show up
when the guy's going to take one look at
[SPEAKER_03]: it and be like, get this fucking mids out
of my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your New Orleans swamp weed away from
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want none of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of times I ran into people
smoking weed out in public.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife's not a cannabis aficionado like I
am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't partake at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it has it for like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can smell me when I show up from a
mile away.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, God, you reek.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming over the bridge now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we're in New Orleans,
she kept leaning over and going,
[SPEAKER_03]: even I know that smells bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like nine or 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it wasn't that the trip where she
got pregnant.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the trip where we found out we
were pregnant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminiscent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's going to be a short break,
but my consumption has been lighter this
[SPEAKER_03]: round too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a tea break every now and again,
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use what you were talking
about into a segue, but I want to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: this dab of Lemon Jeffery before I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just hoping you turn at least some
colors because that dab was massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I got a good hit just with the extra
vapor in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a soldier, so it won't be as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look, the hair on my arm did move and
Mike went to pull the extra leftover smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's so tasty that you'll get a
good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is usually like a Mike dab left in
the rig when he's done with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make me choke like mad because
it's the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the hot dab on my smoker lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You melt that smoker tar back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of set up something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email from somebody today and you
kind of went the right direction to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it a segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm opening up the email on my phone
because my iPhone locks because I have it
[SPEAKER_00]: on this low battery mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just locks every seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this person asked, they said,
I started listening to your podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting through some of the episodes
and loving the info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started growing and I'm on my second
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That a boy or girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, because he can sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could be girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continues to say my wife is a T1 diabetic
and started getting gastroparesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has trouble with appetite and indica's
make her hungry, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also starting to get anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know weed is great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct weed is good for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weed will give people a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite weed will give most people a
panic attack.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in luck though, because for most
folks, what stimulates hunger is also good
[SPEAKER_03]: for the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to have to hunt real
far from what you're already shopping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar strains will have that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the email goes on to say,
sorry, I'm coughing after that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, can you help me
figure out medical type dosing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to get high, but what does
medical treatment look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small amounts each hour, every two hours,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends the email with, we're in Oregon,
so strains here can be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing characteristics to look for in
strains would be very helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say your name on the air
because I don't know if you want me to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did verify that by the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that name could be a girl's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be careful with all this new shit
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said it in the email,
but where's he located?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then looking for what does medical
dosing look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does medical dosing look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which explains why you asked me that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why do you want to know my
consumption rates on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: You started talking about taking a
consumption break and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this will be a smooth segue if my
high ass can make it work.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, medical consumption is just,
everybody's got to find that fine line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is what you're looking for is,
that space between I've consumed a dose
[SPEAKER_03]: low enough that it's not intoxicating or
it's not reducing the number of things I
[SPEAKER_03]: feel comfortable doing or participating in
in my daily life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also a large enough dose that
it's treating whatever medical condition
[SPEAKER_03]: you're seeking to treat with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a threshold, a short time
period where you are too high you are more
[SPEAKER_00]: high than you'd prefer to be to get the
medicine to work medically for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over a small period of time,
the high will wear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll adjust to the high and the medicine
part will still be valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always encourage people to start very,
very low and slowly work up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, unless you're talking
about you've got a cancer diagnosis or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, if you're looking to
stimulate appetite or ease some anxiety or
[SPEAKER_03]: help you sleep, start off really low,
start off with five milligrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: two and a half milligrams, seven
milligrams, something light and see how
[SPEAKER_03]: that affects you and slowly build up from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to a couple of people that were
like, I started with a hundred milligrams
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's just too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, duh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just told me you started off with a
whole bottle of whiskey and didn't like
[SPEAKER_03]: what it did to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because you didn't do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where to draw the line
between medical dosing and getting high
[SPEAKER_00]: because like I said earlier, you may have
to smoke until you feel a little head buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: before the pain goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe that's part of the medicine
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that being high is actually part of
what helps with the medication because you
[SPEAKER_00]: forget that you've got this condition that
makes you anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that mental thing is actually
part of the medical treatment for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is a very individual topic
because this is going to be very different
[SPEAKER_03]: for each person because I know lots of
people that need some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: intoxicating symptoms to start kicking in
before the anxiety starts to dissipate,
[SPEAKER_03]: before the hunger starts to kick in,
before the muscle spasticity starts to
[SPEAKER_03]: slow down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just kind of have to chill
for a minute and wait for a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: that intoxication to pass before they go
about whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that listen to the show,
they've been through it with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, if they've listened for the past
two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The injury didn't happen on the show,
but like this events took place while you
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never missed an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a couple of episodes where
I wasn't even fucking there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember sitting at this table
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember it, but it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember listening to those episodes
going, wow, I said some dumb shit on those
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes I have, I have leftover
effects from that traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bother me all day sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just things that you,
if you have a brain injury, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have to get high to make that
go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that works other than me
just being high enough to where I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that that's bothering me because
I have to get distracted from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so bothersome that I can't get,
I can't get away.
[SPEAKER_03]: People find the cannabis's ability to help
you forget extremely beneficial for a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: PTSD, nightmares is a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically folks, if you're not
familiar with this particular aspect of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, your body has a system in place
for helping you forget stuff you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you think about your last commute
to work, like how many blue Chevy's did
[SPEAKER_03]: you pass?
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody knows the answer to that
question, like please go see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're Rain Man and then you're
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but your mind isn't supposed to
remember that kind of information because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not helpful or useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for most people who aren't Rain Man,
having that sort of idyllic memory recall
[SPEAKER_03]: is just troublesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to remember the important events
that happened in your day is, is
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculously difficult if you remember
every minute detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so basic memory, you just remember the
important shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis helps that system work a bit
more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also heard people describe it as
there's a number of things your brain
[SPEAKER_03]: takes care of all day, like your breathing
and your blinking and your sweating that
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't have conscious effort or
conscious awareness of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like your heartbeat, for example,
is one a lot of first time consumers get.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get really baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hear their heart beat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think they're going to have a heart
attack and they get all worked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always hear your heartbeat,
but your body always hears it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it tunes it out until you get baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it forgets that it's got that
loop on autopilot and people freak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to the hospital, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a heart attack, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freaking out, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine, a family member,
we just hit the two year anniversary of
[SPEAKER_03]: them showing up to my house the first time
they dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they were a very light consumer
and they took a huge dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in their words, like as their face was
getting warm and tingly, um, they asked
[SPEAKER_03]: what was in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody said acid and just not
knowing any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They freaked out and somebody had to give
them a ride home and they were halfway
[SPEAKER_03]: home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, don't take me home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take me to Mike's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he'll know what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, have popsicle and let's
chat for 20 minutes again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, unwind you a little bit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caffeine, some coffee and a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that blood sugar back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go slow folks, especially when you're
just starting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of people come into
cannabis looking for medical treatments
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're not looking to get baked at a
concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the introduction to the world is
very different than it was for a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they, this, uh, they seem like they
have been smoking because she,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they say she has trouble with
appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica's make her hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know the difference between indica
and sativa and they know that she can
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke to get hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they also say that she's starting to
get anxiety that they know weed is good
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they seem like they know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their main question it feels like was what
does medical treatment look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small amounts each hour, every two hours,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that honestly is one of my favorite
parts of about medical cannabis is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: get to decide what works best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give, when you go to the
doctor, even if the doctor gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription for whatever pill you take,
I don't take any pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't, uh, whatever pill they give
you, they put a number on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many you take every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that fucks you up, makes you
goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that doesn't take the pain away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, oh, well, you get 30 pills are
going to last you a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you have to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can take a puff this big and it
takes your pain away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to take 17 dabs to get to
the position you need to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part about cannabis is that I
can grow my own or I can go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like these folks are growing
their own, but my favorite part is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can control my own consumption for the
needs that I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on some days I don't need it as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: On some days I need it a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's cold, my body hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I worked for 12 hours a day in the
garden, my knees feel blown out and I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to take extra dabs at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is my favorite part is being able
to decide my medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my guidance on that part is what works
best for you is what's got to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking, smoke light,
and then play a little game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a Saturday and maybe pass your
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you know you're perfectly medicated,
smoke a little extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it medicates you better,
or if you get too high and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable, it's only going to last a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to find that window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to experiment with that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each train is going to treat you a
little differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for some adjustments and
some different stuff, some new things if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you first started,
every time you bring a different strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you're shopping in a rec
store or retail store, or even on the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market, when you first get that
fresh bag of pot home, especially when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a new consumer, go easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potency can vary widely, even when it
basically looks the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just go easy and you should be able to
find that window.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to work well for you without
too much hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're eating edibles, do five
milligrams, then do 10, then the next day,
[SPEAKER_00]: do 20 and find your zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if 25 is too much, do 20 from now on
until it quits working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to have to increase
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the head buzz starts wearing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll be able to increase the
dosage without getting so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part of the question says we're
in Oregon, so strains here can be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing characteristics to look for in
strains would be very helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not exactly sure what you mean by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Characteristics to look for in strains,
um, Indica stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's probably best things
with high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have lab testing available,
uh, maybe LA confidential, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jilly bean is a sativa dominant strain,
but it's really mellow and puts a smile on
[SPEAKER_00]: my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it didn't seem to make me
overwhelmingly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin and I were talking, uh, hung out
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kev bro from, uh, elevated concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on some of the older episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was over the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were taking some dads and we were
talking about old strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deadhead OG used to make us have to take a
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this, uh, deadhead OG clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, that every time somebody would
smoke it, they'd be like, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd be like, why you got a shit and
be like, yeah, how could you tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause that weed makes everyone have
to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some phenotypes of deadhead OG
that'll maybe good for your
[SPEAKER_00]: gastrointestinal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause every time I smoked it, I had to
poo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's on the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find that one, it's all going
to be about what's available in your area
[SPEAKER_00]: and what works, uh, specifically for your
wife's, uh, physical makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause cannabis is going to react
differently to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that question was about selecting
strains for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's about selecting strains to grow an
organ, uh, I don't know if you're indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: or outdoors and I'm really not sure what
to recommend for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to email me back and clarify
that, you know, I'll answer it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry that our best advice is just
experiment slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but unfortunately that's where we're
stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point we're at right now with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a really good question,
but the thing about it is you just gotta,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, how do I know how hard of a
punch I can take?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had this conversation a lot when I was
working a sales counter, I ran into a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people who, I mean, their story was
basically my doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, and I kind of ran out of options and
somebody in my medical team was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: why don't you go try this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I drove over here to help.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, that, that was my job was
taking those people in, in kind of showing
[SPEAKER_03]: them the whole whole, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what sucks about the new,
a lot of the newer, I say new,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the new system, when Mike and I were
in this, you could come to our dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you weren't sure what strain you
wanted, we let you smoke both of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can decide what strain you wanted
to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do miss the vaporizer under the counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had pre-rolled joints of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my favorite pipe on the counter when
we were running Metamar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bong up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used, I used, before we got super busy,
I was having a lot of fun smoking with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come just to buy an eighth and
smoke it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much fun, but we could be able
to smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when you go to a medical shop,
it's buy and leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much shut up by leave is how
it feels in these medical facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could consume, if we had a little
room in the back where a trained
[SPEAKER_00]: professional like Mike or myself,
or there's a lot of others that could help
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could hang out and we could have
somebody that could help children and they
[SPEAKER_00]: could help tell them like, oh,
you've got this condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen these results from this
product, or this is the best way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you and I can be like, oh, you never
smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fucking peanut butter and jelly
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an Xbox or a whatever you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a place to plug in your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a comfy safe spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your first rip off of this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop, stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sometimes some people don't know and
they'll just get that pipe and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, that was your first hit of weed
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to call your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to tell them, just take a
little puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time, that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time, do two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third time, do three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where your threshold is.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a lot of people walking into this now,
smoking is not your only option.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Oregon's not far behind Colorado
with this, but we have pills now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just go to the store and get a
five milligram THC pill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you know exactly what milligram
you're taking, how often you're taking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still stuck experimenting and
figuring out how many milligrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: how often work better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little easier to dose that way
instead of like, well, I take two hits of
[SPEAKER_03]: the sour diesel and I take one and a half
hits of the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you're into it for a little
while, you'll find your rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes your little ritual and it's
part of your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of being able to control
your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got my little dad set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got their stuff differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You carry your products differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got their little pipe carrier
and the little setup at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll become part of your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not start your cannabis career
with dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make your introduction to cannabis a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll piss you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be way too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like starting off your relationship
with booze with moonshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the dispensary, hit up your cool
nephew, whatever you got to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you are, you know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some decent weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're not even going to make
people paranoid about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some quality weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch some ESPN, watch some Golden Girls,
whatever you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it treats you all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then smoke a little more next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then smoke one of these days,
just smoke until you hit that threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our emailer also said that they were on
their second garden now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you send me some questions
about that garden so that we can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: improve that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that we taught your wife a little
bit about dosing and I hope that things
[SPEAKER_00]: get better for the whole family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ditto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ditto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the last, we've done so many
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was two episodes ago,
three episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about some rules that were
coming down the pipe in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those have been changed and
adjusted.
[SPEAKER_03]: SB 1220 took another step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean it's getting closer to
actually happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change a lot of things for a
lot of people in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not going to do anything they
think it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's only going to make it harder for
medical patients to get access to safe
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis like they need.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave you a good rundown last time,
but just for anybody who's not familiar,
[SPEAKER_03]: SB 1220 is this year's version of
Colorado's caregiver crackdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado right now, the press keeps saying
the rule is 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've wanted to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to read an article,
but with the both of us here, we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even need to read an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with what the rules were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, that's kind of where I was
going with this right now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you can grow as six plants as
just any adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a recreation, private residence,
six plants in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's you and a spouse or you and
another adult over 21, 12 plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just double it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Colorado, all of these numbers you
cut in half and you can have half in
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and half not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there a limit to how many people
live in my house?
[SPEAKER_03]: That depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of places like Denver, several
municipalities now have passed their own
[SPEAKER_03]: little local rules saying you can only
have 12, you can only have 16,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can only have 18 per residence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which already sets up this kind of
confusing loophole where you and your
[SPEAKER_03]: roommates have a meeting where you decide
who gets to exercise their constitutional
[SPEAKER_03]: rights and who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and because these are new laws,
like these are just bizarre events that
[SPEAKER_03]: take place in Colorado now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and those are just the recreational
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now medical, which is what SB 12 20 is
targeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it applies to rec as well,
but it just enforces that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the plant cap statewide instead of
letting it be local, um, medically in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado, you can grow as, uh,
your standard medical marijuana account is
[SPEAKER_03]: six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but depending on what your doctor
thinks is medically appropriate,
[SPEAKER_03]: your card, uh, might say 20 plants or 50
plants or 150 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the media is getting
confused and saying the limit was 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some doctors would recommend 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of pushing the limits doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was only if that doctor felt like it
was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never anything spoken of about
it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was kind of a gray area there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The medical rules in Colorado have been
around since the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going on 17 years that these
rules have been in play now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they've never been officially
amended.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've just been amended in practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the 99 plant count comes
from is, uh, the federal government uses
[SPEAKER_03]: 99 plants is their cutoff limit for you're
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have 99 plants, you are not
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a hundred plants, holy shit,
wow, look at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal government is very interested
in what you're doing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so in practice in Colorado,
the cutoff limit for the biggest medical,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, marijuana plant count cards sort of
became 99 over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember 500 count cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I remember when an acquaintance of
ours had six, 500 plant counts assigned to
[SPEAKER_03]: his, um, his name as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they couldn't grow anywhere near that
amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they just didn't have the time,
the space, the energy of the money,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they, they racked up that plant count.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and basically every year the rules in
practice for this get a little tighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as the state takes a swing at
attempting to officially change the rules
[SPEAKER_03]: in this year, it looks like they're
official rule change might actually make
[SPEAKER_03]: it through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this week they decided to tweak the
rules that are being proposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, everybody, uh, with a medical
marijuana card or any caregiver could grow
[SPEAKER_03]: up to 12 plants per residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plants per residence is their proposed
cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the, that's the automatic default
limit is 12 plants per residence in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if you're a medical marijuana
patient who's medical marijuana card,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, says they need more plants than 12,
or if you've got multiple people living in
[SPEAKER_03]: a single home, or if you're a caregiver
with more plants and patients assigned to
[SPEAKER_03]: you to add up to more than 12,
you can go to the state and local
[SPEAKER_03]: government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you're in the city of Pueblo,
you would go to the city of Pueblo and the
[SPEAKER_03]: state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if it's asked for
permission or just let them know and sign
[SPEAKER_03]: up and then you could do 24 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 12 with just a, um, medical marijuana
recreate a recommendation or with an
[SPEAKER_00]: option on an extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have to go register for 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have to have the
extended plan count to go with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would still need all your paperwork to
cover your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably have to take that with you when
you go to register.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm sure that if these rules pass when
they pass, there will be an official
[SPEAKER_03]: process to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the really interesting stuff with what
happened with this bill this week is the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that isn't really in the press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for stuff like this, when it gets a
hearing in front of the house or the
[SPEAKER_03]: Senate or in this, uh, this case,
I think it was a Senate, uh, subcommittee
[SPEAKER_03]: that, uh, voted on it this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be a public announcement that
they're holding the hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for stuff like this, it ends up
with like hours and hours and hours of
[SPEAKER_03]: redundant tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what was on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you can't trust that to turn that
into RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't know where the product came
from, I have no comfort turning it into an
[SPEAKER_00]: oil to use as a cancer fighting agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you just think of, so you're a
medical marijuana patient, you can buy two
[SPEAKER_03]: ounces at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you go to a med shop, um, and buy two
ounces, go home, come back the next day,
[SPEAKER_03]: buy two ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do that eight times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got your pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like already it's taking you eight days
just to inquire your base ingredients for
[SPEAKER_03]: your meds for this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when your caregiver will show up with
it already processed for you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring it right to you or you go pick
it up from them, depending on how you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got it arranged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on if you're homebound or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, these, these have serious
implications for, for people, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: people's lives and livelihood and health
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so a lot of people tend to show up
to these hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this week, this week's hearing came out
of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then when it started, it was clear
that, um, the crowd that's typically there
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't there because the hearing came out
of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one was expecting it to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then the bill had several
amendments that no one had heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one knew what it was, the bill was
going to do until after it was voted on,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, or after public testimony was over,
then the amendments get discussed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, the first time 1220 went up
for hearing testimony was nine,
[SPEAKER_03]: public testimony was nine hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this week when it went up for hearing,
it was like an hour and 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that missing seven hours and
change is the people who didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: enough time and notice to get to the
hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then come the end of public
testimony, we hear these amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's where the plant camp,
plant, uh, plant cap changed from 16
[SPEAKER_03]: statewide as a default back down to 12
with, uh, you can register with the state
[SPEAKER_03]: and county.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found a way to charge us some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to charge you a small fee
for that 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like, um, a couple of
groups got together with the governor's
[SPEAKER_03]: office over the weekend and came up,
like hammered out some compromise
[SPEAKER_03]: amendments to make, um, a couple of
different, um, organizations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: typically on our side of this
conversation, um, finally turn around and
[SPEAKER_03]: support the bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I heard a number of different groups
that had words like patient caregiver in
[SPEAKER_03]: the name of their little organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or, um, maybe worked out to an acronym
that might be familiar with that or
[SPEAKER_03]: Russian pilots staying close enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was shocked at the number of support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orders that had flipped from last week to
this week with saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: with these amendments, we can support this
bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, last week we were dead set against it
this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're okay with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no one really knows what all happened
behind those closed doors to get all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these groups on board, but it seems shady
shit to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Kirsten why is money right away?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she's an eight, uh, associated press
reporter, follow her Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you want an easy way to find it,
go to my Twitter and look for retweets,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, she is all over the Colorado
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she writes for the cannabis
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they use a lot of her stuff,
but, uh, she works for the associated
[SPEAKER_03]: press and then the cannabis syndicates her
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she knows the cannabis beat for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: She does some great reporting and her
Colorado legislature reporting on this has
[SPEAKER_03]: been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, her Twitter feeds been the highlight
of my week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, two weeks in a row now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this happens, uh, all it's going to
really do in my opinion is make medical
[SPEAKER_00]: users have to go to dispensaries and pay
dispensary taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I mean, that's the real goal
behind the bill is to get rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, during public testimony, the people
who are supporting it, the people who put
[SPEAKER_03]: this forward, um, they're saying it's
going to get rid of home grows cartels
[SPEAKER_03]: home grows being robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same way that saying making
guns illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get rid of guns.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is even dumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause the, I mean, most gun owners are
law abiding citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make guns illegal, bad guys are
still going to have guns because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: bad guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that they're targeting in this
bill are the people that are growing large
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts of marijuana and sending it out of
state caregivers aren't doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've got patients that would,
you would murder me if I grew cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it went anywhere but to your lungs,
there's not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with the rules as they already are,
I smoke so much of what I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get my leftovers basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, repeatedly during the testimony people
brought up, um, the caregiver registry was
[SPEAKER_03]: only became mandatory January 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the new doctor, um, rules and regs
came down the pipe in October.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those are just now taking effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the extended plant count stuff that
we've already covered here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter how many plants I'm
totally legally allowed to grow in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, unless your doctor is willing to risk
their medical license and go to court to
[SPEAKER_03]: testify that you need more than six plants
to treat your condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ain't getting more than six.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the people who have, uh,
are allegedly being targeted by this bill,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, are the people who are scamming the
medical marijuana doctors to get extended
[SPEAKER_03]: plant counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, it's a scam because those
patients don't need anywhere near that
[SPEAKER_03]: level of medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that there's a plenty of excess to send
to Arkansas or wherever they're shipping
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and these, they, they're not following
federal trafficking rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not following state medical rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not following building code rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they aren't interested in anything
other than profit and they think they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get rid of them with a plant cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've been trying to get rid of
illegal home grows our entire adult lives,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first time I remember a girl in
my neighborhood getting busted,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like seven or eight and it was a
dude I knew cause he was friends with
[SPEAKER_03]: someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad went hunting with occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in California when I was a little
tiny kid and everybody grew weed where I
[SPEAKER_00]: lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in kind of on the coast and then
kind of the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody grew weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what all the white people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all grew weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The marijuana market in the U S was
shifting from an important market to a
[SPEAKER_03]: domestic production market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So growing weed in your home has only
become more popular as we've gotten older.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in Colorado, we've got a couple of
great sets of laws where our medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana system lets people treat their
ailments with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They let their doctor determine how much
cannabis is necessary, what, how many
[SPEAKER_03]: plants are necessary to produce that
medicine regimen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they allow you to assign a
caregiver so that I don't have to spend
[SPEAKER_03]: most of my day perfecting growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my microphone needs Viagra.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just went lip on them all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pointed straight at the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Nope, I give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do without, without you as my caregiver,
I couldn't afford my consumption level to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep my pain to the level where I'm fully
productive members of society.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would have to treat at least some of
my pain some other way that was not
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, cause I don't have a bunch of,
like, I don't have money to throw away on
pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 dogs and a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've got plenty of mouths to feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have money to be thrown away on
any sort of excess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if I had to buy what you produce
for me, even in a med shop, even in a med
[SPEAKER_03]: shop in Colorado that was giving me a
pretty decent, uh, assign us as your
[SPEAKER_03]: caregiver discounts, I would still be
paying at least 50% more than I am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not a full a hundred percent more than
I'm paying now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't get what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't get the quality or the quantity
that I'm getting right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't be able to get the
grateful dog that you asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know is Mike 's favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smelled it walking in people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't quite sure what it was because
it's been eight or nine months since I've
[SPEAKER_03]: had any, but I walked in the front door
and the first words out of my mouth was
[SPEAKER_03]: what is that delicious smell?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jeff laughed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the clothes he was trimming in
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stink like grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good segue, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you just said clothes you've been
trimming in ladies and Martha Farkin
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a box in the mail yesterday of these
fucking super sexy grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that logo vivid?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's taken one home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have got probably 15 of the 25
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like a grow from your heart
podcast t-shirt, the front of them has the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast logo without
my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have my face on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm wearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not like the hoodies with my face on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt weird wearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'm wearing the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can wear the one with my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure with your face, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm that asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my own face on my back, but I've got
the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, my face on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and large across the chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors are vivid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's red, yellow, and green is
Rastafari out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's putting up a hand signal,
trying to tell me something.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're handmade, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not handmade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were made by somebody that their
company is called handmade apparel because
[SPEAKER_00]: his name is Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just triple checking before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to handmade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge, super huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to handmade apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to say that and you'd be
like, oh no, you were correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl did these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, but the, uh, the handmade crew did
a super good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super speedy turnaround, uh, the quality
shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shirts are good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, uh, they're tagless and the,
uh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best thing since sliced bread was
always kind of dumb because since sliced
[SPEAKER_03]: bread was my whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sense tagless is what I think of that
now and that expression comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tag to tickle your neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my dreadlocks rub on the collar of
the shirt and push the tag into my back
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird, but on the back of the
shirt, ladies and gentlemen, it says take
[SPEAKER_00]: a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something funny about wearing a
shirt that says take a fat dab and give
[SPEAKER_00]: your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't worn it in public yet cause I
got it, uh, yesterday and I haven't gone
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but trust me, this will get worn
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I pretty much just wear, I read
genetics and grow from your heart t-shirts
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I'm at work, then they rock the veg
bloom shirts that they gave me at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going on a trip with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take it to Mexico and wear
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do wear it on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question mark face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get searched again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, when I saw the shot of the shirt,
I said, Hey babe, look, I finally have a
[SPEAKER_03]: shirt that I can wear that doesn't scream
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she shook her head.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, what part of that doesn't scream
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, it doesn't say anything
about weed on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's no pot leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, it's Rasta colors and it
says grow in giant letters from your heart
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, she didn't even see the back and
I just kind of put my head down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back does say take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're going on a trip and you know,
you're not taking anything illegal with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should wear that and be bait,
be a decoy so that some dude that does
[SPEAKER_00]: have drugs in his butt gets away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to take one for the
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've been to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, but, uh, their typical security
thing is you line up in customs and then
[SPEAKER_03]: like your little group, one of you pushes
the button and a stoplight in front of
[SPEAKER_03]: you, the red, yellow, green goes either
red or green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green means keep walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red means you don't keep walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're about to have a bad time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All your stuff is going to get dumped into
a pile and then randomly stuffed back in
[SPEAKER_03]: your suitcase angrily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to up the odds on that red
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know they've got to switch to be
like, this fucker's got dreads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red, red, red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've had my dreadlocks gone through by
a TSA agent before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this lady was like, what's in your
hat, honey?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, there's no hair in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she made me take off my hat and
she put on rubber gloves and went through
[SPEAKER_00]: my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's just hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm offended right now, but she didn't
give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you were
interested in one of these hella sexy grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast t-shirts,
I would love to put one on your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to get one in your hands.

[SPEAKER_00]: All you gotta do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, you'll have to shoot me a
PayPal payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you just have to email me.

[SPEAKER_00]: smoking some weed, if you're talking about
listening to Joe Rogan or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I'd just be like, Hey, do you listen
to the grow from your heart podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to do this at the beginning of the
show, but shout out to the spliff podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: with bone Alice and a shout out to the
dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've been doing a lot of shout outs
back and forth and I think that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing well for everybody.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Devin granny told me through text message
that she wants to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes, uh, shit comes up for dad
and granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so far she's in, we can't,
we can't promise that granny's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the day off work as everything
goes correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mike's got a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what the hell is going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go.

Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to do my, I'm in a similar
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a large girl and I have a growth
staff and I'm in charge of all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the boss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes shit explodes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as everything goes cool,
I'm just going to work another day and
[SPEAKER_00]: cover for somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my buddy needs a day off because it
could play soccer now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to cover for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to cover for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to the dude grows cup and
get roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so set a judge's pack aside for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send the email really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep procrastinating on that because I
want to see who else is coming with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to do it dude grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we come.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do one email, not 11 Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, your life is rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Bo was supposed to, uh, try to get out
to Colorado to do a podcast with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but her computer, uh, took a big fat giant
shit on her the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that travel money and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I've been trying to encourage Bo
to buy herself a Mac book instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking with windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that seems to be most of her
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and her high ass is a big part of her
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: She admitted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I might've just been high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably were Bo, but your other
problem is that you're fucking with the
[SPEAKER_00]: windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a two terabyte, uh, external hard
drive and a Mac book and I record onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac book and then I drop it all to the
external hard drive so that I've got it on
[SPEAKER_00]: both places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if something goes wrong,
it's right over there on the hard drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everything I've got backs up to
that hard drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I have to do is plug it in and the
computer just goes, Oh, there's that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it knows just back up right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bo, that's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Patreon,
if you want to support podcasters,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bo Nellis has a split podcast,
Patreon, and also I've got a girl from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart podcast, Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of us would appreciate it if you'd
help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just think about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants to keep doing her show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's got to not do a whole bunch of
stuff in her life so she can get new
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm looking at 50 odd blinky lights in
600 odd knobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need nearly that much equipment
to record this much, but there's a reason
[SPEAKER_03]: we sound this good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys, uh, if you're burning to
throw a dollar at somebody, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to patreon.com and search for the split
podcast, and then let Bo know that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you heard that she needed some help to
get her audio fixed up and let her know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're trying to help her out from
and make it, let her know that you heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about through us, you know, just don't,
don't give us credit, but let her know you
[SPEAKER_00]: heard from us so that she can get a little
smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like Rasta Jeff's helping us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to keep doing that show you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good fucking show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, we're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a dab of this lemon Jeffrey
sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I really want to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to wrap up this
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever let go of that baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you see another kid fall down,
uncle Joey taught me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the playground and you see
another kid fall down, don't look away
[SPEAKER_00]: from your kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking trap dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Joey taught me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get away for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, honestly, I just can't wait to
get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's the best part of a
vacation is getting home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's the vacation is the
culmination of like 50 things in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just personally, the election was
going to answer a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the way the election panned out
locally and statewide and nationally,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of that shit stayed up in the air
until now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally all the coins are landing and
I know if it's heads or tails and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: start moving forward, dude, I'm pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to get back from Mexico and get
that hurdle out of the way and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: feet on the ground running again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be back, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jesse Witt just text me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all we've got for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is it for this episode.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys we're fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take this step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I so hungry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, hungry like a hostage over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a
huge shout out to Tim, Charlie,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of my friends at Organ Tica in
Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing a great job down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to Mike for coming to
taking time away from the baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for you for this week
and until next time you guys take a fat
[SPEAKER_00]: dab and give your mama a hug for me.
I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: a cousin Dave, drove his
[SPEAKER_01]: car on the bus and it cost us three
dollars just to get halfway down to five
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourteen dollars didn't sleep so well and
the morning came with bells on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took to the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got something to eat and then we took to
the bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bottle of tequila and two fat cigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We painted the town some sort of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point a train girl threw my head
down in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: At five a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: we're still on our feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The couple's over to the side of the
street said something to me that I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: a cousin Dave, drove his car on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bus and it cost us
[SPEAKER_01]: three dollars.
