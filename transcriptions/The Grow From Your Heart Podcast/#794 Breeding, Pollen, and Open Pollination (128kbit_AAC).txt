[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 794 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a great show lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to give away a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've teamed up with our friends at seeds
here now.com to give away a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that later in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to remind
you that iry genetics will be at the dude
[SPEAKER_01]: grows cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, the dude grows cup is
happening again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, just outside of Fort Collins on
June 3rd, make sure to check out DGC cup
[SPEAKER_01]: .com for all of the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there will be a fresh drop and a
restock and new items on iry direct on
[SPEAKER_01]: April 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out iry direct on
April 1st for a brand new restock,
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh drops, new items, and of course,
a fat sale prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all the business we've got
to cover here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody let's jump into the grow help
part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a grow help tab on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to irygenetics.com on the top,
there are several tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them says grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your grow question on the
podcast, you will win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question on today's show came
from our friend who wants to be called
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Pot Smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big congrats to my friend, Johnny Pot
Smoker, because you have won a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds for sending me this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Ross, to Jeff, thank you for
taking time to read this grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, bro, thank you for taking the time to
send to this grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, can I start breeding with just
feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very common question I get a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I want to look into starting a
breeding project in my two by four tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: My issue was that my five by five tent
shares the same long room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I even risk it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow up question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I take feminized reverse pollen and
cross it with an auto flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy growing from our friend,
Johnny Pot Smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good series of questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You absolutely can breed with just
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the first part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can use fem seeds for your
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there will not be a male in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got feminized seeds,
all of those will be girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have to select one of those and
reverse it to use that as your pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: donor, or of course use non-feminized
seeds to find a boy to breed with that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, feminized seeds work just like
non-feminized seeds, other than the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're not going to get any males out
of that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have a myth or an idea or a
misconception that they cannot breed to a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that came from a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, those plants are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's talk about the, uh, I've bred
the lemon Jeffrey, which is one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that is a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have bred that to several other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the lemon sunrise is lemon Jeffrey to
arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings out a lot of traits from the
arise, a lot of traits from the lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a feminized to a regular,
and it works very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you absolutely can work your fems into
the breeding program any way that you see
[SPEAKER_01]: fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next part of the question,
um, should I risk it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my, uh, my five by five room and
my two by four share the same lung room
[SPEAKER_01]: with that lung room being the commonality
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not think I would risk it because the
pollen will get into the air and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: end up in both of those grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room you want seeded, uh, will be
fully seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room you don't want seeded will have
too many seeds in it just because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, uh, there's absolutely no
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lung room is what is going to move
the pollen from one place to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen is very fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend doing it a little bit
further away, which we will touch on on
[SPEAKER_01]: another question here in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your setup, no, I would not even
risk it because, uh, that lung room is
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to move that pollen right
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is going to be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, maybe you can learn how to do the
five by five room, put it into flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, get it flowered, uh, get it almost
done and then put the other room into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way the next time you fill the five
by five, it's only in veg and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do your seed breeding and the other room
have that side flowering while they're
[SPEAKER_01]: vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then get that done, uh, clean up all
the pollen before these plants go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should work out for you, but you
can't do both at the same time because I
[SPEAKER_01]: do fear that you will pollinate that
entire room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a third part to the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says my follow up question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I take feminized reversed pollen and
cross it with an auto flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: You absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what would happen then?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make feminized plants that
show some traits of auto flower and some
[SPEAKER_01]: traits that show regular photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is the first time you're crossing
it to that auto flower, there will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an, uh, I'm not an auto flower
breeder, but there will be a percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants that do come out auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're okay with having some of your
offspring be auto flower, some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring be regular photo period,
that is an acceptable idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step would be to cross that auto
flower to another auto flower again in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future to lock in that auto flower trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the route that you want to go,
only use auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were, your main goal is to make
auto flower plants because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're introducing into the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is yes, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The long answer is only do that if you
intend on working that auto flower trait
[SPEAKER_01]: in and making that a stable trait that
pops up amongst the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, question number one, you can breed
with fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they are just like regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not do it in the room with two
tents because you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, you can breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use feminized reversed pollen to
an auto flower, and it will make some
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are autos, some plants that
are rags.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Johnny Potsmoker, thank you for
the great series of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I answered your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do send me your address so I can
send you a free pack of iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course that seed giveaway is
sponsored by our friends at seeds here now
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at seeds here now
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need regular feminized or auto
flower seeds, I definitely recommend seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: here now.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message also came from the grow help
tab on iry genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called Shiggy smacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend Shiggy
smacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get too far Shiggy, please do
send me your address so that I can mail
[SPEAKER_01]: you a free pack of iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your message here on the
podcast, you do, you do win free beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I owe you a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here goes the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, let's say we take a female out of
the flower tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulled her out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we put it in a small separate tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real, real far, far away and pollinate it
with the super dope studs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far this is making sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question is, can I take that
female after I know it's been pollinated,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe just blow it off a bit, stick it
back in the flower tent and expect
[SPEAKER_01]: everything to be just peachy or will
residual pollen be left on the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen fertilize the other females?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if this is done correctly,
it will work the way that you want it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but keep in mind that pollen is
microscopic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the pollen that got on that plant got
in your hair and your clothes and your
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got dreadlocks, it's in your
eyelashes, it's in your eyebrows,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in your hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to get rid of that pollen
before we return to the sense of media
[SPEAKER_01]: room with no seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main way that I would recommend
doing that, uh, the main key to
[SPEAKER_01]: deactivating pollen is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would pollinate that plant in that
other room, leave it there for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pollinate twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like to hit the plant two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just ensures that I'm going to get
full pollination, lots of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would do my pollination process.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However I do it, put the plant,
uh, you said far, far away, real,
[SPEAKER_01]: real far, far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got two reels and two fars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're real, real far, far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put the female in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would wait a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would pollinate again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would wait a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then like you said, blow off all that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a way to dust off all that
pollen, that is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would take a bottle of just water
and mist my plant with water completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would almost drench that plant to where
it's running off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water is going to deactivate and kill
any of the pollen that is left on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but it will not damage our seeds or
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis plants are designed by nature to
be outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the trichomes purpose is to
protect that plant from rain and moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drench it down one time,
don't leave it locked in a room and get
[SPEAKER_01]: stagnant with no air, but let's spray it
down one time, leave the fans on and that
[SPEAKER_01]: will help deactivate the pollen and you
won't get any mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't get any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you're ready to move that plant
after it's been sprayed down, also spray
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself down, change your clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got dreadlocks like I do,
wrap them up when you're doing this or
[SPEAKER_01]: water them down, spray them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you be very careful because
pollen is microscopic and every little
[SPEAKER_01]: granule of pollen can equal one seed in
the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've watered down the plant,
sprayed on everything, wiped down the pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: wiped down everything that was in the room
with the pollen, including yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a shower, scrub down, get all that
pollen off of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this time, when I'm taking that
female plant into the general population
[SPEAKER_01]: with the other females, I would go in that
room and I would also spray down all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give them one good dusting with
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they're not able to receive any
stray pollen that may be in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just go in there and move that plant
in there and just do just a random willy
[SPEAKER_01]: nilly spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just coat everything with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way if there is any pollen that made
it in there that is floating around,
[SPEAKER_01]: we sprayed it once in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've treated ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've brought it to the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We treated the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're treating everything in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just triple check and make sure no
pollen gets into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do this correctly, everything
should be peachy like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the residual pollen that could be left
over will pollinate all of the pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: that it comes in contact with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that you do get every bit of
pollen either off of that plant and or
[SPEAKER_01]: deactivate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people take an air compressor
and just blow the pollen off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some water in the mix as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get some water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray those plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is the deactivator of pollen that
should rescue you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be responsible if you try
this and it does not go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, pollen is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen travels in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen will get stuck in your nose and
then you'll sneeze it back out later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen is microscopic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it moves very freely through the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dust a plant, if you shake a plant
making pollen, watch how that pollen just
[SPEAKER_01]: lingers in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the smaller pieces will just stick
around in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much longer than you anticipate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take good care of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be really careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be peachy, but it is very
possible that you will pollinate the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire fucking room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my friend, Shiggy Smacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do send me your address because I
owe you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend,
Midget Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend, Midget Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Midget Dog, please make sure to send me
your address because I do owe you a pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of ivory genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, those seeds are sponsored by
our friends at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to them for hosting and
promoting and sponsoring a seed giveaway
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question says, I have a general grow
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plan is to grow a pack of Jack Tripper
and do an open pollination with all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, no individual selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says, I know I won't know the
baby daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are doing an open pollination to
make F2s, that's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to see a lot of diversity
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see all the phenotypical
expressions and you will find what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want in that F2 population by doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I want no individual selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then hunt the highest potency of the
female to find high potency male to
[SPEAKER_01]: further breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good strategy,
but don't get too hung up on the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: potency is the only thing you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need resistance to pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need resistance to any kind of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to make sure that there's no
intersex problem in these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't stay too focused on just potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of other factors that
should help you determine if this plan is
[SPEAKER_01]: worth growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's continue though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question I have is, have you ever
seen intersex traits on a female after it
[SPEAKER_01]: has received pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never seen a plant that has
received pollen show me intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time when I'm working with
plants, I've grown them multiple times
[SPEAKER_01]: before I choose to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that that intersex is not going
to pop up before or after pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little bit of a vetting
process to be done before I generally
[SPEAKER_01]: breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're going to take these
Jack Trippers and just go for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which sounds like a fun project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see intersex traits in those
Jack Trippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody out there has ever reported an
intersex problem with the Jack Trippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see any intersex traits pop up
in there, but we'll stick with the
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen intersex traits on a
female after it has received pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that more common in centibud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is totally more common in
centibud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something happens with the hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that plant has been pollinated,
it's very unlikely to show intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have any science behind
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I am just planning to do the F2
then select a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured if I did it this way,
I'm kind of mixing up the breeding pot a
[SPEAKER_01]: little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you are shaking the breeding lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting everything that you could
possibly pull every phenotype imaginable,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're not going to call any
phenotypes either male or female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the tall, skinny one,
the short, squatty one, the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: smells like lemons, the one that smells
like dryer sheets, the one that smells a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit like piss, the one that smells
like lavender, the one that is real tall
[SPEAKER_01]: and skinny, the one that's super high
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find all of those
phenotypes, maybe different combinations
[SPEAKER_01]: of those phenotypes by mixing up that open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we talk about open pollination for
a second?
[SPEAKER_01]: We will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, by adding in the Pandora box of
F2, I hope to find a Jack Tripper F2 male
[SPEAKER_01]: that carries on a rocket ship potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says, I'm two years out,
ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to pheno hunt the ladies
first, which sounds like a really good,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's going to do the open pollination,
grow some, find the ladies, then look for
[SPEAKER_01]: a male with that rocket potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're ready, bro, I'd love to run a
10, maybe a 20 pack of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Colorado, so I will run 12 of them
because that is my legal limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to run a few of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what you have F2, from my creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always fun to see, especially
because now let's talk about, I said open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do not practice the open
pollination sort of technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very selective type of breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have kind of touched on it a moment
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when this person is going to put
an entire pack of Jack Tripper seeds in a
[SPEAKER_01]: room and not select any boys, not select
any girls, but just let the pollen fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will probably be somewhere between
four and six boys and four and six girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have, I'm just going to
say five and five, because it makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to remember and balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have five male plants
putting pollen on five different girl
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, but it's not going to be male one
to male two to male two to male two or
[SPEAKER_01]: however I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be plant A and plant A
and plant B and plant B.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be all of the mixes of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male number A is going to pollinate plant
number one, two, three, four, and five.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also on the same plant will be seeds
that were made with the pollen from male
[SPEAKER_01]: number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on the same plant will be seeds made
from male number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have five female plants
with five different baby daddy seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see, what is that 250,000
different combinations is the way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there might be more zeros on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be 2,500,000 different
combinations that you come in and stick
[SPEAKER_01]: with the 250,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of different combinations
of phenotypical expression you could
[SPEAKER_01]: really come up with this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be a really fun
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when you open some seeds and
just put them all in the room and just let
[SPEAKER_01]: them have a big, big old orgy in there,
no selection, no elimination, no culling,
[SPEAKER_01]: just letting it happen the way that nature
would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts off a lot of amazing,
interesting phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like our friend understands
that they are going to open a Pandora's
[SPEAKER_01]: box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, they will select
their winners for the next breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're doing everything
that you should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the main question was if I have
seen the intersex traits on a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's something I've never seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never seen intersex and the Jack
Tripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are off to a very good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have one more question here in
front of me, but again, I will do my best
[SPEAKER_01]: to get those seeds out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't worry, I do verify that your
question was on the show before I send you
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to scam me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says, Hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one of your episodes, you say an S1 is
when you take two clones of the same plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and reverse one and pollinate the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the reversed plant pollinate itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this considered an S1 as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep the great knowledge coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is absolutely an S1 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I don't recommend or prefer
that is because when it comes to reversing
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant, I like to put the reversed plant
into flower a little bit sooner than the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that will receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just a timing issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start spraying the plant two
weeks before you put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen donor needs to be sprayed two
weeks to 10 days before it goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to spray that at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I need to put that plant into flower
in seven to 10 days from the first spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it needs to be sprayed every third
day for the next about 21 to 24 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get about seven to 10 total
sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at some point, I need to put my
female plants into flower to catch up with
[SPEAKER_01]: that male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pollen comes out at the right time
when the pistols are ripe on the female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I don't prefer to do this to
the same plant is because those pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: and that pollen don't time up as good as
they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wait to put my female plants into
flower, when I see that male plant just
[SPEAKER_01]: showing signs of being reversed,
I know what a female plant looks like when
[SPEAKER_01]: it begins to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little variation when the
reversal was successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start where the plant will start to
make a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes just a little thing that looks
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nub and it's going to be an anther
eventually, but I can identify it soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I see those, that's when the
female plant goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, the pollen comes out at the
right time when the pistols are ripe on
[SPEAKER_01]: the female plant to receive that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to do it on the same plant,
the pollen will come out way too early and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pistols won't be ripe enough or the
pistols will be overripe and the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: won't come out soon enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just plant dependent, strain
dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants really want pollen earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants want pollen a lot later in the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two plants that make a really good example
of that situation are the strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, which makes strawberry starburst,
and the platinum tangy, which makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun kiss, also makes the orangegasm,
but that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants, they want pollen at
completely different times, about a week
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The platinum tangy is ready for pollen
super early.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, hey, pollen Amy, here I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry fields plant is standing in
the room going, bitch, you early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's just looking at her like,
I'm going to wait for the good pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that strawberry starburst plant is a
full week behind the platinum tangy for
[SPEAKER_01]: when it wants pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sitting back waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still booming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still developing like a plant should,
but those pistols, those sexual organs of
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant are just not ready to receive
the pollen yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that I do my plant
separately, the reason that I time the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant separately is just to get them into
the room at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is your first attempt at doing any
breeding, if this is your first attempt at
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds, this will work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't make as many seeds as you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did this to two different plants,
you could definitely make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about you're reversing one side and
not reversing the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to spray a couple of
branches or one branch of a plant very
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently and make sure not to spray the
other branches of that plant because the
[SPEAKER_01]: one you spray will reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants are very stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants, if you don't spray the whole
thing, it won't reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hormones over here tell the hormones
over here, nah, and they just,
[SPEAKER_01]: they argue about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, this one will reverse halfway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one will flower halfway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both sides will look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you'll be trying to reverse
the right side of the plant and keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: left side of the plant non-reversed and
the plant just doesn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hormones are just not allowing that to
happen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a more a sativa dominant
tropical type of a plant that that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes some of the OG Kush type plants
don't even want to reverse at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants are stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's muddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much easier to have an individual
isolated plant that you are attempting to
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can reverse that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I understand when my plants go
into flower and when they want pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get that male into the flower
room, get him flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I could drag in that strawberry
starburst plant and get her a head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a few days later, I could bring in
the platinum tangy plant, get them right
[SPEAKER_01]: on schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when the pollen comes, both of those
plants are going to produce maximum amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your idea will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's your first idea, your first
attempt, you will bang out some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the one side reverses and the
other side stays true, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is plant specific, but it should work
for you in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do recommend two separate
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the main question was,
will this still be an S1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is absolutely still an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken pollen from a specific
cultivar and we've pollinated that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific cultivar with that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's female pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a female plant that is a feminized S1
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this, let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how you decided to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you stick with one plant being the
pollen donor and the pollen giver,
[SPEAKER_01]: or did you decide to use two plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many female plants did you put in the
room?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my overall question is going to
be, how many seeds did you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you grown them and what are they
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Smurf Girl, thank you for the
