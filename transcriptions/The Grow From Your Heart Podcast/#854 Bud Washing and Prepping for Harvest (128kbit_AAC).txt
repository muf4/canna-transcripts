[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 854 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's episode, I'm going to answer a
question about bud washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to that part of the show,
I want to do a couple of shout outs to a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of folks who support the show on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's kick it off with a big Grow From
Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend Levity Love Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you
shout out to Zoso J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to my
friend Ars Kickerson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to support the show on
Patreon, make sure you check Patreon.com
[SPEAKER_01]: forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I think that's all of the
business at the front of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the email portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question came from my website,
I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says grow help right at the top of the
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me a grow question and I read
your question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my new friend Mitch, make sure you
check your inbox and check your spam
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got a coupon code for a
free pack of seeds at I read direct.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it is getting toward the end of
the outdoor season for us here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mitch, I'm not sure that I'll be able
to ship you seeds in Canada via the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian what's it called Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not let me send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will get rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will get returned to me with the
letter saying please stop doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So send me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you a shirt or a hoodie or
something out there for your prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it is nearing the outdoor
harvest season in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in Colorado and many other places
across our beautiful continent here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, do you have or have you ever
washed your outdoor crop for outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, is there a process that you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have done this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen this done a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually washed an indoor crop
because of facility that I worked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hired me to kind of rescue this
facility and they were in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering phase and that crop had a bunch
of weird stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dirt and debris and possibly bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like it was pretty filthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we even washed an indoor crop just to
be extra careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, let's talk about this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been out there for at least nine
or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had big fat sticky buds on them
for probably four or five of those weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within that time frame, those plants have
probably gathered a lot of just natural
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt and dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you go out there, your feet
kick up dirt and dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time the wind comes by, more dirt
and dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not see it, but it is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of dust and dirt
traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time the wind comes by, every time
your feet stomp, every time a car drives
[SPEAKER_01]: by, I don't know where your plants are,
but shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust and dirt do happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are in the air and your
plants should, hopefully, they should be
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky, sticky plants, dust in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get dusty, dirty plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just naturally how it's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because you're dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because outside is dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because wind, dirt, dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how shit works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you're going to start with a
little bit of dirt and dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a good chance for a little
bit of bird poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times has a bird flown over your
garden and taken a poop?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a whole bunch of yardage,
more opportunity for more bird poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be a bird turd you don't even
know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's more stuff that could end up on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we're going to get a lot of bugs,
not just the bugs that you're used to on
[SPEAKER_01]: your ganja plants, but bugs that may have
just been traveling through.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize that that plant was a
sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walked up against that cush plant and
got stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got a ladybug here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a little beetle over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find stuff like that where
there's bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what else you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bug poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be bug poop on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying is outdoors,
you may have the opportunity for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: funky shit to develop on these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is never a bad idea to wash these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people may be freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're thinking you're going to put the
plants in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to put the plants in a
solution and wet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: These outdoor plants have probably been,
possibly been hit by rain and moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of rinse will not harm
them, will not do them any harm if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you people that say that's how you
make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're not going to add the ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do it as aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different of a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, very similar, but we're not going
to damage the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's jump right into the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing left to do here,
but talk about the process of how I would
[SPEAKER_01]: go about washing some of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down a very short very simple
standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a responsible adult, as somebody who is
giving guidance and teaching people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should start off by saying, I'm going to
tell you to use a couple of products or
[SPEAKER_01]: one of two products mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you use this product or these
products, please use all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use any of these products and you
do harm, hurt, damage yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: others, your plants, your stuff,
I am not responsible because I'm telling
[SPEAKER_01]: you right now, read the fucking label,
do it properly, be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend good nitrile gloves,
six millimeter, six M or thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to say six M is what it
says in the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six M or thicker gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's millimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six millimeter gloves or thicker is what
we would recommend in the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want gloves for sure, especially
while you're mixing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The undiluted products that I'm going to
tell you to use are very caustic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will damage your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get white burns on your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of does hurt if it goes deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get it in your eyes, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wear some goggles, especially while
pouring and mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend gloves and goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you could do a long sleeve shirt,
always wear pants and shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to be as covered as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got dreadlocks, tie those up,
get them covered up, cover up any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hair you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do not want this on your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want it in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will burn your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use one of two products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use one of these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not use both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need both.
[SPEAKER_01]: One may be easier to find than the other,
depending on your location, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of a hurry you were in,
depending on your budget is the word I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two products I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would start with a product called Zero
Tall, not the one from Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another Zero Tolerance product
from Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want Zero Tall, the one that smells
like hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the Zero Tall product you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the product I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other product I would recommend is the
30 or 35% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I recommend using gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these products are caustic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will burn your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will burn the shit out of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use gloves, use goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last time I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a responsible grower, responsible
adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have got either the Zero Tall or the
35 or 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I recommend we need is a
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing, guess what we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some water, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to fill this five gallon
bucket up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave a little bit of room because we're
going to be dunking shit in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allow room for displacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to top it off a little bit
later as you go because water will spill
[SPEAKER_01]: out and water is going to disappear into
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a five gallon bucket is the next step
that I recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would put, depending on how dirty
your product is, depending on how hard you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to go with these products,
I would start with somewhere between 25
[SPEAKER_01]: and 50 milliliters of the 33% hydrogen
peroxide or Zero Tall in a five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 25 to 50 milliliters in a five
gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have about four and a half,
four and three quarters of a gallon of
[SPEAKER_01]: water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 25 to 50 milliliters of this product,
depending on how dirty you think your crop
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got powdery mildew, maybe go up
to the 50 milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have any powdery mildew,
you could start lower and work your way up
[SPEAKER_01]: and watch the water and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to pour in either one of
the two products, not both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to put Zero Tall or hydrogen
peroxide at 25 to 50 milliliters while
[SPEAKER_01]: wearing gloves and goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it'd be the last time I lied to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stir that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the word, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it all stirred up properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then basically what we're going to do,
we're going to chop the plants into
[SPEAKER_01]: manageable pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you cut the plant properly,
think about you're cutting the plant from
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work your way down, there's a point
where that main branch is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another branch coming off of the
side, just a little short shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut below that, and you can use that
little short shoot as a hook to hang that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant upside down or to hang that branch
upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeat that process all the way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I usually do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would cut a branch off or cut a
section off, a node.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what I would do while wearing my
gloves, I would just dunk, chop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then dunk that straight into that
hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all of the flower part in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got buds all the way up here,
go all the way to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunk that into the hydrogen peroxide
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a couple of swirls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go too crazy, just a couple of
swirls, and you'll see what floats out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got powdery mildew, you watch
that powdery mildew break off and float
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's bug shit, bird shit,
bug eggs, bugs, dirt, dust, debris,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff is just going to float
right up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull that flower, pull that branch,
that flower out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the other option, some people do this,
some people don't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give it a rinse and another bucket
of just clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will go from that hydrogen
peroxide bucket into a clean water rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, I put it on a,
I use like a hanger like you would for a
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt, the same exact hangers I buy for
all my t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy another bundle of hangers and then I
hang those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should probably talk about
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about more of that part in
detail toward the end, but I will use that
[SPEAKER_01]: coat hanger and I'll put two or three of
these wet branches on there and hang those
[SPEAKER_01]: on a line or something which we're going
to talk about in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dunk it, give it a good swirl,
and hang it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not that much of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, my notes are five gallon bucket,
30 to 50 milliliters, gloves and goggles,
[SPEAKER_01]: chop, dunk, swish, hang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says optional, second rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically how you do a bud
wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like it would sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take these fresh buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fresh buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this when the plant is wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to stress that right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this while the plant is fresh and wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want this like literally chop,
dunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do chop, dunk, like in that
quick of a process, maybe chop the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, move it to the area, chop it into
manageable pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that little part I said we're
using the one, the hook is your little
[SPEAKER_01]: hanger piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chop mindfully with hooks and then chop
them, dunk them, swish them around,
[SPEAKER_01]: hang them up, and then get them to your
dry and cure area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's focus a little bit on the area
where we are going to hang these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are going to be dripping
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just dunk them into a bucket of water
and possibly into another bucket of water
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're choosing to do the second
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be dripping water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend doing this somewhere where you
can just get the floor completely soaked
[SPEAKER_01]: and not have too much of an issue
stressing over it, or you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to mop up that water frequently or manage
that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one of the facilities where I did this,
we had a fully concrete floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it wasn't too big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water dripped out into the concrete
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made a little mess right under the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a fan on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dried up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't too big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In another place we did it, we did it out
doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just dripped onto the ground and not
too big of a deal, but keep in mind there
[SPEAKER_01]: will be water dripping out of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot of water depending on the
size of your plants, the size of your
[SPEAKER_01]: buds, but there will be water dripping
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about having a way to move that
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want some airflow in there and you
want some water to be removed from these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and from the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want this to happen at a natural slow
pace, but you may want a few fans in that
[SPEAKER_01]: room to move that air around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want any stagnant water sitting
anywhere, so don't have a fan just blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: on the plant the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to piss things off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have it passing occasionally and just have
it moving and mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have all your fans moving together
in sync.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the air mixing and moving and try to
have some sort of extraction, moving that
[SPEAKER_01]: air out of that area, that water out of
that area where those plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back to my notes and get myself
back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high as shit and rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a dab of lemon butter rum and it's
got me going a million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang them dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a fan on there, but not direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The floor is going to get wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need a dehumidifier depending on
the size of your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dehumidifier will help you out
drastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep the room just like when you're
drying and curing around 50 to 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity and also about 60
degrees if you possibly can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people argue about parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not super picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that 50 to 60 percent relative
humidity range.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I give you a range, nobody can argue.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me stay on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The floor is going to be wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get lots of air exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can move the air in and out of that
room, like get that humid air out and
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh air in that room, that will help
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't want these wet buds to get
stale, funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you'll start to get problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want any stagnant air at this
time because we've got wet, soggy buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just purposely dunked these buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are super wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gentle fans and lots of air exchange is
underlined twice on this page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you got fans in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving the air around, mixing and moving
that air, not blowing directly on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because that will piss them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they're just drying, they'll dry
too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still want to slow dry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to get this water out and
then actually restart the regular dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: cure process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once this water is gone, it makes
depending on the size of your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could take four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could take 24 hours to get back to
where you started before you dunked them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, depends on the room and the size
of the plants, the density of the buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of factors there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a lot of airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air exchange, a dehumidifier may be an
option at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need some ducting to suck the air
out of that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your setup, but I want you to
be prepared for this before we even get
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mindful when you are hanging these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about putting them on a hanger
and hanging them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mindful when you are hanging up these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want them touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want them pressed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a couple of inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least be able to put your hands between
every plant, between every branch that's
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging so that we do not get any water
trapped in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can go in there and move them
around, you'll notice that no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: much air flow you put in that room,
you're going to have micro climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the buds over here are going to
dry more quickly than some of the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not just swap them places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to go in there and move
shit around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a very good option.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that's been right by the fan for
three hours, put it way over here and put
[SPEAKER_01]: some new shit that hasn't been near the
fan by the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just adjust and keep those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a lot of love, care,
and attention is basically what I'm trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mindful when you're hanging those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be prepared before you start chopping
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I should have talked
about in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you even cut down, before you think
about cutting down the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: before you put on your gloves and get your
big cutting shears or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: your chainsaw, whatever you're using,
be prepared 100% for this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have your buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have your peroxide or your zero tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have your gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have your goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a table and some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, this is going to be a
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to give yourself a clean, safe,
sanitary workspace that you're proud of,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to be comfortable in,
depending on how many plants you may be at
[SPEAKER_01]: this for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it something you're proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you prepare, the more you will
have success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds like some shit that dad
would say, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dad and I'm fucking right,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you prepare, the better chance
you have for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, the more chance you have to
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just clean up the space around you,
get the things you need on the table,
[SPEAKER_01]: have everything you need before you start
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes time to do it, it's so
smooth that it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are high fiving each other,
whoever's with you, instead of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, bro, go get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, shit, we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh man, we got everything we
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it super smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get everything you need before you even
start chopping the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having everything you need also
includes having the room ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some notes here that I did
overlook, airflow, temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, and security.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these plants are going somewhere,
you need to have airflow in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get the temperature and
humidity right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about those things, but I did not
talk about security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to put this harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is this harvest going to go once you
chop it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been growing for a while outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knew you had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cut it down, if anybody was
looking, they'll know those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: gone and they'll know they are hanging
somewhere too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be somebody out there looking
for those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to make you paranoid,
but I want to make you aware that people
[SPEAKER_01]: were looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were probably a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody you know knows that these plants
just got harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your neighbors has been looking
over the fence every day and they saw
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go, oh, I wonder where
they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how people in my neighborhood
think, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the shit I've got to prepare for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to tell you to think about
security and safety of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they going to go when you cut
them down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a locked area where you can
put them?
[SPEAKER_01]: A garage?
[SPEAKER_01]: A safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Double think about your security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about everybody you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got cameras, now's the time to
adjust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them focused on where these plants
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, security is a huge issue right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about having all of the
shit that we need before we even start
[SPEAKER_01]: chopping down these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to not just be around the
chopping of the plants initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to lead us into the full
harvest process and also leading up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: trim process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a dry trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let the plants dry before I trim them,
but the time between chopping them down
[SPEAKER_01]: and trimming them could be 7, 10,
14 days, depending on your location,
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things will come into play here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we cut down these plants,
be ready all the way to chop them down,
[SPEAKER_01]: dunk them, hang them, keep them preserved
to where they dry and cure slowly,
[SPEAKER_01]: then be ready to trim them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the thought process I want you to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's all one week long work process,
maybe a two long, maybe even longer for
[SPEAKER_01]: some of you folks out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you guys will be cutting down till
New Year's, but be prepared now so that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit goes correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I gave this same speech last year
now that I'm talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I gave this exact talk last year
now that I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check that episode for the
things that I missed on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Combine them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have the turbo harvest prep
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things we're going to need for this
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned them before, gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to buy a fresh pack of gloves,
the box of gloves right before harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: time in multiple sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's coming over to help you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to have friends,
helpers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who may be helping you trim this crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your girlfriend helping you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your best friend helping you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is another grow partner helping you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you all wear the same size gloves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say order, find out who's coming
over, what size gloves they wear and order
[SPEAKER_01]: them or go buy them as soon as possible so
you've got them before the harvest starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scissors for each person to trim and also
bigger scissors to cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have some sort of shears,
some sort of chopper, a chainsaw,
[SPEAKER_01]: a handsaw, anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need something to cut that plant down
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger the plant, the more cutting
power you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fuck your hand up by buying the
wrong tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy the right tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will cut smoothly if you do it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of hangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to cut down the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to cut it into smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dunk it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to swish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to rinse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hang it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my system, it goes onto a coat hanger,
and that coat hanger hangs on a line that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes across a full room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an eye hook on that side of the
room, an eye hook on that side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: room, and a piece of fishing line goes
across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hang all of the hangers on that
fishing line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you know how to tie a real good
knot so that shit doesn't fall in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the night and freak you out and
piss you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wet weed hitting the dirty floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is frustrating, especially after
you've already dunked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hang that shit up properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One fish eye here, one fish eye here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a cable, a fishing line,
a good twine going across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I put two or three little branches on
each coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang those coat hangers up on that
fishing line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever you need to get that line
system going, you can do a vertical rack
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to use chicken wire and put
coat hangers or just branches of weed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the chicken wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spread them out properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of ways to do it,
but start thinking about that now before
[SPEAKER_01]: we cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got gloves, scissors,
hangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A line or a rack to hang that shit on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to get into the small
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some rubbing alcohol to clean all of your
scissors and all your shit because
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's going to get sticky during
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, all the hippies use coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get your fingers all sticky,
you need to get the sticky off your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers out of your arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coconut oil works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go buy a fresh jar of coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dish some of it out for each person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's tacky as shit sticking
everybody's hand in the same coconut oil
[SPEAKER_01]: jar, but dish some out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bring your own coconut oil,
but that will clean your hands real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the sticky off there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also works to clean your scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little coconut oil in a dish,
set the scissors in there, rub them,
[SPEAKER_01]: massage it off that the sticky will come
right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some snacks, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming and harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: People forget about eating and how long
it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some ice in that cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some good fucking drinks in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask everybody that's coming over.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like to drink?
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks know that I like coconut water,
Fiji water, and a good lime flavored
[SPEAKER_01]: Haritos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the drinks that your friends like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard to stop by the store
and pick up a few drinks, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're coming over to help you trim and
harvest your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be there for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be smoking and laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be worth the whatever it
costs to go get a couple of sodas,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer not to have alcohol at the trim
party, but if you've got responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: friends who may want a glass of wine or
one beer, that's your place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you want to do, but go grab a
couple of drinks for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a Haritos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike would be just happy with a Haritos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in and grab in the drinks that your
friends and your trim crew want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shows that you want them to be there
and you want them comfortable and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will trim longer and they will be happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get them some snacks and drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also tip your trim crew at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're paying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what kind of deal you've got
worked out, but a little tip of some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: always makes people happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come back tomorrow, trim harder,
trim better, and they'll remember you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody likes a little bit of a tip
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the trim crew is going,
yeah, bro, fucking tip me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't steal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to listen to your music all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tip me the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I wrote down here,
I talked about this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't rub your eyes, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not rub your eyes when you're trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your eye itches, if your nose itches,
don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as soon as you touch your eyeball,
when you've been trimming, it is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichomes in your eyes are one of the
worst things ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually I remember doing a video
about this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, when you're trimming, when you're
harvesting, don't touch your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that sticky shit ends up in your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the worst feeling you will ever
endure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on from that,
because I remember saying this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when we're setting up for harvest
and trimming, if you've got people coming
[SPEAKER_01]: over for a while, be mindful and courteous
of the podcasts and or music that you
[SPEAKER_01]: play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my music.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're into something extreme like
I like fish, I know that fish,
[SPEAKER_01]: the band Fish is not everybody's cup of
cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to try something smart ass to
say, but it's not everybody's cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may play some fish, but not enough to
make you want to punch yourself in the
[SPEAKER_01]: face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, it's only one or two songs,
so they do want to punch themselves in the
[SPEAKER_01]: face for fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll throw down one good song and we
heard fish and we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But think about who's coming over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not telling you what to do at your
place, but the trimmers will trim better
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll stick around longer if they're
happier and they'll come back to trim more
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you play fucking Cannibal Corpse all
day for the wrong crowd, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if Joe's coming over,
play Cannibal Corpse all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a friend named Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will listen to Cannibal Corpse with us
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not everybody wants the same shit like
that all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be courteous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody wants to listen to Joe Rogan
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody wants to listen to Legion of
Skanks all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to be mindful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm saying, guys, is if you want the
trim crew to come back, give them what
[SPEAKER_01]: they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't run them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't scare them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show them that you care about them and
that they're invited and that you like
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what else do we got for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Comfortable chairs, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good comfortable chair at the right
height will make a trimmer trim much
[SPEAKER_01]: longer or take a lot more smoke breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're set up too low and you're
hunched and you're fucking struggling all
[SPEAKER_01]: day, all of your back is going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those trimmers are going to need more
snack breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take more phone breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take more cigarette
breaks just to get out of that damn chair
[SPEAKER_01]: and stretch around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them walking around your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them wandering outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just be doing other shit than
trimming because the chairs suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to have good, comfortable chairs
and good, comfortable seating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a table at a reasonable height that
matches those fucking chairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also trim bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get some kind of trim tray or
trim bin that a trimmer can set directly
[SPEAKER_01]: in their lap and be comfortable with and
trim right on their own lap, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: ergonomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy the good trim bins,
ergonomical, that's the right word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good for their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can sit with proper posture and they
can get the trim bin on their arms or on
[SPEAKER_01]: the table and they can trim how they need
it and not have to do weird shit with
[SPEAKER_01]: their neck and back and shoulders and
arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it just seems like they're sitting
there all day listening to music,
[SPEAKER_01]: eating snacks, but guys, it is taxing on
your body to trim for more than two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts to suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the proper gear, the proper
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of proper gear and proper setup,
how about good lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some good bright lighting,
but also not overwhelming lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right color of lighting, the bright
white lighting really helps for trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get the lights closer to the
trim area, that's even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some places offer a little movable lights
for some of the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen places offer the lights with the
magnifying glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're older, if you're going blind,
you can trim from far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my buddy, Gabe Line Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even trim at the trim crew now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got tools for you, although I don't
want to give that guy scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about good lighting,
good gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, think about all of this before
you start cutting down the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see you in a situation
where you just chop down a plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got it sitting on a table or
hanging up somewhere precariously while
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to run to the hardware store
and run to the grocery store and go get a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of snacks and a couple of five
gallon buckets and some whatever else you
[SPEAKER_01]: forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather you just be super prepared now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to give you a heads up and a
list of the things that I use and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: may use when it comes to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get your space ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a space ready not only to chop down
and do the work, but a space to hang all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that harvest, however much harvest
you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take about probably,
I don't know how well you did,
[SPEAKER_01]: but think at least half of that space
where you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need that much space to
hang this and let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start prepping for your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start prepping your space where you're
going to do the work and where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do the hang and where you're
going to do the trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also the dry and cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have something to dry and cure this
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not even get that far in my little
talk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got us up to trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as far as I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need bins to collect the
trimmed flowers in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need bins for the trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need trash bags for all
the waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to go all the way up to right
to the point of dry and cure, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely going to need more scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to clean those
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scissors for each person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have two pairs of scissors per
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when one gets too sticky, drop the
other one in the alcohol or the coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the other pair for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that other pair soak anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting nonsensical now talking about
all the small details, but as time goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on, you're going to need trash bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need trim trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need containers for all of
the buds that have been trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got trim crew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're chopping shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have waste that's got to
go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do with all the
waste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a big harvest, you're going
to have a bunch of sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be comfortable putting
all those sticks in the outdoor trash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a fire pit that maybe you
could burn those in out in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a little party?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just randomly throw some of those sticks
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of them that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do with all the
trim?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to make edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know somebody that can make
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of the trimmers want some of
the trim as a tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might want to go make their own
edibles or something with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a strategy for all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have storage for all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do with the trimmed
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have jars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have buckets?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen to all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to dry and cure it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen, chukers,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts.
