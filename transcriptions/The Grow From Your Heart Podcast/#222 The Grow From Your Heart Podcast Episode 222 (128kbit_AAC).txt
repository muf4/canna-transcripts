that, but that's the greatest way to start
[SPEAKER_11]: a podcast ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much how you got to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to do something unexpected.
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't know my voice had voices like
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like true sirens of the 710 world.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of turned on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got all kinds of emotions going on
over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not want it to stop at all,
ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing we want to stop- Hey man,
we could do that for about four hours and
[SPEAKER_07]: we haven't done it before.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do the outro for four hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our special bread song that we just
made up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exclusive genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bread.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bread.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I want to know the cross?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say before we get off topic,
we do want to make sure we say- We need to
[SPEAKER_11]: end the no-melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nebraska needs to stop in the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to have stuff that melts.
[SPEAKER_07]: People just need to stop making no-melt
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about the no-melt, it's about the
melt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get back on the J-Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get back on the J-Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to need to make a glossary of
terms to go with the podcast, but if
[SPEAKER_11]: you're not with it, you're not with it
today, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, let me explain what no-melt
Nebraska is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start it off with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's introduce you before you
explain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies and gentlemen, speaking on the mic
right now that is about to give us a
[SPEAKER_11]: lesson in no-melt Nebraska is Jordan from
Turpex.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know about Turpex, you got to find
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been dabbing mad Turpex for the
past two or three weeks and Turpex has put
[SPEAKER_11]: a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just dabbed some chem-dog nectar.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm lit up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, I'm going to turn it back over to
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_11]: No-melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So no-melt Nebraska is basically any hash
that doesn't melt, essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because basically, if you were to imagine
making hash in Nebraska, most of it would
[SPEAKER_07]: probably not be very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just we were thinking,
where's the state that has the least melty
[SPEAKER_04]: hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that is exactly where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ended up being Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about the hash that doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just call it Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the song was derived when my
friend Jordan here came home with a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of no-melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Had someone come down back when we lived
in Northern California, came down from
[SPEAKER_07]: Mendocino, was talking for weeks about
this awesome, amazing granddaddy purple
[SPEAKER_07]: hash that he was going to be bringing
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me tell you, when he brought that
down, turned into straight biscuits on the
[SPEAKER_07]: straight biscuits on the nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: And instead of getting a bubble,
you just get no, nothing really happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of sits there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes to a light brown.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't really get any smoke in the
piece or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just like burnt.
[SPEAKER_11]: The face I'm making does not convey on
radio at all, but I'm making this face.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if you've ever smelled burnt hair,
I'm making the face that happens when you
[SPEAKER_11]: smell burnt hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our buddy John John just walked in and
he's getting... I fucking love this group
[SPEAKER_11]: of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've got a dad for you over here also
after you take that full-melt dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or mostly melt dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of melt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will say this for everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if you don't understand all of
the verbiage nomenclatures going on today,
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely write in to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast and ask for a definition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my name's Richard and I don't
understand what that nomenclature word is
[SPEAKER_07]: that you just said.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm frankly, I'm offended.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everybody can be on the level.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure it's verbiage,
not verbiage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Verbiage?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's verbiage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Verbiage.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an E.
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Captain Grammar.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the nature boy, Ric Flair.
[SPEAKER_11]: To my mostly left over here, I'm going to
say, what's that, like 11 o'clock?
[SPEAKER_11]: You're about the 1130 position over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to say, you know... 1137.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to give you 1130 because that's
420 plus 710.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is my buddy Hunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the Grammy gaffer over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_11]: I am ecstatic to finally be on the podcast
after months of fucking talking about it
[SPEAKER_11]: and getting called out by my boy,
Irene for not listening and trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: listen and playing it at our shop and
doing everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally am fucking here spitting grammar
on the mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're finally here.
I'm here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in the Terp Mansion.
[SPEAKER_11]: I call this the Terpy Trap House.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, no, you haven't been to my house.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've invaded their dining area.
[SPEAKER_11]: I stepped on their dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've made myself home here.
[SPEAKER_11]: He literally just, you know, walked in,
kicked the dog, grabbed the e-nail and set
[SPEAKER_07]: up a mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dog is asking for a kicking,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: That dog came right back and tried to hump
your ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes it rough, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably smelled the ham wallet.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you had to sneak in the word ham
wallet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you get points for that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a couple.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys want any more ham wallets?
[SPEAKER_11]: Ham pocket, moose knuckle, ninja foot.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Spitting Viper.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be a Grammy show.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we brought our friend the
Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_11]: They only bring me for a reason and that's
to not act my age.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank you for getting,
you set this up.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is your fault that all this chaos is
here on the show and I appreciate it,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm also going to give a huge
shameless plug to Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis on 212 South 21st Street in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I do work for a dispensary in
Pueblo, but they don't have the turpax and
[SPEAKER_11]: I come up to Green and Healthy Cannabis to
get the turpax and also the Shula.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that Shula is raw, boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost as raw as the brine.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're ever in Colorado Springs,
212 South 21st Street in between Colorado
[SPEAKER_11]: and Cimarron, we're always there waiting
for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just come on through.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ample parking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_11]: For all your freshest buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: John John's a sweet dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll hook you up real good.
[SPEAKER_11]: He is the man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good timing, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on for showing up right as we
started the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was glorious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it wasn't a great timing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to stall to wait for you,
you know, but then that song happened and
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to just, you know, the song just
lured me in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to grow with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got called in by the song.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if I can put this guitar
away.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to keep that out.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to use that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since you're playing the guitar,
introduce yourself, dude, because I don't
[SPEAKER_11]: remember your name and I'm high.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys just merged out of the video
game room a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, oh shit, you got a real
podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: They came and joined the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: GG Fam is thick and thorough, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome to the crew.
[SPEAKER_11]: Introduce yourself to the show,
please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm Daniel and I'm glad to be here
on the show tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the one they call Flair.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Rick Flair?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that Flair?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I like that Flair.
[SPEAKER_11]: He like the nature boy, boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throwing figure fours on him, boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm over to smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: I barely smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens when you're in the trap house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you got to take it back to 16,
you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, we're going to get lit up.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Joints, blunts, dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Hunt wrote down a few topics.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to be the OCD guy in the group
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I could read your writing,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to hit my inhaler?
[SPEAKER_11]: Beat you all to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt was recently diagnosed with asthma.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that going for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't walk upstairs that fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more gloves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Temporary asthma with bronchitis right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm like off all the fucking pieces and
shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a hand wallet problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely part of the spinning Viper
club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your hand wall getting a little sandy
and rough?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wheezing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wheezing and coughing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the Nebraska will get you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, you were up in a helicopter jumping
out of a helicopter onto a 1,400 foot
[SPEAKER_11]: mountain on skis.
[SPEAKER_07]: 1,400?
[SPEAKER_07]: 1,400.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I might be high and not know how to
count zeros.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only 1,200 feet high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from Ohio, but I think it's higher
than that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was just in Silverton like two
weeks ago doing a bunch of heli drops and
[SPEAKER_11]: skiing 13,000 foot cliffs.
[SPEAKER_11]: With bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had acute bronchitis at that
point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, still jumping out of the heli and
getting down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Still taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever you did last week, you're a
pussy.
[SPEAKER_11]: My buddy Hunt was on top of a 14,000 foot
mountain jumping out of a helicopter on
skis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And fucking five feet of pow.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now he has asthma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't try this at home.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's hitting an inhaler.
[SPEAKER_11]: He does three or four dabs and goes to the
inhaler.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of cheating, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to live.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting ahead just like Schwarzenegger
did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I hit that, boy?
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to hit that shit?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me hit that now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got that Arbutin all OG player.
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as you feel good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it help you out?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, lace up another fucking hot kneel
for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Mark Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Mark Wahlberg is coming in
later, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Since you invited me here, I want to
definitely make sure to take some time to
[SPEAKER_11]: rep all your companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're with the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me, give you a couple seconds to hype
up the Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I own a company that's called
Grimy Gatsby, thegrimygatsby.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to check it out, it's a media
and lifestyle website.
[SPEAKER_11]: And since that's been started years ago,
there's now like a large portfolio of
[SPEAKER_11]: awesome people and brands that make up a
gigantic network all across the country.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have Green and Healthy Wellness down
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Dispensary, Apothecanna,
Cannabis, Topicals, and Lotions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Apothecanna, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the dudes in the room, the whole
Turbex squad, how I get down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my own moniker here called The
Gatherer with the Turbex crew because
[SPEAKER_11]: that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brought a party tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brought the homies in.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's what, 50, 60 people in the other
room?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's like 34 down here and the VIP is
sold out at 50.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all just up there packaging grams
is all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, there's like the Cannabis Grand
Crew is a big, you know, super high
[SPEAKER_11]: echelon, limited to 500 people in its
event that travels all over the country
[SPEAKER_11]: that I help produce.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Smokey Brand, which is Smokey
Socks and Smokey Clothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Custom sublimated socks and sublimated
clothing plus knitted stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we source stuff for, you know,
all kinds of unbelievable brands.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can get just about anything we want
printed on some socks, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything that you want on a sock and
anything you want on a shirt, pretty much
[SPEAKER_11]: anything that you want in concentrate
form, anything you want in topicals,
[SPEAKER_11]: anything you want on a shelf, anything you
need.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just now working on this 3D printing
company that's going to start up in Denver
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of like, you know,
whatever comes through and how we can do
[SPEAKER_11]: it to maximize the whole network.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make a personal request for
some Apothecanna.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a friend who she's got bad skin
and she would love a cannabis product or a
[SPEAKER_11]: more organic, healthy product to help her
clear up her blemishes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get Apothecanna on that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have it at the shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does rashes, irritations, cuts,
burns, blisters, any of that kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime you touch that nail, like a Wook
wood, you know, you get that burn on your
[SPEAKER_11]: finger, go stick that sucker in some
Apothecanna.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need a nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a, here's a rig for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to the mad Rob rig.
[SPEAKER_11]: You asked for a dab a minute ago and I
just shined you on because I was talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you were just like, you know,
keep eating your time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just keep talking, keep talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll give you a dab when I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're good, when you say something
worth it, I'll give you a dab like a
[SPEAKER_11]: reward.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a good dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I mean, it's, if you go to the
website, you know, follow us on Instagram
[SPEAKER_11]: at at Grammy Gatsby, but it's a,
it's just a gigantic network of people,
[SPEAKER_11]: much like Iry and Turpex and everything
else that we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, trying to be as
community-based and making sure people are
[SPEAKER_11]: getting forward and being positive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's tons of brands.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the guys that are in the room are
probably the most important ones.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause this is how we all make it happen.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That bread, that bread, that bread.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear there's just, can we talk about the
key?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody know about the key?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can talk about the key.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me about the key.
[SPEAKER_11]: In 2010, I started Grammy Gatsby in Aspen
and we only have about 2,500 locals in
[SPEAKER_11]: Aspen, something, maybe 3000 now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've left since then, but in Aspen,
it was this thing where like all these
[SPEAKER_11]: people always had parties and cool shit
happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for Grammy Gatsby, I wanted it to be
something special.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would throw a party every week
called Gatsby's garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out, you know, big up all the grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we would do Gatsby's garden every
Tuesday at a revolving bar and the people
[SPEAKER_11]: that were like truly homies and people
that like were respected, we would hook
[SPEAKER_11]: them up with the skull key.
[SPEAKER_11]: Open your parchment right by the mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right by the bike.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we know we had the skull key made that
we got like 3000 skull keys.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so a lot of the guys in the room all
have one of the skull key, but the thought
[SPEAKER_11]: was is that, you know, the skull key opens
up every single door in the Gatsby
[SPEAKER_11]: mansion, allows you to go to all the
parties.
[SPEAKER_11]: So initially it was started that the
bouncers in Aspen, if you show them the
[SPEAKER_11]: key, wouldn't check your ID or make you
stand in line.
[SPEAKER_11]: So our parties were, you know,
instantly a little bit more hoity toity
[SPEAKER_11]: for the locals because they could just
walk right in and shine off in front of
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since then, it's now evolved into,
you know, people all over the world have
[SPEAKER_11]: this little skull key on their key chain.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very nice connection point.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when we have events,
there's a lot of keys in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when the keys are out by themselves,
at least they know we're all together.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's dope.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's admirable.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a neat little thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I stumbled on it on accident.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does one earn a key?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, where's my key?
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I wasn't going to ask that,
but I'm glad they stepped up for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the keys now are only handed out
at the dojo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoes off, secret knock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoes off, secret knock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drum circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fam is fam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shoes off, secret knock.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dojo temps down, turps up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Drum circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turps down, temps up.
[SPEAKER_04]: All day.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was like marketing and
branding and this cool little thing that I
[SPEAKER_11]: could do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's, you know, I have,
I've broken one since then.
[SPEAKER_11]: And have people send them to me and all
kinds of just crazy bullshit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's cool to like, you know,
I think you have a key, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not have a key, but you'll get one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know where the dojo.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been to your new house,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: You moved and I haven't been there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't tell nobody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we live a hundred and something
miles apart.
[SPEAKER_11]: We meet up in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag white people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag no free time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, you guys, everybody in this room is a
social media monster.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of them, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everybody likes to sit down on
that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys, I feel like social media is
what brought my, my business, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: I did it on accident.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I'm going to start a little
seed company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I put her up on social media?
[SPEAKER_11]: Little seed company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Suddenly it was like, you've got one of
the known seed companies on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all social media.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys notice that from like being a
hash company?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys see that a lot?
[SPEAKER_11]: Instagram's a huge, huge platform.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many followers does Turbex have?
[SPEAKER_11]: 21,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's killing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more than me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've probably at 13,000 by the time this
airs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still close to there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been building that, uh, that number
for almost what, two or three years at
[SPEAKER_07]: this point, three years almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, definitely about three years.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the exact Turbex account so they
can find it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Turbexco, T E R P X E O.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there an underscore anywhere?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just at Turbexco.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys find them checking out,
check them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great hash pictures.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also make sure you follow green and
healthy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is their, uh, you guys changed that
Instagram or something, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we, um, we're at green and healthy
seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Haters gonna hate man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Haters gonna hate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Haters gonna ain't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got kicked off twice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hate us cause they're ain't us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we actually, yeah, we had three
accounts deleted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're up to like, you know,
1500 and how'd you get your accounts
[SPEAKER_11]: deleted?
[SPEAKER_11]: What'd you do?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Instagram's all about that non-life
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We try to get down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't do it to me, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been posting, I just got a new camera
and my picture, my game has increased.
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't squish me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of haters, dude, you wanted,
uh, you reminded me, you asked me when I
[SPEAKER_11]: got here, why they made me change the
name.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I'll tell you again, cause a lot of
people are new to the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it used to be, I grow cult,
I grow, I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I grow like based on the iPhone and the
iMac and the iCult it all is, was I grow
[SPEAKER_11]: culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause you listen on your iPhone,
but there's an education entity that does
[SPEAKER_11]: agricultural educational seminars or some
kind of shit for colleges.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he goes for the inhaler.
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole room looked at me like,
say something about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say something about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You all heard it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's recorded.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that that Albuterol?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that Albuterol OG player.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's getting all fucked up over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't want me relating cannabis to
their organization.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they kindly were like, please don't,
you know, I didn't want to steal someone
[SPEAKER_11]: else's name and we're all grown from our
heart here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dig up some respect for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're gonna do what you gotta
do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to, if that's their name,
I don't want to steal it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to steal it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will take me in.
Thanks.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That new logo is fucking crisp with the
readouts and the I, you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out to a website called Fiverr,
F-I-V-E-R-R.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some young kid in Bangladesh made the
avatar of me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another guy in Bangladesh pieced
the two together and made me the logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 bucks for everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like all those callers that you get
to marketing and whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably does tech support by day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was about to say, I was about to look at
you and be like, are you going to throw
[SPEAKER_11]: out a Bangladesh accent?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to, but it was just going to
sound like an Indian.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's racist.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we already got racist just by,
just by talking about the cheap labor
[SPEAKER_11]: wages.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just run a labor camp and we're talking
about social media.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how many, how many social media is the
Grammy Gatsby have around?
[SPEAKER_11]: Not media followers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're probably like 3,500 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we run about 10 different accounts for
other people as well that are probably way
[SPEAKER_11]: larger than we are.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I mean, you want to look at
like, it's just like having a website or
[SPEAKER_11]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you got to have, you know,
content is king as they say, and it's
[SPEAKER_11]: quality and consistency.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to have the right branding.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to have your shit together.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not trying to put up pictures of
brick walls or other kinds of,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, stuff like that are all kinds of
weird things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you really want to have it together
so that it actually looks like what the
[SPEAKER_11]: brand needs to be like.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that way you can expose it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, you know, I will tell you the ones
that I've learned over the years doing it
[SPEAKER_11]: often is that your audience needs to be
able to watch your story.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like how you said, you know, you blew up
on Instagram or how these guys have gone
[SPEAKER_11]: from, you know, Santa Cruz to Colorado and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to be a part of that experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew of Turbex before they ever had a
Colorado presence because of their cup
[SPEAKER_11]: winnings and Instagram stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out Turbex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who?
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who?
[SPEAKER_11]: Turbex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of Turbex, somebody just passed a
rig to me and I've got a big chunk of Kim
[SPEAKER_11]: dog here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: What other topics did I open?
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought, I got all choked up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought a bottle of Dr. Pepper into the
room and hunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's doing it again.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like collapsing with, with wilt.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, bro?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's with the Dr. Pepper?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something I will let some of the
other guys in the room talk about first,
[SPEAKER_11]: but there's, I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't do a lot of things, but there's
one thing about 23 flavors that makes me
[SPEAKER_11]: get a chubby.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm saying, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first, when I first moved out here
and met hunt, this guy pretty much,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, most every time I saw him,
he had a Dr. Pepper in one of his hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, yeah, you know, he had to start
getting all healthy and everything like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's eating kale salads.
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually got me on it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we, we, we put the Dr.
Pepper's away for awhile, so it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: hard for him to sit here at this table and
watch you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jelly beans, lip balm, fucking drinks.
[SPEAKER_11]: They make all kinds of stuff with the 23
flavor Turbex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who saw that shot?
[SPEAKER_11]: Did anybody see that perfection?
[SPEAKER_11]: Left-handed bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lefty shot right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can just smell it and be happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long has it been?
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably like a week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's all.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've cheated, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only had like two Dr. Pepper's since
we gave them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not know.
Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, they had that fucking luxury
Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, the last one I had was at the
fucking WWE Smackdown with Johnny Randall
[SPEAKER_11]: Jr. over here, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you though, if you go to Sonic
and get that cubed crushed ice shit and
[SPEAKER_11]: you get some Dr. Pepper in there,
that ice is special, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_11]: That ice is something great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of our partners is hooked on
Sonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooked on Sonic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag fueled by Sonic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fueled by Sonic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fueled by John.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fueled by street tacos.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but that 23 flavor things is like a
nice easy topic to get into though because
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, get your nail all fired up because
we got to talk about Turbs anyways.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the next topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to talk about Apothecanna and the
Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to give these guys some time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear just in random conversation that
there are several badass new products
[SPEAKER_11]: coming out in the future through the
Turbex line.
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of them got my attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I asked this while Jordan's
taking a mean dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll pass that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, cough out some answers here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we've been doing some experimenting
lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely got some cool new things that
we're going to be bringing out here pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have some electronic
cigarettes that are going to be coming out
[SPEAKER_07]: pre-filled and not the standard PG or VG
or whatever the fuck people are cutting
[SPEAKER_07]: their oil with whatever you want to call
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to tell us what you're going
to use?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a couple of different
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely going to be some just
regular BHO pens that are available.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all going to be stuff from the garden
that we have connected to our processing
[SPEAKER_07]: center.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll all be stuff that we're cultivating
specifically for its end purpose of being
[SPEAKER_07]: a delicious electronic cigarette product.
[SPEAKER_11]: Being grown for extract instead of just
being somebody's rejected material.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only that, we've got some edibles that
are going to start coming out here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a couple of people working on
them pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some things I will even say we
cannot say on air about the edibles coming
[SPEAKER_11]: out because there's shit about to hit the
fan one day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't let him talk about all those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another big thing is that we're going to
be going rec soon too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the biggest things that
we've been working on lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turpax is not available recreationally?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, as of right now, our processing center
is in Colorado Springs, which obviously as
[SPEAKER_07]: you know is banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any recreational businesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to get you guys down at the spot
in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be a great addition to that.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping by April 1st to be processing
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to be running your gear too up
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be so nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see that iRegenetic collabo
turpax get down, globby slobby,
[SPEAKER_11]: keep it gangster.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you guys actually have some of my
genetics in the garden day turpax.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just trying to throw out hashtags.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your goal is to just say as many hashtags
on the show as you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I am the soundbite gatherer.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are you guys trying to talk about?
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep it too heavy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep it too light.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get in the mic all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag advertising.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag turp team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag bring the stash back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I just got called out on my beard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you missed the Flanders mustache.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your badge picture is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't take you seriously Alec Baldwin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I literally have.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweaty balls.
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely have.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a straight handlebar curled
mustache up in that one that I grew for
[SPEAKER_11]: months to try to get it ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the best story about that one,
I told the boys, but when I got my picture
[SPEAKER_11]: taken at the MED, the little lady that
works the computer literally looked at me
[SPEAKER_11]: and she was like, how long?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like a couple months.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was like, can I touch it?
[SPEAKER_04]: She reached over and combed my womb room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like a man's wreck softball
coach.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to let it fly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wasn't going to touch it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those things are better if you just let
them pass.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we hyped up Turpax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned a bunch of products.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your favorite one that you're most
excited about that you want to hype up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this mean give me a dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what that sign language is?
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought Hunt was giving me sign language
to say which one of these things he was
[SPEAKER_07]: most excited about.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll throw you off.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to wipe your fingers off after you
do that, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even want to touch you now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a dab over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got them.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have everybody in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say we're pretty excited about the
edibles coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that we've been working
on for a while, but we just didn't want
[SPEAKER_07]: to...
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly some turp drying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't want to hit the market before we
really had everything figured out,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially with how restrictive everything
is out here with the rules for making
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rules keep changing every week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody's trying to shoot ropes like Peter
North on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hit edibles pretty hard with that
milligram thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I win.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I want to dab on that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely sign into the whole room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's it at?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The edibles are going to be on point once
we can actually say there's going to... I
[SPEAKER_11]: will say I'll go a little bit more in
depth on some things.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be like... My troll hand
is fucking big.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me on comments because I'll get
going.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but we're going to have some great
edibles coming through at the shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, with all the new products they
have coming to you, you have an
[SPEAKER_11]: unbelievable way to get a comprehensive
medication on.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can ingest, you can smoke,
you can have something for the go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially with us being able to
cultivate strains specifically for
[SPEAKER_07]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hunting through some new CBD strains
here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already got a couple, but we've got
some that are going to be truly,
[SPEAKER_11]: truly unique terpium profiles on a lot of
shit that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: I threw down something I think should be
high in CBD if it comes through for you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where Boracross should be high in
CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: The uglier plants will be higher in CBD is
what I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have more of that bamboo hemp rope.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, people that are at home growing
hemp rope, calling it cannabis,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's okay too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mids, mids.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terpex edibles.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long until you think I can have some
Terpex edibles?
[SPEAKER_11]: And is it going to be like chocolatey
stuff?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we tell them about grandma?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we tell them about grandma?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't spill any beans.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to... This is a show.
[SPEAKER_11]: My job's to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't wear your headphones and take a
dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say like... You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just fucking with you because it was
weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like turning down the radio so you
can see better.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a few things that we're making
this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sending everything to get lab tested
before it actually hits the shelf because
[SPEAKER_07]: we don't want any issues.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to just use 500 milligrams
on accident?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Watch me do a merino doubt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I can handle that, but most people
cannot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys can take the 1200 milligram
challenge in a day, we'd love to hang out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Explain the 1200 milligram challenge to
me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of like No Mount Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we get a little bit of guitar behind
the background?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to go with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The 1200 milligram challenge is much like
No Mount Nebraska in a sense where the
[SPEAKER_11]: name kind of gives it away, but there's a
lot more in depth about your passion for
[SPEAKER_11]: the actual event.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to start off probably with maybe
400 to 800 milligrams and slowly work your
[SPEAKER_11]: way up to 12.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then at that point, you go outside and
put your hands up in the air and scream up
[SPEAKER_11]: to John, thank you, and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically like any other mental or
physical challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that you need to work
yourself up to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just jump in at 1200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a couple of days at 2500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I get a sponsor?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I get a sponsor for this?
[SPEAKER_11]: I need someone to throw down... I need
1200.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I need 800.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now we're at 2000.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I need 600.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to step yourself up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to do like a 300.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I can do... I've done 350.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've eaten a 350 milligram.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you that the way that I have
found best to imbibe the 1200 milligrams
[SPEAKER_11]: is straight capsules.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you open the capsules up and take them
while they're half open.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you just pretty much,
you just jump right in like a land's
[SPEAKER_07]: carpet.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, the last time we were preparing for
the milligram challenge, the 1200
[SPEAKER_07]: milligram challenge, I was actually pretty
disappointed because I was talking hell of
[SPEAKER_07]: shit on everybody because I had been
training really hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was waking up every day and just
slamming a thousand, eating a thousand
[SPEAKER_07]: milligrams for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Then having another couple hundred for
lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time that happened, everybody else
had been eating so many capsules too,
[SPEAKER_07]: training for the challenge that it was
just like, shit wasn't going well business
[SPEAKER_07]: wise for anybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: You definitely have a very relaxed state
of mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one homie in Washington who was going
to be doing it with us, he broke like two
[SPEAKER_07]: mothership minis in a week or some shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the exact story was that he
knocked over his mothership mini bubbler
[SPEAKER_11]: while he was trying to go to sleep and
also had like a tornado of money blowing
[SPEAKER_11]: around on his patio or some shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying is
it's not like you want to go straight to
[SPEAKER_11]: the black diamonds at the mountain and
throw yourself down.
[SPEAKER_11]: 1200 is serious.
[SPEAKER_11]: 1200 is no joke at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted to make sure we were over a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you really want to get intense,
you try to hit 2500.
[SPEAKER_11]: That just sounds through them again.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's like, that's like the gram dab
of edibles is what we're doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also it's like, if you, if you don't
smoke, those are obviously good ways to do
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're really trying to get,
you know, some sort of sedation for me,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was just the fact that like,
I don't have anxiety and I'm extremely
[SPEAKER_11]: focused.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's be real, if you're trying to
like never get sick, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: As we know, cannabis can cure everything
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you eat that shit, you're going to
be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the other thought, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like, we figured if we could do like
1200 milligrams for a month, there was no
[SPEAKER_11]: way that we would ever have any pathogens,
cancers, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no way they even get into us
because we're just super saturated in our
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoid system and our lymph nodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I need a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody throw down like 2500 pills or
2500 milligrams of pills.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take care of you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Between all parties in the room,
I'm sure we've got, we'll get this.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are not liable for what happens after
you hit 200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as none of them are real high CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have I told you guys about my CBD
adventures?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you listened to the episode with CBD?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are all extract artists.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys call yourselves now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is extract artists the term anymore?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a word to use?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone goes silent.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember extract artists.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like that term.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not crazy about that term.
[SPEAKER_11]: We started doing this shit because we love
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are going to love this.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the appropriate group.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've noticed if I smoke too much CBD,
I can't bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You go full drunk with a dick?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, no, it works.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, it's still fucking,
yeah, it just won't, there's no end.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's birth control.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a fucking man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not been smoking enough CBD,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you just not too fast?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he just gets it done.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't smoked enough CBDs to really
perform that kind of research on myself,
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a chick friend who was actually
going to go smoke a bunch of CBDs and beat
[SPEAKER_11]: his dick.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of how it happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went to the dispensary and bought a
bunch of CBD medicine and we smoked out
[SPEAKER_11]: and we went to the house and tried to
fucking shag and there was no,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're both like, yeah, but like an hour of
just sweating on each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at her, I was like, I don't
think, she's like, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just two wooks walking around in her room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wooking it up, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nice little wook out for the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think that smells?
[SPEAKER_11]: About as good as his story about shitting
in his buddy's VW bus.
[SPEAKER_11]: That did happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't get into that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another podcast for that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had never found that with CBDs,
but I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I think it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't tend to lean towards the CBDs as
much as I'm looking for THCV and THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'll tell you what, I'm going to
try it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go jerk off, see how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait 24 hours, smoke a bunch of CBD herb,
go try to whack one out and see if it's
[SPEAKER_11]: just like three quarters of the way there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what ratio is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this might be something
patentable.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually the Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like 21% CBD or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_11]: 21 to one?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring in the opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: GW Pharma is patenting a 21 to one.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: G Pharma was like, Oh, what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's patent that.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it'll ever come again.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder what happens if you hit like an
80 to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if you just like turn into like
titanium Superman.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was talking to a nurse and she said,
I think she's a paramedic or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she said that there is an electrical
response in your brain that causes a
[SPEAKER_11]: seizure.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that same electrical response in your
brain is responsible for your orgasm.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like an electrical firing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you smoke CBD, it turns that off.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you don't have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they code that, that receptor.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're coding your, your fricking cum
receptor too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're literally muting your cum receptor.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just putting like a cover over it
so that it just can't.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like getting in an elevator with no
13th floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The government's going to get a hold of
that and use it for fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: overpopulation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's just something I discovered
that we'd share.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's say if you do the 12- I know
they grow a lot of hemp in China and they
[SPEAKER_07]: use that shit and it ain't working over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give John John a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying CBDs will actually make
you last longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much longer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't, I couldn't come at all to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to smoke more CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people need to be getting on them
CBDs then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a minute man, then get up on the
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get up on the fucking CBDizzles.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all been under the minute before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's been times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one's always easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about getting back up after you fall
every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take a Viagra, you know, you'll be
good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I will tell you, if you do the
1200 milligram challenge, you'll probably
[SPEAKER_11]: have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've noticed that for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I'll be able to pay
attention long enough to even care.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tug, tug, tug.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play Xbox.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're getting old and you get
bored jerking off.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is stupid.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one was easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've gotten way off course here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: 420 is coming up and I've been told that
there is a cannabis cup booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there is some things in the work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously we talked earlier about all the
different brands, but- Lots of brands.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smokey brand, one of the big badass
clothing companies that I have worked
[SPEAKER_11]: with.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've decided to kind of do this road
show every year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll be, you know, manning up and
running their production for the Denver
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis cup coming up, Seattle,
San Fran, LA.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll be doing, what is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Agenda and Magic, AEG, big gallery.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be doing like varieties of like
high-end fashion all the way down to
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis cups, to glass shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this cannabis cup in Denver,
we will have a Smokey brand booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be a really large island.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's probably like four or five
brands that I'm not able to say yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be appearances from the Turpex
Boys and Apothecanna and Irie Genetics and
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, it's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think, I don't think there's
going to be a, there's not going to be a
[SPEAKER_11]: big thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys will be appearing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It won't be your booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if we're going to do a booth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The MED unfortunately is, we're waiting
for some rules to come out about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the, all the brands that will be in
our booth at Smokey brands that won't be
[SPEAKER_11]: licensed cannabis brands.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have all kinds of clothing brands
and glass brands and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_11]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: No product, no smokeable consumable
cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will be, they will have their own
smokeable consumable product.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can't as an MED licensed business.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe you're going to be able to
have anything going on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think High Times just canceled the
medical side of it too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure it was still going to be
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's definitely a bunch of different
rumors going around.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm saying it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's a bunch of brands that I
will say once they announced, but it won't
[SPEAKER_11]: be any of like the staple cannabis brands
that we have in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be more of the, you know,
fashion, glass, vape pens, probably
[SPEAKER_11]: different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be at the booth, but you know,
all of the homies and the GG fam will be
[SPEAKER_11]: there dabbing out and having a great time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the people in the room right now,
while we getting down, um, along with the,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, some suicide girls and some
other people like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey now, suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag suicide girls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look who's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just keep strolling in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to more Turbex crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out, shout out, shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be at the, uh, the cannabis cup
booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be at the cup roaming around.
[SPEAKER_11]: So find me guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be at the, uh, the booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your booth called?
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it's going to be the smoky brand
booth.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have our location yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't come out with the map,
but as soon as you get there, if you want
[SPEAKER_11]: to grab.
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be smoky socks all over.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got a big pot leaf as a logo.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a smoky socks.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a bunch of clothes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a bunch of, um, all kinds of
shit set up.
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be, obviously there'll be a VIP
inside GG fam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shoes off secret knock time party.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Ross and Jeff will be up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably won't have any seeds because
honestly I'm going to a, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_11]: sound like a dick.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a private party Friday night
between a bunch of seed breeders and
[SPEAKER_11]: traders and a bunch of invite onlys.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my seeds will probably be eaten up
then.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only seeds he'll be giving away are
the ones he's picking up for me on Friday
[SPEAKER_11]: night.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean you've got a surplus of Irish
seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: There might be a couple of packs in my
backpack when I start.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, uh, there might be a couple in
there right now, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_11]: We definitely, the dub wise, the black
cherry cam.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, are we supposed to say the other
ones that aren't?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can talk about, yeah, if I've
given you anything, you can talk about
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one that's the mouthful.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in a new state, if you're in
whatever you're trying to do, if you can
[SPEAKER_11]: find the way to get some beans,
our genetics is probably a company that
[SPEAKER_11]: you should have in your garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I work hard to keep stuff going.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually working on the black cherry
cam F2 right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually harvesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did the female hunt to find the female
that I want to breed with.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm harvesting them now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I chose the right bitch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a purple one.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need any, if you need anybody else
to, uh, help you, uh, make selections.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that, you know, one of the
biggest ones that we all talk about is the
[SPEAKER_11]: lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause that's the, you know, the one
hitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are arguments.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've crossed the lemon Jeffrey to the
grateful dog and there are arguments over
[SPEAKER_11]: what the name is going to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give John John a mic for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, King Joffrey game of Thrones.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what my buddy said that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody else told me that I didn't get
the reference there.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a real dickhead king.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag spoilers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended up poisoning him out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spoilers.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Controversy on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lemon is so prevalent.
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you were saying, we got to taste it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love a taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'll let you taste it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's upside down.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to get that final trim a couple
of days in a jar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now it's looking like that seventies
bush.
[SPEAKER_11]: God, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to make some full milk or some
Nebraska?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, uh, I don't fuck around and it's
going to make some, uh, turpex shatter or
[SPEAKER_11]: some live res.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I flux with.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not, if I, I can make my own hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have my own vac oven.
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily I've got friends that let me use
their vac.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can make some decent hash, but,
uh, garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out boys.
[SPEAKER_11]: They live five minutes away from me.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my homies.
[SPEAKER_11]: They make most of my hash for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And since, uh, nobody's had a harvest for
a minute and we are hash heads and we
[SPEAKER_11]: smoked all our hash, it's been turpex is
my second reliable source.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we send a lot of people up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to work out some sort of affiliate
program.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to start getting some credit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to figure out a hashtag for them
to use when they come in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fueled by John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fueled by John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to get that rec stuff going for your
spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get them down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: True.
[SPEAKER_11]: True.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've, I sit on another show.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys are in Denver or if you're in
Pueblo drive to Springs and go get this
[SPEAKER_11]: hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's worth the 45 minute drive.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do it every week.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm up here once a week, usually on a
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to start coming on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it's donut day, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a, we do Dilla donuts every Friday
morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dilla made us do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We play hip hop all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Amy's donuts in the lobby for all
the people that come through while they
[SPEAKER_11]: last.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they go quickly?
[SPEAKER_11]: I got there early and they went out last
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have waited to deliver that new
drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I delivered a new drop of flavors over
there at close tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have came right when they opened
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could have got first pick of them
dead donuts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Amy, yeah, big up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Amy's donuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amy's donuts is fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: They keep us laced up with everything from
that elf.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of this with banana chips on it to the
blueberry icing with the rainbow stripe.
[SPEAKER_11]: All kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got a cookie butter one.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got a cookie butter donut.
[SPEAKER_11]: Half cookie butter, half chocolate.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have cotton candies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're on that healthy tip,
but you'll eat the donuts.
[SPEAKER_11]: John John is my proof here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only had one donut this whole month.
[SPEAKER_11]: One donut.
[SPEAKER_11]: On that healthy shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're looking good, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're getting all swole.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I still got bronchitis and inhaling.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually eat about two of them though,
so you better get that going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag sad face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag fatty.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you, we, as a staff,
we get in there early on Friday morning
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's Dilla Donuts, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You put on some J Dilla and you let
Quasimodo and Doom play.
[SPEAKER_11]: Throw the music up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wolfing down some sugar at eight o'clock
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, things get productive.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are doing cartwheels when I get
in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slam a red bull, get after it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop in the shop, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cool place.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to like three dispensaries on the
planet and this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate all the love.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you, you guys down there in Pueblo
and especially like, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that is the thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause that boy be on that Shula.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got that Shula boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That Shula that good.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have some good.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're waiting for, we're waiting for our
masterfully grown crop to come in and
[SPEAKER_11]: that'll be, you know, and then probably
like two months.
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now we have great flowers and
everything on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an unbelievable concentrate
selection.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes we're up to like 24 different
flavors of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're at like 13.
[SPEAKER_11]: That Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_11]: I shouldn't even see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That Chuck Norris is gone, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have the Gary Busey OG on the shelf
right now though.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the one that I want to know about
this name?
[SPEAKER_11]: Drake's hankership.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should probably put the nature boy Ric
Flair on the mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause that's his name that he came up
with.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hear about this nature boy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually knows what's up with the
turkeys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get up on the top rope and tell me about
this shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead silence.
[SPEAKER_11]: You put them on the spot and fucked him
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually based on the video game
Uncharted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, cause he's Drake is an adventurer
and he has a handkerchief and the real
[SPEAKER_08]: story.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it out of them though.
[SPEAKER_08]: That got it out of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was some fucking, it was some flow and
some blue dream cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we thought, you know, people are
going to cry when they fucking hit this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we just said, fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who's, who's like cries a lot and
we're like, Drake fucking was playing
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe on Pandora or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not playing on Pandora.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only concentrate we will ever
see that has the word handkerchief in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the name Drake, I hope.
[SPEAKER_11]: You pretty much said what I said when I
saw the drop, but I was like, wow,
[SPEAKER_11]: really now we got to explain what genetics
Drake handkerchief is to everybody that
[SPEAKER_11]: comes in.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the story.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a hashtag, fuck blue dream and
flow and flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys out there with that
fucking DJ shortcut and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_07]: bullshit, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And talk about that blue dream shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about that for a second,
because since moving to fucking Colorado,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen more flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or shit that smells or tastes exactly like
fucking flow than I've seen ever in my
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking life.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is up with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the bomb shit out here?
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't, they don't like Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't like where's the Kush.
[SPEAKER_11]: The dogs trying to go outside.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I mean, I think a lot of it is
the fact that like that blue dream just
[SPEAKER_11]: blows up like a balloon for people that
don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The flow is super easy to grow here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It grows outdoors.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're a mediocre grower and you
need to pull some weight, blue dream is
[SPEAKER_11]: for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've never grown weed before and
you're about, I think the flow,
[SPEAKER_11]: the flow that goes around here actually
came from DJ short gave that cut to Ed
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosenthal who passed it around to a few
people out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my friend Tom had a dispensary here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a dispensary in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he spread that out through his
dispensaries a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also went through other sources.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying he put it all over,
but that cut, I actually think is DJ's
[SPEAKER_11]: floetica and not flow.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think back in the 1940s, when they were
at it, somebody heard this back in the
[SPEAKER_11]: day, they should have done that to blue
dream.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue dream should never exist.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I crossed the blue dream to the
grateful dog and I call it the blue healer
[SPEAKER_11]: and it fixed blue dream.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it?
[SPEAKER_11]: It made the, made much larger grateful dog
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it comes out a lot like grateful dog,
just better harvests.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can polish a turd.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now the part that sucks is I have to
keep a mother plant of blue dream in the
[SPEAKER_11]: garden all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So actually we should get off a blue dream
and get onto some other strains that are
[SPEAKER_07]: probably better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that we all dislike certain
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got that's coming down the
pipeline?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been working on this F2 of black
cherry chem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you see that I'm going to say a
name that I've never said on the show,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I think if I say it, then nobody could
steal it from me because it'll be out
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to hit a dead head OG plant with
black cherry chem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to find a name for that lemon
Jeffrey grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on, I want to work for,
I'm looking for an Arise male plant right
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to start using the Arise as my
breeding staple.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be my next boy that goes for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be like my new stud for the next
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the terms like on that guy?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a golden goat crossed a daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's sweet Kush.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_11]: The daybreakers a great plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the, anything you put to the golden
goat makes resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it just resin comes out of that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that male will make everything
resiny and stanky.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to talk about something real
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the new thing going on all along
the social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about this rosin text.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag space bomb.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not tried it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually I have an interview we're ahead
of ourselves in recording, but I've
[SPEAKER_11]: recorded an episode that I've left a blank
spot to throw in an interview with soil
[SPEAKER_11]: grown so that I can learn a bit about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully in the last episode that got
tossed in there, but the interview is
[SPEAKER_11]: supposed to happen tomorrow when I get
home.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is awkward.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're traveling in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what CBD can do also.
[SPEAKER_11]: So hold on with the rosin tech,
that shit's been around since like the
[SPEAKER_11]: fucking sixties in the seventies,
just like a lot of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not necessarily going to,
you know, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know what it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: You take your weed and you put it in a
piece of parchment paper and fold it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take the weed, you take the fucking
nugget.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you hit it with a... You either
hair press it or people are using a
[SPEAKER_11]: t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the sixties and seventies,
that's what would happen back in the day
[SPEAKER_11]: is they would take that shitty weed and
t-shirt press it and be able to extract
[SPEAKER_11]: something they wouldn't call bubble hash
that would sell for more.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that from my time being a
cultivator in Tijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a story for a different day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Completely solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's no solvent in there,
not even water.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of a mini tech.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's activating and expressing it as it's
heating it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you are still losing some potency if it
gets hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find a hair straightener, I'd try it right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you activating it though?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is becoming decarbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, when you're heating it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're using like a hundred
degrees or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a hundred and six is where
decarbing starts right around there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I have nothing against it,
but it doesn't really do much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it does.
[SPEAKER_11]: It melts and it gets high and all that
stuff, but it's not the same terpene
[SPEAKER_11]: profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a marijuana R&D specialist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should try it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to see some locals do it so that
I could take a dab of it and talk about it
[SPEAKER_11]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well then there you have it obviously now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody go to the beauty supply store and
pick up a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at Walgreens today and I saw like a
whole fucking aisle of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be gone in the next
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_11]: You took a couple of seconds and looked at
them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember when Bed Bath & Beyond put the
dab torches, the little no stick mats and
[SPEAKER_11]: turkey basters all in the same area and
Pyrex dishes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all in one little, they're like dab
guys, here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a computer program.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know what people buy at the same time
and then they put it together.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to buy a controller,
a game and a headset.
[SPEAKER_07]: They say it seems like people are buying a
lot of torches and turkey bastes at the
[SPEAKER_07]: same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should put them together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm allowed to say that because I've got
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are Jordan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested to see what happens next as
opposed to like going back into like the
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosenthalx and all the other shit and the
CO2 and all the ice water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a call from a friend today.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is working on some sort of large scale
version of a hair straightener t-shirt
[SPEAKER_07]: press situation because he's like,
dude, the shit's dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is it, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been the big thing lately on the
social media.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all people want to talk about and his
page has blown up.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got mad followers, mad, mad
followers.
[SPEAKER_11]: In this episode, I just randomly thought
about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I took a note in my head.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday to Rob the dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: This episode drops right before your
birthday or yeah, like right around your
[SPEAKER_11]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Rob.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you're listening to this episode,
but I know you don't get a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're out there at the bowling alley
playing with your balls.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday to Rob the dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get back to the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been way too much fun this
evening.
[SPEAKER_11]: We took some show notes and Hunt wrote
down the phrase, getting globby and put
[SPEAKER_11]: little marks by it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or no, slabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's congregate and get slabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pass you the rig so you can
get slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously it worked.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it work?
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it work?
[SPEAKER_11]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually kind of tell that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I met Mr. Hunt was at a
cannabis cup in Denver and he came up to
[SPEAKER_04]: me and my partner Shane and he's like,
what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I think we should congregate
and get slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: People all over the world are going to
say, let's congregate and get slabby.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually kind of turned into a joke at
the processing facility too, because we
[SPEAKER_07]: run stuff for 70 different centers or so,
and sometimes we get some shit that just
[SPEAKER_07]: yields terribly.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy, whenever we run like a thousand
gram column and there's just basically,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's virtually nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking homeboy yell out from the back,
we are getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like, when all the Hooters
chicks come up and sing happy birthday to
[SPEAKER_11]: you and all the same stuff, you got to
have the same shit going now.
[SPEAKER_11]: A long time ago I went to guitar center
and I bought a piece of equipment called a
[SPEAKER_11]: compressor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never been happier that I bought that
because you did not blow out the rest of
[SPEAKER_11]: my equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not know that that was even
something that I had to be worried about.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: This compressor just paid for its damn
self.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, compressor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got one upstairs.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't let that, all that
microphone get to all of here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's limited.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just compressed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're getting slabby, you do want to
get it up on like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slab time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're taking slabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sports fans.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can go steady globbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Slab fans.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right before the show gets off the rails,
I'm going to do two commercials because I
[SPEAKER_11]: actually promise everyone I'll do these
ads really quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: This podcast is brought to you by Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies.

[SPEAKER_11]: Go to Hygro, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to Hygro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, we were talking about these guys
earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_11]: The organic portions of this episode were
brought to you by my good friends at the
[SPEAKER_11]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Alan and Jay and Sean and
everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings,
African Nightcrawlers, Red Wigglers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, let's hear some dirty jokes.
[SPEAKER_11]: All your organic soil amendments,
go there, go there, go there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can check them out at
RockyMountainWormCompany.com or 411
[SPEAKER_11]: Dijuana Street in Colorado Springs,

[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you tell those guys you heard
them, heard about them through the
[SPEAKER_11]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to be on point with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: On point.
[SPEAKER_11]: To Alan and the boys, we were talking
about you all before the show too because
[SPEAKER_11]: I was saying that's some impressive shit
that you guys got going over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally good shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good shit over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're JT and the boys.
[SPEAKER_11]: JT and the boys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what that means.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lookout boys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got lost there, but I'm just going to be
a blonde about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a dab on the dabber here.
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys get slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went over all your notes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready to let it get a little bit
looser.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I read the commercials.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys have been sitting over here
like little kids behaving themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got two, four, five grown men in the
room plus a guy that snuck away because
[SPEAKER_11]: he's too shy for the podcast and a guitar.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can play some guitar, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get the guitar back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's probably, maybe it's time for
another song.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long will I take a dab?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk for another few seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take a dab with you and then
we'll break into song.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll break into song.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys can take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like Joey P, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is probably time to give a
little shout out to Dr. Pepper for all the
[SPEAKER_11]: sponsoring that they do for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they didn't pay shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to pay for this bottle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't shout that out at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't ever talk about Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, until they're paying, they'll get a
shout out on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: But obviously we need to give a little bit
of a talk about the sticktutiveness and
[SPEAKER_11]: wherewithal of everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because sometimes out there we're noticing
that some of you wooks are slacking,
[SPEAKER_11]: slipping on your pimping as they say.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to keep your pimp hands strong.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go like this on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: No ashy pimp hands, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to bring an ashy pimp hand
for the low down, low ball price,
[SPEAKER_11]: you better make sure that bitch is frosty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever the fuck that means.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I say after time hunts saying
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever the fuck that means, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a long episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just fucking hang in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to touch on this wook chic
stuff that I've been seeing around.
[SPEAKER_11]: All these dudes with 35 hatpins,
homeboys that don't have no girls but
[SPEAKER_11]: drive a rental car and have slabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, you got seven
motherships and a coil rig, but you got 82
[SPEAKER_11]: hottest.
[SPEAKER_11]: They get sloppy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You still up in mama's basement asking for
bacon every morning, but you got like 35
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking rigs in the basement that you kick
it on and you get on the forums and get
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking mad pendies with fucking opals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll get down with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to harsh anybody's mellow.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the west coast or the east coast or any
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to get down on the
motherfucking pendie rigs and you want to
[SPEAKER_11]: wear all that crap, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying that when you become a
grown ass man and you want to get grown
[SPEAKER_11]: ass man pussy, you got to put that shit in
a box and move it to the left like
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyonce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, whatever the fuck that means.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're dabbing too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out Joey P. If you haven't heard of
him, look him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag man pussy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are getting down.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing like the whole wedding,
cross your arms together and take each
[SPEAKER_11]: other's fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting sloppy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's illegal at Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been one of my favorite episodes
to record and I hate to say that to all my
[SPEAKER_11]: homies back at home that record with me,
but you guys brought something to the
[SPEAKER_11]: table that hasn't been brought to the
table for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a weird thing in this
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually sitting next to my business
partner and my father.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit just got weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking around the room and there's
nobody here old enough to be your father.
[SPEAKER_11]: So unless there's an urn in the room,
that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about Jordan.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's my father.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's your father?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been nicknamed dad, you know,
by pretty much everybody in the group.
[SPEAKER_11]: So are you like the, are you the turpax
king basically or the king of the turpax
castle?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wouldn't say the king, but I would
say the, you know, fatherly figure,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: The godfather.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's little Anthony junior junior
from Brooklyn that comes in every now and
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, more like, you know,
the guy who you call when you,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, your battery's dead and you need
your car jumped in Fountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the good son.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the good son.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but you're the good son, but I've also
had to sit there and have discussions
[SPEAKER_07]: about birth control.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy shouted out from the other
fucking room, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like the Brian Epstein of turpax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag Beatles reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the manager of the Beatles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once he died, they all fell apart
and blamed it on Yoko.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the dude in the other room want to be
on the show at all?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's getting down on some turps over
there, but I would say, I mean,
[SPEAKER_11]: hopefully, I mean, I was trying to put
together a star studded cast for this so
[SPEAKER_11]: we could get a repeat performance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you guys will be back bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: We made it dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to hunt for helping me carry my
gear because this shoe is too heavy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't get it out of the car by
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime you need production or you need me
to line up some talent, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just give me a call.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of talent you got, bro?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do you need?
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever you can bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out a name and I'll try to make it
gather.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get them all here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't call them the gatherer for
nothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get, we need to get Addy back
on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was on episode number two and I sucked
at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll be in town for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to the guy that doesn't want to
come in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's still getting some laughs.
[SPEAKER_11]: He told me one time, he's like,
no, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I could tell he was like,
no, I want to be in the back growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's about 17 dabs in relaxing after being
under lights all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out, he deserves the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bro, we're going to get serious for half a
second.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were talking today at the shop about
being under high intensity discharge
[SPEAKER_11]: lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, for sure.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hunt taught me something I never thought
about guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cover your skin up in the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in your own personal grow,
you're probably all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're in like a room with like 20
or 30 or 40 or like I work with,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's 120 lights in some of the places.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cover your skin up, cover the top of your
head, wear some glasses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are getting melanoma.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are seeing weird shit on their
heads or getting like signs of sunburn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Their hair is falling out and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to go blind in there,
get some good glasses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even think of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I only think about the glasses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cover up your skin, cover your hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's definitely, you got to think
about exposure.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about sunscreen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that work?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's... Maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a dermatologist or a sunscreen
producer, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or a scientist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys aren't scientists.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just went on the internet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's definitely something that's
been talked about here and there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, it's the exposure rate that
you're in.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in a grow room for six to eight
hours a day, it's definitely great.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to cover.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have tattoos, so that's why I choose to
use... I use long sleeves and hats and
[SPEAKER_11]: glasses and all that stuff because then my
ink doesn't fade and I don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_11]: about all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have heard from some of my homies
that are in the Cali early in Aspil,
[SPEAKER_11]: they get down.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's solid.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys are tatted up.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're tatted up, it's going to be a
sexy tattoo model.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, he is tatted up, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's tatted up.
[SPEAKER_11]: His pubes are tatted up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where his pubes should be, there's a
tattoo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a tattoo of pubes.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can see the difference though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see the difference in your arm
tattoos and your body tattoos from having
[SPEAKER_11]: a shirt and where you're exposed.
[SPEAKER_11]: The dude's tatted, guys, and you can... I
know what you have to go through at the
[SPEAKER_11]: MED to be an owner of a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can only imagine they documented...
He saw there was a whole page of your
tattoos.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I've seen other stories of they
did each leg tattoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually like, do you think you
should formalize this?
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, no, just writing it on a
piece of paper, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I'm not really trying to...
They asked for all of your tattoos and
[SPEAKER_11]: what they are and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I literally had to sit down and
figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just went by body part and I just
told him all the body parts that were
[SPEAKER_11]: tattooed, which is pretty much every one
other than a couple.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a hundred dollar bill in my dick
because I like to play with my money.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, if you want to find out if that's
true, come to the Cannabis Grand Crew in
[SPEAKER_11]: Aspen this November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag wiener tattoo.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, actually I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next Cannabis Grand Crew is May 30th
in Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: CannabisGrandCrew.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to check it out and come
party.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, I can't make that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's captured 500 people and it's going to
be a great panel of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless the Grammy Gatsby is paying for
that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'd rather go to the crew.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, you fly me out there and
give me a hotel room and we'll go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get sponsored on that 2,500
milligrams too.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I'll donate my 25 over there and then
I'll just go out there to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting worked over on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag fam is fam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fam is fam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grammy Gats all day long.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hear a guitar just went brink and
we're promised a song after a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the bread song going to come out today?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this the first global release of the
bread song?
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been going for an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did this one on Call of Duty for like an
hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's some people heard it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some 12 year olds on Call of Duty
that got the brunt of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone got the live stream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, we haven't practiced it in a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can try to lay something down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I probably got muted like five seconds
into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I quit using it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even play anymore because it's
just everyone trolling everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I play all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We weren't even playing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just singing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, actually, you know what else?
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you get into the song though,
I mean, you guys did like a nice little
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty facelift over at Turbex with the
logo on the website.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come in and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually just got to me today and
changed it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's definitely a lot better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the website is going to have all
the places where we sell Turbex,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask if there was a bunch of
places you guys knew of where folks can
[SPEAKER_11]: get it, but it's only medical.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't want to tease all the
out-of-staters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll still tease all the out-of-staters.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says homeboys sitting here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well just say green and healthy
wellness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there for- There in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hung out for what?
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 literally.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hung out for somewhere between an hour,
30 and 40 minutes, maybe an hour today.
[SPEAKER_11]: And half the customers that showed up were
recreational people hoping to shop and you
[SPEAKER_11]: had to turn them away and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope Colorado Springs- Yeah,
got to pass that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are in Colorado Springs,
we would really appreciate it if you have
[SPEAKER_11]: the chance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell the people that you can about the
shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, if you feel like it and you're in
support of the cannabis movement,
[SPEAKER_11]: obviously tell your local representative
what's going on because we don't have any
[SPEAKER_11]: rec cannabis other than Denver and some
other places like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just get your card for now,
which sucks, but that's- Or just if you
[SPEAKER_07]: need rec, go drive down to Pueblo and see
Mr. Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go down to the spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on down to the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're trying new stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sports fans.
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I'd get a chorus of monkeys,
but- I was just taking a- Getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to try that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to apologize.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you opened up the paper was to
drop the getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't want to say getting globby
again on accident.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to read slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tell you, if you're in the right
situation in an event and you yell out
[SPEAKER_11]: getting slabby, you will find out where
the terpy crew is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you will.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens to me often.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be at the cup and some random kid
from fucking no melt Nebraska is going to
[SPEAKER_11]: go, getting slabby.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of my homies in distress and
you guys will go run and just be some-
[SPEAKER_11]: Nebraska kid with 45 hat pins in a
mothership rig, walking around saying
[SPEAKER_11]: knock off mothership.
[SPEAKER_11]: Knock off mothership.
[SPEAKER_11]: Knock off mothership.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's with the mothership hype anyway?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I just sold mine for
almost three times what I paid for it back
[SPEAKER_07]: in 2012, so I was pretty happy about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hype is the fact that they're hard to
get and a lot of the people that are seen
[SPEAKER_07]: as the top OG, triple OG, OG of the
industry- To be heady, bro, you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a mothership, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of- This rig hits pretty well
and it didn't cost my car.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've hit that thing numerous times and I
like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you had to use your inhaler,
sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring that fucker back over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sold my mothership for 10 months
rent.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go, son.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like a pair of Jordans,
you know, is all that little rig was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I bought it- This one named Eleven
Breds.
[SPEAKER_11]: From the blower, instead of getting it
from some random distributor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mad Rob.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out Mad Rob again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out 719.
[SPEAKER_06]: 719.
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming at you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Garden of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not my shatter.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was passed to me and I was told,
here, hit this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's that and there's a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll make it all work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to TASC, Highly Educated
Titanium.
[SPEAKER_11]: TASC Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one in the biz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about all the verbal diarrhea over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my hash, but I'd love to see
you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not taking you to the ER tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I already told you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to get you an oxygen tank along
with that fucking inhaler.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be Mr. Burns and all the way down the
hallway with this shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody know CPR in this room?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my inhaler.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was certified like four years ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably hadn't changed that much.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just stomp on that middle part of his
chest until he breathes again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, Grandpa Gats, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't CPR be like, I need that bad mood
and rising?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that CPR?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, different band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's CCR.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind, that's CCR.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was good, though.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a nice try.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe you actually grabbed the
microphone for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do need to say this, though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love kicking it with Jeff because he
goes to comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: He has an awesome sense of humor,
but the homeboy's timing is impeccable
[SPEAKER_11]: with most of his shit when he's dropping
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: The take out your retainer bit,
I wish we were recording for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was about to take a little hit of his
albuterol because he was choking his
[SPEAKER_11]: wheezing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked him if he had to pull out his
inhaler to hit it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or pull out his retainer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a psych out like baseball right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good when I'm on it, but when I'm
not, boy, it's sloppy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave you a compliment about timing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That rescues it all right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget when you're out there by
yourself, and you don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Temps down, terps up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Temps down, terps up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get sloppy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let that nail cool down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Drop that dab on the nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: Drop that nut on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Drop your nuts on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then put them in apothecana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put those in apothecana, and that's how
you know the nail is just right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, apothecana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you put the dab on there,
and you get a little puke taste and a
[SPEAKER_11]: little turpex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's delish.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like no melt mixed with turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ball Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ball Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag sac-terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sac-terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wok-terps.
Purple kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you I was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you I was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, it's a symptom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to cue the guitar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Time to cue the guitar.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've had enough dabs that it's
probably bread song time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've smoked more in this hour
sitting here talking to you guys than I
[SPEAKER_07]: have in one sitting in a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how The Go From Your Heart podcast
happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: We dab it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually it's all my dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody has got to hoist the microphone
in front of the guitar so that we can get
[SPEAKER_11]: some audio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember this one, Pops?
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless somebody's got a- You know it,
son.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you got a quarter inch cable,
I could jack you straight in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get me on the sexual one here,
jacking him straight in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just mic you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just mic him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd turn up the gain and mic you up
a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny with the banger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag super puns.
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been a turp-tastic episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hazy up in this room now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we get out of control with music,
I'm really going to thank you guys like
[SPEAKER_11]: truly before we get all ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, fucking thanks.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of my better episodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get a lot of listens.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a great show.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a blast.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to get this fun vibe on the
show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get everyone too high.
[SPEAKER_11]: And with this many people, it's super
exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, being high or whatever,
I just had a fucking dope time kicking it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you ever want to come back over to the
fucking turp trap house to get down,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to leave the gear and we'll just
record again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jordan, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you ready to jam?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready, son.

[SPEAKER_07]: Take it from the top.

[SPEAKER_07]: Try not to make me laugh, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pause for the slab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pause for the slab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag slabbing and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys good?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably the hardest I've laughed
in a fucking long time on that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: When he went in, did you hear what I said?
[SPEAKER_11]: I just nodded on my nose into my fucking
mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you keeping all the bread by JT
and the boys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all the bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear what I said?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all my fucking
bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, did you hear what I said?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for that fucking bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the kind that you eat, but the kind
that you smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want some bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear what I said?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want that fucking bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't even listen to a fucking word I
said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all the bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all the bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all the bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all the bread?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you even hear a single fucking word I
said?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you keeping all the bread?
[SPEAKER_11]: That literally was straight off the World
Police soundtrack.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was one of the best things I fucking
heard all week.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to turn my microphone off because I
was laughing so hard I was snorting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told you bro, that first one you hit I
fucking blew it all over my mustache.
[SPEAKER_11]: That one was good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was fucking crying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your nature boy Rick Flair was over here
holding his tears in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we make a song about the podcast
right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Freestyle?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, freestyle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Off the cunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe when you're done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to talk about dabbing or is it
going to be about growing from your heart?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be about everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it should be about grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might sing about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might sing about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might sing about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might sing about you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to sing, it's got to be grow from
the heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to back you up man and play
the strings.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me shout out to Dan on the strings.
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we play for a minute?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll read a couple things to end up the
show and then you guys can just sing us on
[SPEAKER_11]: the way out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, thanks for listening because it was
fucking fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are going to play a little bit
of a music thing and then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_11]: talk over it and then we'll let them
finish it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thanks for everybody
listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, if you ever come to any one of our
companies or our stores, we all have this
[SPEAKER_11]: much fun every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every day, all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thanks for everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: When he shows up, he gives you a hug and
tells he loves you when he comes to the
[SPEAKER_11]: shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing I can definitely say.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all incredibly fortunate to be doing
something that we love every day and we
[SPEAKER_07]: try to have as much fun as we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: As much fun as possible every day and that
is pretty fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks Jeff for having us out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a fucking really fun time.

[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is he saying half the time?

[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got the turbex crew.

[SPEAKER_05]: That's about an hour from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm kind of scared to go there.

[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm unfamiliar with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to go there soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: To check out Rasta Jeff's new rec spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell fucking yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to go buy an ounce of that lemon

[SPEAKER_05]: Going to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a quote from your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to choir school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about you guys, but I've been
walking around singing No Belt Nebraska
[SPEAKER_11]: for like a week now.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been stuck in my head for days.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only downfall is they used a lot of
inside jokes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they tried to explain them to the best
of the ability, but it's more one of those
[SPEAKER_10]: things that you had to bend there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just laughing every time they would
say something like ham wallet or some
[SPEAKER_11]: shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: The ham wallet in the beginning was,
it got pushed off like it wasn't anything
offensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was letting shit just slide by because
the more I was like, oh shit, the more it
[SPEAKER_11]: came out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was fun to do, but it was fun just
letting some shit slide too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you would hear one of them,
like everyone throughout the podcast,
[SPEAKER_10]: like you edit this, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you were like, no, no, I just,
I'm too lazy for that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recorded three hours with those guys and
I just cut out an hour and 20 right out of
[SPEAKER_11]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_11]: They started playing No Belt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I'm going to record from
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are getting recorded.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't know I'd been recording for
like a full hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like you guys don't realize I've
been recording for at least a minute now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys ready to do a podcast?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to drop an intro song.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time for episode number 60 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_11]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_11]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_11]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_11]: for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_11]: As always, I have to send a huge big thank
you shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to say thanks for letting me use
their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big, huge thanks to Kat Koot and the
entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're hanging out today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got Mike and Adam at the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you boys doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm DTFO.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm dabbed the fuck out today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Been dabbing on some turpex shatter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also got some black cherry chem shatter
from the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a good day.
[SPEAKER_10]: When, what day is it that you're not
dabbed the fuck out though?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, early in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Early in the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Early in the Merlin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are, I surprisingly don't dab early
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not an early morning dabber.
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to wait until I at least get a few
things done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've, I've come over here a couple
of times and it's like seven, 10,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, first one of the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to do work before you dab out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get a, if I dab too early, I get lazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to go right back to bed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if I dab during work,
when I'm trying to get a lot of shit done,
[SPEAKER_11]: I just get out of focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do the same thing to myself,
a flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just try to wait and reward yourself a
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grateful dog right after breakfast,
like it's going to be a real productive
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: My buddy Mitch Shinasu, shout out Mitch.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said that when you're dabbing every
hour becomes 45 minutes of productive
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then I kind of believe him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would argue with that between Sativa and
Inika.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you're a real big Sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And usually if I come over here and get
real ripped off Sativa dabs, I don't go
[SPEAKER_10]: home and like, no, I'm like, what can we
clean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where, where do we need to?
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of get that way, but I ended up
doing some useless shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like something that didn't even need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_10]: My desk is organized.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Completely organized.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the dishes are perfectly clean in the
kitchen, but it was useless.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have been doing way different
stuff at the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a good Sativa though, the spring
clean that just happened at my house would
[SPEAKER_00]: not have happened.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff got extra attention that it
definitely didn't deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of my books didn't need to be
pulled out and dusted and put back on a
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf, but it happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: See that's the shit that some dabs will do
to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little too much Sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I catch myself?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take a dab and then I don't know how
I do it, but I'm on Instagram suddenly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm standing just in the middle of a
hallway or in the middle of the kitchen
[SPEAKER_11]: or- People are just flowing around you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just Instagramming like a
motherfucker and don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what was going on here in my head a
minute ago and what am I supposed to be
[SPEAKER_11]: doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't dab during the day sometimes,
but when I do bro, I dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once I start dabbing, it's game on.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to keep your dabs per hour high
once you start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dabs per hour, DPH.
[SPEAKER_10]: Deep.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds dirty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't say it like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't say it like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So guys, we're going to talk about,
I've got some news articles I want to
[SPEAKER_11]: read.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to talk about some Jamaican
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to mention something about
ladybugs that a listener emailed me about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we have time, I might talk about my
Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure how far we're going to get
with all the news articles that I found.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I do want to mention,
it's our birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Episode 60 is the one year anniversary of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: One year.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering when this was actually
going to come around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know how you were going to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be out like March 29th,
I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think today, the 29th, 28th is the
day that the first episode was ever
[SPEAKER_11]: released.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's take some dabs for the birthday
and then we'll read some commercials.
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you guys the option.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got some SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got Gorilla Glue and I've got
Lemonade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one should we dab here?
[SPEAKER_10]: You already know that I'm going to pitch
towards the SFV because it is a dank
[SPEAKER_10]: strain from TURPEX and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said Lemonade and my tongue did a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I haven't tasted yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure that by the end of the show,
we're going to dab all three.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start with the SFV and then we got
to give Mike little baby dabs,
[SPEAKER_11]: but we'll start with the SFV.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the San Fernando Valley Kush,
made popular.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really popular from the Cali
connection is who put out the seeds,
[SPEAKER_11]: but people are going to be like,
they didn't make it popular, but they put
[SPEAKER_11]: out the seeds of the SFV and it's a great
breeding strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a super nice high.
[SPEAKER_11]: TURPEX blasted, extracted this and
everything TURPEX does is qualitative.
[SPEAKER_11]: They changed their labels.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like their new logo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also check out their new website.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do a hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I have been driving around in my car
and just randomly like I've got
[SPEAKER_11]: Tourette's.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be like, no melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_11]: For the past seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife has no idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: But she has no idea what it is,
but she's definitely heard it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like every time I'm sitting in there
hitting the bowl, it just, it comes out
[SPEAKER_10]: whether there's no melt or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I've got maybe another day
before I get the deadpan look from mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right, stop, pause the
song, explain what the fuck are they
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the eighth time I've heard this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: As I was setting up for the podcast,
I was reading a news article and Mike
[SPEAKER_11]: just, I'm going to give you a listen and
hit play.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, what are you giving me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's playing the no melt theme song in
the intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck in my head, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to, you got to play it to get it
out of your head, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You download it to your phone,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have it forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have it forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be, there's that song number
three on your phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I know your playlist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like most of the episodes of the
podcast and then I have that new Afro man
[SPEAKER_00]: cut because I got high because that's
just, that's the only song on your phone,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to put some order back to this
show.
[SPEAKER_11]: The SFV we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: It made me cough a little.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my fault.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: It tastes really, uh, it's earthy,
cushy, maybe a hint of coffee.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah, it's got a good, nice earthy,
cushy flavor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely approve.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it's not a sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: It made my eyes go and it made me get a
little slow.
[SPEAKER_11]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_11]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have to smoke a sativa here
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm interested in this lemonade.
[SPEAKER_10]: My new favorite Terp X string,
at least this run this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I smoked quite a bit of SFV between
the water hash and what the buddies,
[SPEAKER_10]: what my buddies smoke, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The last, I got four grand, I got four
flavors last time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the lemonade, I got the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got the gorilla glue and, uh,
the one I got was the chem and G.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that chem and G was, it's gone now,
if that tells you anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was my favorite, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so turpentine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that nectar was good then.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was, it was definitely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on it was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on this is pretty killer too
with the flavor on that chem and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't, um, I noticed through this,
like, I mean, I didn't just hack off of
[SPEAKER_10]: that and it wasn't a huge dab,
but this, and it, um, and it, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: it made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was, yeah, I'm nice and mellow now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely have heavy eyes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've noticed that I don't get the eye high
from dabs like I used to when I would
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke just flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean red or?
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know when your eyes just get
droopy and they just feel like fucking
[SPEAKER_11]: back in the day, dude, your eyes would
just get so heavy and everyone would look
[SPEAKER_11]: at you and be like, you're so high,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Open your eyes.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like I can't, uh, dabs seem to
make me bug eyed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's so intense that I'm like,
oh, I'm on edge with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I kind of miss the eye high and I'm
getting that from this, uh, SFV right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: While I'm dabbed out issue, did everybody
get a dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: You got one right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not coughing, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Appropriately sized dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike's got to take dabs for ants over
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been rambling for a minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do need to do two commercials.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody's going to shout out to Bernie.
[SPEAKER_11]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at High Girl Indoor Growing

[SPEAKER_11]: grow supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check this out guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you go to High Girl Indoor Growing
Supplies, when you're checking out,
[SPEAKER_11]: tell them, I listened to the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to give you commercial
pricing on everything you purchase.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to pay the same amount that I
pay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to pay what Adam pays.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to pay what Mike pays.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to pay what Jesse pays and
Jesse works there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We get a better discount than Jesse gets,
and he's the manager at the joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to be honest, like you don't
need a discount there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are the best.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best priced thing in town.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you part of the, you said we,
are you part of the team?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just, I think we all kind of are part
of High Girl because we all love Bern and
[SPEAKER_11]: Bern's a- Jesse's my brother, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesse's our brother, but Bern's a young
lady who weighs like a hundred pounds and
[SPEAKER_11]: they get a truck dropped off and they just
throw the truck out there and they're
[SPEAKER_11]: like, here's all your shit, Bern.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we all love her and we will all
grab a pile of soil or whatever we can
[SPEAKER_11]: move for her.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, we are all part of team High
Girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can call us that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That community is what I would say.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they let us have our meetings back
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next grow meeting, April 26,
that High Girl indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the meeting will start at six o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will have something prepared.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will speak about something.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it'll be yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesse and I will collaborate and talk
about what needs to be discussed.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've got an idea and you're coming to
the meeting, let me know what you'd like
[SPEAKER_11]: me to talk about at the grow meeting,
April 26, that High Girl indoor growing
[SPEAKER_11]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll talk about that more in the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep reminding you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I felt like at the last grow meeting,
like a lot of stuff was talked about
[SPEAKER_10]: pretense, but then when it came down to
who's got any questions, everybody was
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe a little embarrassed to speak up in
front of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it wasn't, it's because you're in a
community of growers and I don't think
[SPEAKER_10]: that should be the place to be
embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the place to get help.
[SPEAKER_10]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but nobody wanted to show that there
were yellow belts when there were fifth
[SPEAKER_11]: degree black belts in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of talent there, it would have
been rough to be the first kid to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spence recommended that we write down
questions and put them in a hat and that
[SPEAKER_11]: way nobody knows who brought us that
silly-ass question.
[SPEAKER_11]: One more commercial.
[SPEAKER_11]: The organic portions of this episode are
sponsored by my great friends at the Rocky
[SPEAKER_11]: Mountain Worm Company.

[SPEAKER_11]: that Adam uses, that Sean uses,
that half of Pueblo uses right now,
[SPEAKER_11]: that most of Colorado Springs is using.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get those shipped.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we kind of helped them out with
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm
Company.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get them shipped right to your
door.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check out rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get all the same shit I'm using.
[SPEAKER_11]: The prices are amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The products are great.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you visit the store at 411 Tijuana
Street in Colorado Springs, make sure you
[SPEAKER_11]: tell them you heard about them through the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shake their hand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be cool with them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those guys are friendly.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not just business people.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are community members of the Grow
community.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the hype on that stuff is real.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hype is real, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike has the... Excuse my coughing.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike has the privilege of taking my old
soil out of the pot and putting it into
[SPEAKER_11]: the recycling bin for soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a serious privilege, bitches.
[SPEAKER_10]: D or T mover.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to play with dirt all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see... In the past 20 pots that we
have harvested, have you seen a massive
[SPEAKER_11]: increase in my root mass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of root material in these pots
is insane lately, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breaking up dirt pots for a
fucking disgustingly long amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's been breaking up an old
pot and had like a hand full of little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny sad ass root there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lately you've got to smash the root
ball against the wall for a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get some dirt back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been intense.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not in there any longer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to say, well, you just let
them grow more time.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're actually in there shorter
because I ran this crop really quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to get some pictures of the crop
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just an insane amount of
incredibly healthy root material.
[SPEAKER_10]: And see, that's kind of what I was
pointing at is like, if you're using that,
[SPEAKER_10]: would it be better to kind of transplant
more, you know, more often or just
[SPEAKER_10]: because...
[SPEAKER_11]: A larger pot would have been helpful,
but it wasn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A larger pot from the get-go, I wouldn't
necessarily say transplanting more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently would be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know, we've gotten it down,
not to brag on ourselves, where you can
[SPEAKER_11]: transplant some shit where there's like
zero stress, where the plants are even
[SPEAKER_11]: happier.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, oh, that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get to stretch a little more at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So once you guys get comfortable,
I like to go myself, I go from the cloner
[SPEAKER_11]: into a cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I've been introduced to a new
product that I really like.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just called a clone cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can order them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where to order them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were kicked down to me as a gift for
a trial.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really like them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're harder than a normal cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a little bigger than a normal cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're raised a little and they've got
holes to where they can drain a little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: better.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the clone cup company, I really like
those.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys are listening, I could use
like 90 of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: 90 would be cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: The solo cups, you got to poke them
yourself and they squeeze together when
[SPEAKER_11]: you try to scoop dirt into them.
[SPEAKER_11]: These cups are a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can wash them and reuse them.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to keep going to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I go from the cloner into that cup and
then I let it get kind of, kind of close
[SPEAKER_11]: to root bound in that cup, but not,
I just want to see the thick roots on the
[SPEAKER_11]: outside.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I picked up the dirt, I want to see
roots, but I don't let the plant start to
[SPEAKER_11]: stretch in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I go to a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then sometimes if I'm doing like a
breeding, a phenohunt, I'll run them in
[SPEAKER_11]: the three.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll flower them out in the three gallon
when they're real short.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm going bigger, I'll throw them into
a seven gallon and flower them out in a
[SPEAKER_11]: seven.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just added Grokashi, worm castings,
the Dragonfly Earth medicine root dust,
[SPEAKER_11]: the black one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't think of the name.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bottle's not over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just simple stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did a little bit of fish hydrosolate
and I've started to cut out the OGT.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not using OGT now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And dude, my roots were huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super duper huge.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could have used a bigger pot,
but I don't think it was necessary.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I did the right amount.
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't root bound, but the roots
were spaghetti-like.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just know that since we've started using
them, having them in cups is almost like,
[SPEAKER_10]: is it okay today?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it okay today?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's, you're literally,
you have to be on your stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you leave them, they're going
to... And that's, I mean, regular plants
[SPEAKER_10]: do, but with the worm casting,
it is fierce.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to go out and order a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I said I had a bunch of news,
but since we're talking about all this
[SPEAKER_11]: organic stuff, another thing that I've
noticed that has really contributed to the
[SPEAKER_11]: improvement in my plants, I use it in my
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_11]: I use it in my flowering room,
everything, but the clones gets it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The clones get it now.
[SPEAKER_11]: As soon as they go into the dirt,
I feed it this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sean gave me something called a Bokashi
bucket.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Bokashi bucket is basically a five
gallon bucket with a piece of plastic as a
[SPEAKER_11]: catch or a shelf in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then that shelf has holes in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then underneath that shelf is a
spigot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the idea is that you throw,
we'll talk about more in a minute with
[SPEAKER_11]: more detail, but you throw your shit in
there and it starts to get funky.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can turn the spigot and get
the shit out, is why that little shelf is
[SPEAKER_11]: in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You get juice out of it.
Juice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a miniature compost pile juicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best way and set up like a
Gatorade thing in a football city.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great way, because I was going way,
way a different way.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you take the Bokashi bucket and when I
got mine, I put the little shelf in there
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's got a little shelf that you put
down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them have it pre-affixed.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's different models of the bucket
that you get.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a little shelf in there with
holes in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I put down a thin layer of newspaper,
just one sheet of newspaper so that I made
[SPEAKER_11]: more of a screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I put a small layer of the
Bokashi down.
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes with some powdered stuff called
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_11]: I sprinkled about a handful of that on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what you do is you just put,
I put, I'm a vegetarian and every banana
[SPEAKER_11]: that I eat has a banana peel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every strawberry that I eat has that
little, the leafy part at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some strawberries that come in
the package that are inedible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I eat an onion, the way I clean
my onion is I chop each end off of the
[SPEAKER_11]: onion, and then I can get that onion skin
right off of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I've got an end of each,
or each end of it and the onion skin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I clean it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That ends and the skin go into my little
bowl.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once I've got this bowl filled,
I throw all my banana peels, my egg
[SPEAKER_11]: shells, my onion ends, my carrots that got
funky, the celery that I forgot to eat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Coffee grounds are, you have to dry them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Set them out and let them dry first if
you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do my Yerba Mate that I've cooked or
that I've used.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my coffee grounds, you've got to set
them on a paper towel and let them dry for
[SPEAKER_11]: like 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to put too much moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could explain why, but it's too much to
go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything fruit or veggie, what else can
go in there?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can put meat and dairy in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can put your meat and dairy products
and bread in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I choose not to put, I don't eat any meat
or dairy and I only put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: bread in there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that just doesn't even happen in this
house.
[SPEAKER_11]: None of that comes here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just put the vegetables and the
fruits and shit in there and all the,
[SPEAKER_11]: like some grapes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there's apple cores and potato
peels.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you put, they say to put a two inch
layer of food waste in there and then
[SPEAKER_11]: sprinkle a handful of the Bokashi and then
another two inch layer and sprinkle a
[SPEAKER_11]: handful of Bokashi and try not to open it
very often.
[SPEAKER_11]: I throw all of my scraps into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_11]: And once the bowl has starts to sneak up
the kitchen, then I put that in the
[SPEAKER_11]: Bokashi bucket.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike, you've been here when I opened the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend going full work and
keeping it in your kitchen like some
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't open it up to put the scraps in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pop the lid on that sucker,
it is ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell the magic worker.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're fermenting banana peels,
apple cores, grapes.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are eggshells in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's avocados in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like everything I've used that comes out
of the novel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you keep putting, you keep packing your
fruit and vegetables in there or your food
[SPEAKER_11]: waste.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can put your bacon and eggs in there
if you want to.
[SPEAKER_11]: All your food waste can go in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you pack it down with this little
packer and keep sprinkling in the Kashi
[SPEAKER_11]: and then you seal it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after about, it took me about 10
days, about 10 days, you unscrew the
[SPEAKER_11]: spigot that's on there and I put a mason
jar underneath it and this juice comes out
[SPEAKER_11]: and it starts off clear and kind of pink
or orange-ish.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it smells like, it is like the bar
trash can they got thrown up in and left
[SPEAKER_11]: in the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like it should be a game in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should just have the jar sitting here
and people be like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you should just be like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: The jar is sitting.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see the jar.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see the jar and I don't want no part
of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to be part of this game.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: The juice that comes out of there,
I throw that into a thing of clean water
[SPEAKER_11]: with a bubbler and it bubbles up real good
and it makes the stinkiest funky shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feed that to my plants and I can see
them dance around.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a ladder on our bucket.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a quick hole and just slide the
tube through and that's the end of that
[SPEAKER_10]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants love it people, but good God,
it's ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real delicate stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more details.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll fill it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost to the top now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I've got one more good dump of
my bowl of banana peels.
[SPEAKER_11]: I eat a lot of bananas.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have a banana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Addiction.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're really good for me and
they give me a lot of energy and they're
[SPEAKER_11]: healthy and they're organic and I eat them
in like a million ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been eating the shit out of bananas.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out to bananas.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've got one more dump into there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once I dumped that bowl into
there, I'm out of Kashi.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I won't even be able to put more Kashi
in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll seal it and let it seal for about 14
days.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything that's in there is
essentially pickling.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like fermenting and pickling in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll pull out juice out of there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I call it Kashi juice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably get five, six, maybe eight
to 10 depending on how, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_11]: soggy the top layer is going to get.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get eight to 10 jars hopefully of
that Kashi juice out of there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I will take two large kiddie
pools of soil and I will put half of that
[SPEAKER_11]: Kashi bucket on the bottom of one kiddie
pool and half of the Kashi bucket on
[SPEAKER_11]: another kiddie pool and cover that up with
store-bagged soil and mix that shit in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in like 14 to 21 days,
we'll have some dank composted soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just watched Mike's eyes like
immediately go pointed inwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, wait a minute, didn't I say I'm the
one that messes with the soil?
[SPEAKER_10]: You just wait for that bath time,
okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Two kiddie pools, one with grow Kashi,
bro Kashi.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other would be worm castings
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: There won't be any worm castings in there
just yet, but in the future there will be
[SPEAKER_11]: castings added to that same soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that soil will get, that'll just be
the bait.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we'll only need a little bit of that
soil per the regular soil mixing bin.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just cut it down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it'll make some dank soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be a lot of microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike does not look excited about this at
all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, that smell ain't ever coming out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So between the worm castings- You wear
clothes to ruin like that day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wear something you don't like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Between the worm castings, the grow Kashi,
what else are we using?
[SPEAKER_11]: Fish hydrosolates and the dragonfly earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should see the roots on my plants and
the veg growth happening in my plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other things that we still have
to supplement and stuff, but my roots are
[SPEAKER_11]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super impressed and I'm making my own
shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can make, with a handful of worm
castings, with one jar of that Kashi tea,
[SPEAKER_11]: with 15 scoops of grow Kashi, which sounds
like a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 10 scoops of grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's never enough grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just use the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You really can't hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you can, but- And if you want to
use molasses, it's like just like five
[SPEAKER_11]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't want to use molasses,
you don't need it, but you could make,
[SPEAKER_11]: I made 25 gallons of nutrients with just
that right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was totally amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Green plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Green, happy plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: All my veg plants, all my clones that got
put into new pots, they all got fed that
[SPEAKER_11]: and they look completely happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: They love life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything is pretty much been switched
over to organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a good way you guys to recycle
all of your garden stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good way, or all your garden
stuff, all your waste, all your food
[SPEAKER_11]: waste.
[SPEAKER_11]: What the heck happened to my papers?
[SPEAKER_11]: They all landed in the wrong order.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're backwards and it's weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm confused on what to do anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try to fix it without anybody
noticing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just take your food scraps and throw it
in there and you can make your own
[SPEAKER_11]: nutrients, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can save the world one drink at a time,
one food at a time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen people put paper towels and
Kleenex and stuff in there too,
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll biodegrade in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you look to me like, that's
disgusting, but I mean, it's rotten banana
[SPEAKER_11]: peels and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already pretty damn gross.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's gross, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not looking forward to smelling the
industrial size one.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a video.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the... I was looking for the
Grokashi website.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find theirs.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another guy that does it in 55
gallon drums and he runs farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in their picture in a row of 55
gallon drums in the big salad bowl size
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was dumping it into five gallon buckets
and missing a portion of each one.
[SPEAKER_11]: All over his feet.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you don't smell it at that point.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that town to the east of here?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the town I'm talking about where
it's just cows, like crammed into fences.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sell them there or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could taste cow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of how Greeley smells.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greeley is kind of cow poopy.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I received an email.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me... Where the heck?
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is my phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to find this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ladybugs I've been hearing
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the ladybug email I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned a little bit about emails.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm searching for this message.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Said I learned a little bit about emails,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the words that just came out of
your head.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm multitasking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, yesterday, bro, I got hit in the
head so hard that I don't remember half of
[SPEAKER_11]: my evening and I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were at a friend's house who... Did you
deserve it?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was an accident.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did it to myself, so it's even funnier.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are two stairs that dip down into
this other part of these people's house,
[SPEAKER_11]: and right above the stairs, there's a
beam, a head thing, like a fucking... What
[SPEAKER_11]: is it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: A face smasher.
[SPEAKER_11]: A head smasher.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's like a decorative awning thing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The architect was an architect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember hitting it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not feel it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All I remember is getting up off the
ground and Sean looking at me going,
[SPEAKER_11]: dude, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sean has never had that problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to pick up a chair.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went and got the chair and took it to
where I was getting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I set it down, I felt drunk.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, I am fucked up right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything was gray.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Smith says like, you want to dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, a big one, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt weird all night.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had someone come hang out with me last
night and they were like, you're like
[SPEAKER_11]: loopy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, I told you, I got hit in
the head hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, dude, it was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smacked in my ass.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, face smash.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't feel it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't hurt until when I sat down
later, because I got hit so hard,
[SPEAKER_11]: mine just went out.
[SPEAKER_11]: My body was like, sleepy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on the floor at Spence's house,
just laying there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've all had one of those.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens a lot in this town.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of short.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody was pretty worried about me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look on their faces.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, it was loud.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they all stood up and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell was I going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm way distracted.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Suddenly I feel like I had a head injury
again.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this dude, he asked me not to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's parts of this email that I won't
read because some of it was just for me,
[SPEAKER_11]: but he opens with, first of all,
thanks for the awesome pod.
[SPEAKER_11]: Love your style and Mystic Roots were a
perfect fit for bed music.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome to read this on the pod,
but please don't mention my real name.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just use VapeDad on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very active in r slash trees.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then he talks about his soil, where he is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he says, I was reading a book
called Cannabis Cultivation the other day
[SPEAKER_11]: at Barnes and Noble, and they recommended
putting ladybugs in our greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_11]: fight aphids and caterpillars and a whole
assortment of pests.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm researching organic growing for no
other reason than I like the all-natural
[SPEAKER_11]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thinking like this, I was wondering,
would it be a good idea to raise loose
[SPEAKER_11]: ladybugs in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_11]: What could they hurt in the stages of
growth, if anything, or could these be
[SPEAKER_11]: nature's pest control for those aspiring
to care give?
[SPEAKER_11]: This may be a dumb question, but I just
wanted to ask a live person with some real
[SPEAKER_11]: quantifiable growing experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, thanks for the pod and keep it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really beautiful thing you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, I hope you get invited to the
Joe Rogan Experience pod one day,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I know your plants would miss you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for all the free grow info.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much love, VapeDad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I say his real name, that email at
all?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make sure that I did not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty high, but I don't think you
did.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_11]: So many cool things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, you're welcome for all the free grow
info.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am proud and happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: My goal is to quit growing all the mids,
start fucking eliminating all the no-melt
[SPEAKER_11]: Nebraska, get everybody growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody needs to be growing high quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And all I have to do is talk into a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm really excited to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe Rogan Experience podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, if I got there, I don't know what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be super stoked to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just sit there and grin into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably what I would do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to be on that show with Ari and
Joey Diaz and Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hate.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hate that would come from that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you haters, but I'd love to be on
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And dude, you said this may be a dumb
question.
[SPEAKER_11]: No dumb questions, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never.
[SPEAKER_11]: No dumb questions at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had training wheels at one point and now
I'm doing wheelies and you just got to
[SPEAKER_11]: start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no dumb questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: My theory on ladybugs, and Michael
probably backed me up on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: A long time ago, I did what I thought was
cute and I went to the hydro store and I
[SPEAKER_11]: bought a thousand ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've been thinking about your
experiment while you were reading the
[SPEAKER_11]: email.
[SPEAKER_11]: Opened up the container and let them fly
about the grow room.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were cute.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got out the camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: I took pictures of ladybugs fucking on my
plants and it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_11]: See Adams, yup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Been there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They sell 300 in Florida.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lights went out and then the next day
I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1500?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like the envelope, the t-shirt
from Amazon shows up.
[SPEAKER_11]: He just opened that fucker and dumped all
the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the next morning, if I released 1500 of
them the next morning, there were 50 alive
[SPEAKER_11]: in that bitch.
[SPEAKER_11]: They fly into all your fans.
[SPEAKER_11]: They fly up into your lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's something that Sean taught me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Credit to Sean.
[SPEAKER_11]: He taught me this and I'm going to butcher
it because I had a head injury that night.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladybugs don't see in the same spectrum as
humans.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladybugs see a UV spectrum that's only
provided by the light.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we take a ladybug and we put it in
a grow room, all it sees is a grow light
[SPEAKER_11]: and it doesn't see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's confused now and it wants to get
toward the light that it can see and the
[SPEAKER_11]: warmth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it flies into your hoods.
[SPEAKER_11]: It flies into your fans and you get to
sweep them all up and they smell terrible.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent months cleaning ladybugs out of
every little corner and nook and cranny in
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucking grow room.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you'd find them in weird places
randomly too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they didn't do much.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are predatory mites that are worth
it, that work indoors, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_11]: that ladybugs, praying mantis are cool
indoors.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't run away.
[SPEAKER_11]: And ladybugs are also migratory creatures.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to take off.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to eat and then they want to fly
away and then they want to eat and then
[SPEAKER_11]: they want to fly away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in my honest opinion, I would say no on
the ladybugs in an indoor situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a greenhouse or an outdoor
situation and you're ready to keep,
[SPEAKER_11]: you're going to have to keep adding to
them and you're also going to have to feed
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They do require food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if there are aphids and shit there,
like you don't want to eat hummus and
[SPEAKER_11]: falafel all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to change.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you got to provide them some kind of
food.
[SPEAKER_11]: So keep that in mind if you're going to
use them in an outdoor or a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_11]: situation, but indoors, I would not do the
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that food could also bring other
pests.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I tell people to release
them around their grow, not in their grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sprinkle them in the front and
backyard and don't bother with them
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise just as like an extra
preventative measure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thing about the mantis is I've
been in a few pet stores here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_10]: and like you guys carry mantis and I'm
expecting to like see a whole fish tank
[SPEAKER_10]: full of mantises and like, yeah,
I'll take 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to order them and they'll send you
eggs and then you got to let the eggs
[SPEAKER_11]: hatch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a website.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Arbico.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: A-R-B-I-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got all kinds of great shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll send you bugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll send you nematodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it is seasonal.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you might not be able to get
everything, but organic pest control at
[SPEAKER_11]: its finest.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like sharing useful shit with
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been going 32 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to go about 45.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe an hour at the most.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also want to read some news
articles.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys want to get into the news?
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, but we can make a two episode thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thinking so?
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of agree with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the way Mike thinks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike is on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take a drink here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to dab some lemonade from
Turbex.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, was it John John that recommended
this to us?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to somebody talk for a second.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was down there, he had not had a
sample of the review yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he couldn't really give me an honest
opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the name was enticing, but names can
be misleading sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all know about the name game.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was interesting hearing about where the
handkerchief came from.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a gamer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike's a gamer.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a pretty fucking funny story
because I didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really a big Uncharted fan,
but that was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_11]: John John, you're the man, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for being on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go back up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go to the Turpey Mansion,
the Turpey Boy Trap House.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of on a semi-frequent basis and do a
podcast up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: John John, you need to be there again at
the next episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll give you your own mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one mic that was being passed around
because there were a lot of people there,
[SPEAKER_11]: dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: People would come in and out.
[SPEAKER_11]: One guy would come in and hear,
hey, my name is Bill and I just want to
[SPEAKER_11]: say Dabs on Dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then he would leave and Larry would come
in and he'd be like, and I didn't know
[SPEAKER_11]: half the people.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just wanted to get in on shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I've loved that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a lot of cool shit, but most of the
time, I give a fuck if I wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that episode was like, damn,
why wasn't I there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't taken anybody to that place with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hiding in the trunk next time you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of my little secret spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you got sneak away friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys are dabbing and everyone in
the house freaks out because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird white guy in the front yard just
staring at the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can come next time and you can be the
producer.
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll teach you how to hook up all the gear
and you can be the producer.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my producer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would stick producer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The producer sounds good.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like official, bro.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have a suit and a tie and no one
would give you any shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's he?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't wear a tie at city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not wearing one of the fucking trap
outs.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take my first dab of this
lemonade from Turbex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to Turbex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I should taste it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what if it's terrible?
Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Jordan, you're on the money right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on the line.
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched a couple of the guys that were
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: The old videos that they did on YouTube
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to be on it all the time and I
guess they got busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you could obviously tell it's
picked up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Businesses picked up from back in the day
and they all got- I'm seeing these fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: dishes everywhere, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet those boys are busy as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are these black Turbex containers?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're popular.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you pull out one of these,
people know what you got.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lemon candy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's another flavor that I can't yet
describe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll hit me in a minute, but it's
definitely a sativa high because my head
[SPEAKER_11]: is going and it made my eyes wobbly,
which is something that only a couple of
[SPEAKER_11]: other strains have ever done to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wobbly eyed sativa hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big- Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that one of us?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a headphone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the- Oh, it's that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's just the email cord.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what happens when the email cord
touches the microphone or the headphone
[SPEAKER_11]: jack.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys heard it at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they did.
[SPEAKER_11]: We sounded like robots for a minute there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll fix it in post.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put half of it to my nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely has the high lemon terpene
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some candy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the name is worthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the name is worthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's definitely some lemonade.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got to go back for a little mini
flavor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second taste.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a wine connoisseur.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Help him out because it is angled.
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll be hung up on that cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke tobacco, people.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the PSA.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, that was pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just worked the email cord,
the mic cable, the card cap, a little bit
[SPEAKER_11]: of multitasking for your high ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only part of me that can't handle is
my fucking lungs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Smokers unite.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all just took the same size dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I took a bigger dab than that and didn't
choke.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was tobacco's fault.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say no to cigarettes, my friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say no to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That butt stone dabs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do some news.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at 37 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just do a couple of these news
articles.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll save a couple for maybe Wednesday or
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually want to give a big shout out to
one of my Facebook friends, Mike Howley.
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to call him Bike Howley.
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be Michael Howley, but he's from
Boston.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a cool ass dude to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows what's up with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's educated.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's smart.
[SPEAKER_11]: He can separate the bullshit from the
truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: He should be more known in our cannabis
community, and I want to give him a shout
[SPEAKER_11]: out right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably doesn't listen to this show in
any way, but huge shout out to Mike Bike
[SPEAKER_11]: Howley.
[SPEAKER_11]: You do a good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate all your Facebook posts.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see how much you try to help and
participate with our community,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I fucking appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I found out about this story,
but it says pot pesticide contamination in
[SPEAKER_11]: Denver grows.
[SPEAKER_11]: The article is by William Breeds,
and it says, I'm going to choke here in a
[SPEAKER_11]: second because I took a huge dab,
but just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Six marijuana grows in Denver were ordered
to quarantine and possibly destroy plant
[SPEAKER_11]: harvest after Denver Fire Department
officials determined that the grow
[SPEAKER_11]: facilities weren't using chemicals
properly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried so hard not to laugh, and the
harder I tried not to, the worse it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike just moved away from the microphone
to sneeze, but head-butted the mic stand
[SPEAKER_11]: with his sneeze.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fucking glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little head-butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was video for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so
[SPEAKER_11]: they're not using chemicals properly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, anybody that's listened to this
podcast for more than three or four
[SPEAKER_11]: episodes already knows what my solution to
part of this problem is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Environmental Protection Agency does not
have acceptable levels for use on cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: since cannabis is illegal on a federal
level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's think about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Solution, anybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: Legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's your first step.
[SPEAKER_11]: That will make this a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: With legalization comes product safety,
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_11]: The CDA does have an unofficial list of
pesticides that can be used on unspecified
[SPEAKER_11]: crops that are intended for human
consumption, however... Oh, consumption,
[SPEAKER_11]: however.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of read that weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the State Marijuana Enforcement
Division has a strict list of allowed
[SPEAKER_11]: pesticides, as well as instructions for
how grow owners have to store and dispose
[SPEAKER_11]: of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: State law also requires that shops write
up standard operating procedures for all
[SPEAKER_11]: pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Denver, dispensaries will now be
required to submit a list of every
[SPEAKER_11]: pesticide used and how much of it is used.
[SPEAKER_11]: Copies of those records must be kept in
the facility where the marijuana is grown.
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, grows must send lists of
pesticides and information on their safety
[SPEAKER_11]: to the Denver Fire Department.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a sign must be placed on the door of
every grow room listing any and all
[SPEAKER_11]: pesticides used.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those businesses that don't comply could
face fines and closures.
[SPEAKER_11]: And let me tell you, I work with a
dispensary and I'm there on a semi-daily
[SPEAKER_11]: basis the past couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, they are not joking when they say
they're going to fine you or close you.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will come in that day, they will find
a violation that day, they will write a
[SPEAKER_11]: $10,000 fine, and they will close your
shop down right on the spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody that's here, leave, you're
closed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at the spot that I represent,
but I've seen it happen to another place.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't get the amount of regulation
and oversight that this industry operates
[SPEAKER_00]: under.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the MED is massive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'm hanging out near the bud room,
I'll hear people, it's been a long time
[SPEAKER_11]: since anyone said it, but you'll hear
people, or people that don't have an ID
[SPEAKER_11]: that want to get in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you just let me in just once?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, dude, this is a billion dollar
operation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know exactly, but I mean,
it's fucking more money than you could
[SPEAKER_11]: even imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to risk all of our business
for one dude to sneak through without his
[SPEAKER_11]: ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every operation in town, you can call a
million dollar business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all on camera.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I saw the price list for just some of
the grow equipment that I ordered the
[SPEAKER_11]: other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, yeah, we need like 30 of
these.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're like, that's this much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, order it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But oh my God, that's a house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we just spent a house on fans.
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to get more into this article.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, the city also says that the
Denver department of public health and
[SPEAKER_11]: environment will be inspecting cultivation
sites as well as infuse used product
[SPEAKER_11]: manufacturing sites.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what was happening, you guys,
you heard the article, there were some
[SPEAKER_11]: shops in Denver, some grows in Denver that
were using chemicals that should not have
[SPEAKER_11]: been being used on the cannabis that they
were selling to the public.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's my bet that the shops that were
busting out those $75 and $99 ounces,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's probably those guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably the coupons on the phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The ones that you see in the back of the
magazines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are, man, that's terrible that
they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a picture of this article
makes it the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a picture of a guy in like a
Breaking Bad suit with the full on gas
[SPEAKER_11]: mask.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's pouring a bottle of Monsanto
chemicals into another container.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's completely unrelated to anything
to do with the article.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a fear and hype picture is all
it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, watch, I'll turn the computer this
way.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to lean this way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got too many things plugged in,
but look at this shit here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Full on Breaking Bad suit, chemical into
chemical, nothing to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or this article.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like glue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like he's pouring glue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Eagle 20 looks like that,
if you've ever seen Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I kind of assumed, we talked about it,
friends and I, Eagle 20 was probably one
[SPEAKER_11]: of the products being used in all of this
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read it right, the shops that have
their crops quarantined right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn themselves in essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they handed in their form that was
due April 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they started looking at it,
they were like, Hey, wait, that's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever list.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I haven't read that far.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was the only article I've seen about
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was another big change with Hash the
other day where they're like rescheduling
[SPEAKER_10]: it or something like that too,
wasn't there?
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the news article?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I do not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll look for that one on another
episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't even a news article.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hear about this one thing that I'm
not prepared to talk about?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I did not.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I did not.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our correspondent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Correspondent Adam Gaskin shows up
unprepared.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi boss, I'm high as shit and unprepared.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually on Instagram.
Okay.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not even going to be able to find
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this article is super long.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's so much time I've got?
[SPEAKER_11]: I might skip this one and we might give
you guys a Wednesday episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a roll over here to GarageBand.
[SPEAKER_11]: How far are we going?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're not going to do this super long
article.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to save that.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are going to be like,
what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it more lube?
[SPEAKER_11]: More lube?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's referring to the Floria episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not a weird bromance going on
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I scroll down to the cannabis and this
article is by David McFadden of the
[SPEAKER_11]: Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a picture of Bunny Whaler lighting
up a big old bowl in front of a picture of
[SPEAKER_11]: King Haile Selassie.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to the right of him is King Haile
Selassie and the queen sitting right next
[SPEAKER_11]: to him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great shot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll get into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get to the point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Historic new gondolas in Jamaica for
Rastafari religious use, MMJ program.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marijuana has been pervasive, but illegal
in Jamaica for decades.
[SPEAKER_11]: Consumed as a medicinal herb, puffed as a
sacrament by Rastafarians and sung about
[SPEAKER_11]: in the island's famed reggae music.
[SPEAKER_11]: After many years of dialogue about the
culturally entrenched drug and emboldened
[SPEAKER_11]: by changes to drug laws in US states,
Jamaica's parliament on Tuesday night gave
[SPEAKER_11]: final approval to enact decriminalizing
small amounts of pot and establishing a
[SPEAKER_11]: licensing agency to regulate a lawful
medical marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we got medical marijuana in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_11]: The historic amendments paved the way for
a cannabis licensing authority to be
[SPEAKER_11]: established to deal with regulating and
cultivating and distributing and
[SPEAKER_11]: distribution of marijuana for medical and
scientific purposes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Both houses of Jamaica's legislature have
approved this legislation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Mountain Dew was amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: He held that far from the mics and it was
still like a shotgun in my ears.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know people from the South to be like,
that's a good kind of Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_10]: When a beer opens like that, it's like,
that's a good kind of beer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a good kind of beer right
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of them special Mountain Dews.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I'm drinking Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been over a year since I've had
Mountain Dew, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably since I was 16.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like getting off crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body went through a withdrawal for a
minute there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the regular Dew and the faux Dew
at home just in case I run out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he does make his own.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got the little fizz machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in a victory for religious freedom,
adherence to the homegrown Rastafari
[SPEAKER_11]: spiritual movement can now freely use
marijuana for sacramental purposes for the
[SPEAKER_11]: first time on the tropical land.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_11]: The law makes possession of up to two
ounces of marijuana a petty offense that
[SPEAKER_11]: could result in a ticket, but not a
criminal record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation of five- That don't sound
legal white, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they've got medical marijuana now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And dude, before, if you got caught with
cannabis in Jamaica, it was seven days in
[SPEAKER_11]: a Jamaican jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: And seven days in a Jamaican jail,
I'd probably rather do 45 days in a Pueblo
[SPEAKER_11]: jail, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to be anything fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: You sleep on the cement floor with the
rats and you don't get no food.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else is there?
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's two ounces petty offense.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's way better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any
premises would be permitted.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can grow five ganja plants now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tourists who are prescribed medical
marijuana abroad will soon be able to
[SPEAKER_11]: apply for permits authorizing them to
legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed
[SPEAKER_11]: or ganja as it is known locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking brilliant marketing on
behalf of the government to save 15 bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can fill your prescription
while you're- I don't have to bring it
[SPEAKER_10]: with me on the boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can buy it while I'm there, not bring it
back on your boat.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's going to be- Reggae cruise.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reggae cruise.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody saw my Instagram
and Facebook post about reggae cruise,
[SPEAKER_11]: but in November, I think there's the
biggest cruise with like 20 of my favorite
[SPEAKER_11]: reggae artists.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to Jamaica and it's
going to be even more fun now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: On Wednesday, Colorado based United
Cannabis Corp said it has launched a
[SPEAKER_11]: partnership with Jamaican agencies to
launch a marijuana research and
[SPEAKER_11]: development facility on the island that
they hope will lead patents and medical
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peter Bunting, the island's national
security minister said the legislation
[SPEAKER_11]: does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its
stance on transnational drug trafficking
[SPEAKER_11]: or cultivation of illegal plots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaica has long been considered the
Caribbean's largest supplier of pot to the
[SPEAKER_11]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: and regional islands.
[SPEAKER_11]: The passage of this legislation does not
create a free-for-all in the growing,
[SPEAKER_11]: transporting, dealing or exporting of
ganja.
[SPEAKER_11]: Security forces will continue to
rigorously enforce Jamaican law with our
[SPEAKER_11]: international treaty obligations,
Bunting said in parliament.
[SPEAKER_11]: William Brownfield, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: assistant secretary for counter narcotics
affairs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, I'm glad that's not my job.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm William Brownfield, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: assistant secretary for counter narcotics
affairs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this dude told the Associated Press
days before the vote that Jamaican law is
[SPEAKER_11]: of course Jamaica's own business and
Jamaica's sovereign decision.
[SPEAKER_11]: But he noted that the trafficking of
marijuana into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: remains against the law.
[SPEAKER_11]: We expect that Jamaica and all states
party to the U.N.
[SPEAKER_11]: drug conventions will uphold their
obligations, including a firm commitment
[SPEAKER_11]: to combating and dismantling criminal
organizations involved in drug
[SPEAKER_11]: trafficking, he told AP in an email.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, you guys, how do we stop
illegal cannabis trafficking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only answer that makes any sense
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: What we need to do is buy a small plane at
first, and then we fly people straight
[SPEAKER_10]: from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: To Jamaica for a trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have to stop somewhere in
the middle of Florida.
[SPEAKER_11]: The smaller the plane, the more frequently
it stops.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you now, if it's going to be
anywhere, it's Georgia.
[SPEAKER_10]: And oh my God, please no.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to keep reading before Adam
crashes a plane in a fantasy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying anybody's got the money from
Colorado to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why there's a weed legal in both?
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, debate has long raged in
Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting
[SPEAKER_11]: ganja, but previous calls to decriminalize
small amounts of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fizzled out because officials feared it
would bring sanctions from Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaican officials now have high hopes
that the island can become a player in the
[SPEAKER_11]: Nascan medical marijuana industry,
health tourism, and the development of
[SPEAKER_11]: innovative pot derived items.
[SPEAKER_11]: Local scientists already have a history of
creating marijuana derived products,
[SPEAKER_11]: such as Canisal, which helps relieve
pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that they say local scientists in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some dude with dreadlocks
sitting on a five gallon bucket making
[SPEAKER_11]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've seen quite a few people that
are moving down that way as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of popular people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you have to.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of our friends went on a trip there
just recently.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of our friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was a couple of months back,
but as soon as this happened, when it was
[SPEAKER_11]: like coming up, they went there and helped
them put this shit in place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been watching lots of YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the people from Steep Hill,
like Addie Wynn.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Addison DeMorrow.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up brother?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think quite a few are from up there in
Denver River Rock area and stuff like
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, where were I?
[SPEAKER_11]: Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton said the
cannabis industry holds great potential
[SPEAKER_11]: for Jamaica where marijuana has long been
grown illegally on mountainsides and
[SPEAKER_11]: marshes.
[SPEAKER_11]: The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an
international trend of easing restrictions
[SPEAKER_11]: on marijuana for medical or personal use.
[SPEAKER_11]: More than 20 US states allow some form of
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: And last year, Colorado and Washington
legalized personal use.
[SPEAKER_11]: On Tuesday, Alaska became the third US
state to legalize the recreational use of
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana for adults.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the Americas, Uruguay last year became
the first nation to create a legal
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Argentina, personal possession of
marijuana was decriminalized under a 2009
[SPEAKER_11]: Supreme Court ruling that jail time for
small amounts of drugs violates the
[SPEAKER_11]: country's constitution.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Chile permits use of medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Details of Jamaica's licensing authority
and its hope for medical marijuana sector
[SPEAKER_11]: will need to be refined in upcoming
months.
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, Jamaican cannabis crusaders
applauded the amendments.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a big step in the right direction,
but there's still a lot of work to do,
[SPEAKER_11]: said Delano Saivarite, Director of the
Cannabis Commercial and Medical Task
[SPEAKER_11]: Force.
[SPEAKER_11]: So big up to Jamaica, taking steps in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: So much more traveling and tourism is
going to happen there because people can
[SPEAKER_11]: go there and get your medical marijuana
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if they charge everybody like even
five bucks, to 15 bucks or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to legally consume without not
have to worry about it while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: there, that's going to be millions for the
government just off taxes along the
screen.
[SPEAKER_10]: California is like the only warm place
that it's semi-legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like all those places- Oh man,
Pueblo in the summer, we get 300 days of
[SPEAKER_11]: sunshine here, bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, but it's hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it does get pretty damn warm here,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, being closer to the equator,
I'm sure it's hot, but that beach sure
[SPEAKER_10]: does help.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Jamaica would be dope.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know when it goes into effect,
but I want to go visit now and go take
[SPEAKER_11]: some dabs in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure they're down there already.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a couple of more things that I
want to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was enough news, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the ladybug thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, somebody sent me an email about
fermentation and your fermentation
[SPEAKER_11]: methods.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to address that, but I'm wanting
to do it when Sean's here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sean is the guy to talk to about
fermentations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got to do some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give a big shout out to
Vigorlover.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hashtag mids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's mids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Linz, happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday, girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: James Holt, dude, you sent me a compliment
on Facebook and I told you, thanks for
[SPEAKER_11]: listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he didn't seem to take me seriously.
[SPEAKER_11]: He seemed like I was kind of dicking you
around, but no, I was fucking not
[SPEAKER_11]: condescending at all when I said that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I meant all of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I hope you listened to this and I
hope you took me seriously because you're
[SPEAKER_11]: one of the most bad-ass professional
guitar players.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even saying you're a professional.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a demeanor the way you do shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a professional.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for you to compliment me like that
just meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wasn't even being a prick about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was fucking totally serious,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That blew my mind that you listened and
that you complimented me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also a big shout out to Michael.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's moving back to West Carolina or Ohio
to get a real job and handle business.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to miss you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was cool having you around here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like talking about glass with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Peace, buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a lot of Mikes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Colorado bearded dabbers, Michael.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's moving back home.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got to take care of some things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to miss you, bro,
but I'm sure I'll see you again,
[SPEAKER_11]: man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have to hang up the beard.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a dab dab world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, he trimmed up the beard.
[SPEAKER_11]: He looks good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys for listening to the one
year episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, you guys, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: I call these guys like a half hour ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, you want to come over and do a
podcast?
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're like, yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's dropping dimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my ring.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're pulling off your wedding ring while
you're on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: We going out after this or what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, there will be a growers meeting
April 26th at Hydro indoor growing

[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait for that guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be hanging out at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope to see everybody there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody there.

[SPEAKER_11]: I want to cover, um, Jesse, Jesse shout

[SPEAKER_10]: And Jesse grows for sure.

[SPEAKER_10]: No grows.
Ooh.

Kuno grows.

wants to just be like, great show,
[SPEAKER_11]: but you know, like the last comment was
really great.
[SPEAKER_11]: The dude was writing the, did I read the
fucking reading that from his cubicle
[SPEAKER_11]: while he's at work while he's at work in
his cubicle.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you're taking notes from pot plants
and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss, I know I don't miss having a
cubicle job.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did that once.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of have a cubicle job.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a much more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_11]: My cubicle is awesome.

[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to waste time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on the fritz.

spent probably three hours to find out

[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, dude, it made the most painful sound
in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like we've been here before.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to need to put some duct tape
or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just move this over to here and we'll
try to prevent that because, dude,
[SPEAKER_11]: that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, dude, I've heard the noise,
but neither me nor Mike heard it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was laying right across my input right
here, just right across there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I looked and I was like, it was just
going in my ears.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I felt like it was happening in my
body.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could feel it through my spine and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, welcome to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuff about cannabis and shit's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have a laugh.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be a Wednesday episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woohoo, Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday for life.
[SPEAKER_11]: That song I started to play before I had a
crazy great technical issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was from the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_11]: I owe them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm way off rhythm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's read a podcast ad and we will get
into the show here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike, don't spit that Mountain Dew on the
computer, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to ruin everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to ruin it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes another fun sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heads up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know what he was going to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just taking a big ass chug of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mountain Dew number two.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to take it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Open it on the mic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Hygro.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a store in Pueblo called Hygro and
their growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have great prices on growing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well-organized shelves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well-organized shelves and a couple of
beautiful clerks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what they're called.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're sales associates.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jesse is included in that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Adam helps load the truck sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's beautiful as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Hygro and their growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hygro and their growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in Denver, go to the Denver
location.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 6271 Beach Street.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in Pueblo, check them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: No bullshit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't represent a company on my
podcast that I didn't love with my heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hygro is my friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got a great, great store.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you tell them you're listening to the
podcast, they'll give you a Fatty Bobatty
[SPEAKER_11]: discount.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will give you commercial pricing on
your entire order.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's fat.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll save you money.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did I just open?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this Gorilla Glue?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're about to take some Gorilla Glue,
dads.
[SPEAKER_11]: But before I do that, I got to read this
next one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, big, huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much love to our friends at the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said before, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I only rep companies that I really love on
the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I use the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got worm castings.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got sea crop.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have got fish hydrosolates.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you ask, they'll probably give you a
tour of the worm farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see how the worms are made.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 411 Tijuana Street in Colorado
Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't want to travel or if you're
out of state, they will mail you worm
[SPEAKER_11]: castings.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will mail you Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: They will ship to your front door.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you can get live worms or worm...
I forgot what they're called.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, the baby worms.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have the website pulled up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have been more prepared.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll mail that shit to your door and
you can use all the shit that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike, dude, we're going to have to teach
you about microphone stands.
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot fight with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is your friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's keeping that red thing in your face
where we need it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be that microphone stands friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get a Zen moment with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys, go to
rockymountainwormcompany.com and they will
[SPEAKER_11]: mail you cool shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to pay for it, but they'll mail
you cool shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of love to Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really hard to rob places through the
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially when they're sending you poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you get in the mail, Jimmy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Box of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old box of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping on this shit was insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: Straight from the Rocking Mountains.
[SPEAKER_10]: The best shit on the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone I know that's grown right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys want to sponsor the show,
I do do way better ads on Monday episodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a Wednesday episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting a little funky today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had an equipment error right at the
beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a chaotic episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go just 30 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to sponsor the show,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get you all that information.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get you all squared up.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've got a product you want me to
test out, we like testing out new shit on
[SPEAKER_11]: the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need an official email of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have an official email of the show?
[SPEAKER_11]: This one was a gift and a hookup from my
good friend Giddy at Emotec.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to the G-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be real specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike needs an email?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: White Mike himself needs an email.
[SPEAKER_10]: You would never leave the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: You would have no reason to come over here
anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will come over here to get shattered.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seriously been considering an
inverter for my car for the email.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw that online and I cringed a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised you don't have one.
Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I have a passenger that can hold onto
it so nobody gets burned, it'll be
[SPEAKER_11]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you put it in the cup holder,
your elbow is going to hit that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have a ring right there
and you're going to need some apothecant
[SPEAKER_11]: of pain cream to rub on that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be on the news as the
first car fire from an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I think about the lady who hit
autopilot in the RV.
[SPEAKER_11]: Walked into the back of the RV and started
taking dabs all at the same time on the
[SPEAKER_11]: highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a matter of time before some
fucking dabbed out moron bursts into
[SPEAKER_00]: flames sitting in a parking lot somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be that one guy that ruins
it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, until that happens, don't be that
guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody got my gutter reference,
you get a high five.
[SPEAKER_11]: TCU, baby, for life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man, nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Gorilla Glue, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't sponsor the show or anything,
but I got some tasty Turpex Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_11]: shatter from Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_11]: They sponsor my happiness.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: This smile has been brought to you by our
good friends at Turpex and Green and
[SPEAKER_11]: Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was well put, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Hunt and his womb room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, get that meat wallet tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, you guys are pulling out all the
stops.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a lot of hashtags.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be a hell of a chaotic
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some order to the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got three news articles.
[SPEAKER_11]: All we have to do is get through three
news articles and then we can have fun,
[SPEAKER_11]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do one right off the bat
while I choke on this giant dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just took a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably time to get to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I read commercials and such.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get down to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a click.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing the clickety clicks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for the cough in the mic,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am more professional than that most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely has that glue taste.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That Gorilla Glue dab tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Mike, when you set that down,
make sure you- Don't cross the strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put that right on my cable here so that I
can go deaf for another 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the funniest shit I've seen
in weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell if he was having a
seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get up and walk away.
[SPEAKER_11]: My body told me, get up, walk away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just take off your headphones and walk
away from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I feel when you're over there
heating it up and scraping the e-mail.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you clean the top.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You seem to save that shit for when I come
over and it's like, oh, he loves this
[SPEAKER_10]: shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Adam's favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I could- I don't even want to do it
in the microphone.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you don't want to do it here.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody and half the people on the
planet will have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to read a news article.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, one surprising downside of
marijuana legalization, major energy use.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's a picture of,
we got three, two, five, no, like seven or
[SPEAKER_11]: eight lights hanging in a little grow
facility here with the ballast up on the
[SPEAKER_11]: ceiling just to kind of show you a nice
little visual of electricity being ran.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it says, oh, this article,
I better give some credit here,
[SPEAKER_11]: who Chris Mooney from the Washington Post
wrote this.
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, across the country, there's a
growing trend toward the legalization of
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Four states, Oregon, Washington,
Colorado, Alaska have voted to allow
[SPEAKER_11]: people to possess limited amounts of
marijuana for personal use and also to let
[SPEAKER_11]: producers apply for licenses to produce
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_11]: DC also just voted to allow personal
possession.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of this on top of the 23 states that
allow it for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_11]: In some states, we just read two different
articles that gave me different numbers on
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't we once said 21, said 23?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe they were taking it different
times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're dabbing also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way this gets counted up is confusing
because there's, since that second Sanjay
[SPEAKER_00]: Gupta special, there's been a whole bunch
of CBD only states across the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudo medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you count that, if you count that,
like the number's a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 25 now.
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy that was making the big fuss in
New Jersey was just in the news today
[SPEAKER_10]: wanting to go back at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, oh, blood money.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do I keep this article going?
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris Christie being all fat and crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be just a meme.
[SPEAKER_10]: He used to be the governor of Florida too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, like I've, or his brother or
something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he's just another man who ain't never
going to be president.
[SPEAKER_11]: Order in the court.
[SPEAKER_11]: In some states where businesses are also
now legally cultivating and producing
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana, a mainstream industry is
emerging.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marijuana sales totaled $700 million in
Colorado last year for instance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: How much of that did you spend?
[SPEAKER_10]: The first three months that I was here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I bought legal pot last
year, it was on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can pull that photo up and get exact
60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: About 125 on the first at the greener side
dispensary, but I've bought a lot of this
[SPEAKER_11]: shatter from green and healthy lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 is going to be a different tale.
[SPEAKER_11]: But these donuts is a hard thing to let
go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got all this black cherry Kim done.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran a lot of black cherry Kim and it is
tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little heavy on the indica side.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for daytime, it's a little bit much
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't glob out.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's see, $700 million in Colorado
last year for instance, but there's a
[SPEAKER_11]: surprising catch.
[SPEAKER_11]: It turns out that indoor marijuana growth
in particular, a cultivation method often
[SPEAKER_11]: favored in the industry for many reasons,
uses a surprising amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_11]: The level of power use appears to be so
significant that one scholar is now
[SPEAKER_11]: suggesting that as the industry grows,
states and localities should take
[SPEAKER_11]: advantage of marijuana licensing
procedures to also regulate the industry's
[SPEAKER_11]: use, energy use, and greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn hippie.
[SPEAKER_11]: Given that this new industry, let's see,
given that this is a new industry that is
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be pretty highly regulated,
I felt like the state and local
[SPEAKER_11]: policymakers have a unique opportunity to
incorporate energy usage and climate
[SPEAKER_11]: assessments into their state marijuana
licensing fees, says Gina Warren,
[SPEAKER_11]: a professor at the Texas A&M University
School of Law, whose paper titled,
[SPEAKER_11]: Regulating Pot to Save the Polar Bear,
Energy and Climate Impacts of the
[SPEAKER_11]: Marijuana Industry, will soon appear in
the Columbia Journal of Environmental
[SPEAKER_11]: Laws.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sentence was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did anybody else catch that?
[SPEAKER_10]: You said pot and polar bears in the same
sentence.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made some interesting pictures for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just saw a polar bear like running
through a field of pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought that that was like an
obstacle of a sentence to get through.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were eight punctuation marks in that
statement there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That whole paragraph was one sentence.
[SPEAKER_11]: That entire paragraph is one sentence.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a comma, a comma, a comma.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wrote it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_11]: An ellipse and then another comma.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a period.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much punctuation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good writing and props.
[SPEAKER_11]: The published statistics on energy use
from indoor marijuana production will blow
[SPEAKER_11]: your mind whether or not you use this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: In a 2012 study of carbon footprint of
indoor cannabis production published in
[SPEAKER_11]: the Journal Energy Policy, researcher Evan
Mills noted that on occasion, previous
[SPEAKER_11]: unrecognized spheres of energy used to
come to light and marijuana is a textbook
[SPEAKER_11]: example.
[SPEAKER_11]: The study estimated that indoor cannabis,
both legal and illegal, uses $6 billion
[SPEAKER_11]: worth of electricity every year,
amounting to 1% of overall U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in some production intensive states
like California, it was much higher,
[SPEAKER_11]: 3% Mills found.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't read into this article much
further, but I'm going to assume that
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado is going to hit like 5% of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're killing it on the indoor
grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing that would hold Colorado
back from that would be there is less
[SPEAKER_10]: people here than something like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the percentage of our overall
usage.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one average kilogram of final product
is associated with 4,600 kilograms of
[SPEAKER_11]: carbon dioxide emissions to the
atmosphere, or that of 3 million average U
[SPEAKER_11]: .S.
[SPEAKER_11]: cars when aggregated across all national
production roadmills.
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason is simply the technology
required.
[SPEAKER_11]: Specific energy uses include high
intensity lighting, dehumidification to
[SPEAKER_11]: remove water vapor and avoid mold
formation, space heating or cooling during
[SPEAKER_11]: non-illuminated periods, and drying,
preheating of irrigation water,
[SPEAKER_11]: generation of carbon dioxide by burning
fossil fuel and ventilation and air
[SPEAKER_11]: conditioning to remove waste heat,
writes Mills.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a well-researched argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did all that math and they haven't
figured out how much carbon dioxide the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sucked back out the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, but there's another side of that
coin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Depends on how many plants you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree with this article fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying there's like, there's a
little bit of subtraction that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done before we freak out a little.
[SPEAKER_11]: True that.
[SPEAKER_11]: She keeps on going and she says,
Uh-oh, where did I go?
[SPEAKER_11]: Outdoor production also has environmental
consequences.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has been charged with deforestation and
high levels of water and pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_11]: But as pot becomes more legal and
mainstream, notes Warren, outdoor
[SPEAKER_11]: producers will have to abide by
pre-existing environmental laws just like
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_11]: In effect, that makes indoor production
the chief climate change and energy
[SPEAKER_11]: concern, according to Warren's article.
[SPEAKER_11]: While underground indoor marijuana
production already consumed plenty of
[SPEAKER_11]: energy, legalization will increase energy
use even further.
[SPEAKER_11]: As the industry grows, so will its
negative externalities, she writes,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is why she's proposing that all
states that legalize marijuana use should
[SPEAKER_11]: also require the growing industry to power
itself cleanly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not without precedent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting in October of this year,
Boulder County and Colorado will require
[SPEAKER_11]: many facilities to directly offset 100% of
electricity, propane, and natural gas
[SPEAKER_11]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through renewables or other means.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Warren says she's not picking on the
marijuana industry with her proposals.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that, well, we don't often have
new industries appear that use a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: energy and are likely to be highly
regulated as they become legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it could actually be a marketing
tool for the industry, says Warren,
[SPEAKER_11]: because if you have people who are
purchasing the product, who are the type
[SPEAKER_11]: of individual who cares about the
environment, then they would gravitate
[SPEAKER_11]: toward the green marijuana production.
[SPEAKER_11]: What she's saying makes sense because we
are sucking up a lot of power and I've
[SPEAKER_11]: thought about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe somebody can send me an email or
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I want to do, I consider myself
a pro grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could grow, you can give me a plant
that's half dead and in 90 days I'll give
[SPEAKER_11]: you some tasty ass buds out of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can overcome most problems in a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I want some guidance on how to lessen
my carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recycle my soil, but still I have to run
lights for 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there other things we can do to kind
of lessen our carbon footprint?
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys know, send me ideas.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can tweet them to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can email me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Facebook.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I want to see, I want to know how I
can save some money.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an argument right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you would try to find those
cannabis cultivators would start looking
[SPEAKER_10]: for places like wine, you know,
places.
[SPEAKER_10]: They would right next to rivers where they
can have a water mill or- I'm just talking
[SPEAKER_11]: about like my preexisting indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people that have a home grow or a
small warehouse grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I want to find out ways that people
like us, like you, you've got a trap house
[SPEAKER_11]: grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see a way that you can kind of
make lessen your electricity bill.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just save you however much it is,
maybe cut 10% of that off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you could definitely do that with
solar.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you're just cutting out the a hundred
dollars that it takes to run your house
[SPEAKER_10]: would be a hundred dollars less over a
year.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would add up you know, tremendously.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 15 to, you know, quite a bit of a
hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just watched you try to do math.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like right now, right now it's
$1,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying like, you know- The
local application of this is the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo just required everybody grow
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow outside in any fashion this
year in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully in a year we'll have greenhouse
rules done here, but they cut it all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not until the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're talking about large scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not even small person by six persons
in my own backyard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a city municipal fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what happens if you're not on the
game.
[SPEAKER_11]: The sun is not- They're looking for more
illegal Pagros here now more than they
[SPEAKER_11]: were before we had legalized cannabis to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause now they want to regulate the shit
out of it before they didn't have time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to read.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one do we want to do?
[SPEAKER_11]: This one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to do the- which one?
[SPEAKER_11]: The good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're both good, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to read the one written by-
They're both written by the same person.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Kristen Wyatt actually is writing a
lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to do the one about racism and
drop in Colorado pot arrests?
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I fucking love that story.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's read this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when you legalize pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the things.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says the legalization of marijuana in
Colorado hasn't solved the racial
[SPEAKER_11]: disparities in enforcement that drug
policy reformers had hoped to end with
[SPEAKER_11]: blacks still far more likely than whites
to be charged with pot related crimes,
[SPEAKER_11]: a new report says.
[SPEAKER_11]: The report issued Wednesday by the Parole
Legalization Drug Policy Alliance showed
[SPEAKER_11]: that marijuana arrests in Colorado all but
stopped after voters made the drug legal
[SPEAKER_11]: in small amounts for those 21 and older.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the report noted continuing racial
disparities involving the marijuana crimes
[SPEAKER_11]: that remain, including public use and
possession in excess of the ounce limit.
[SPEAKER_11]: The study examined drug arrests in all 64
Colorado counties for two years before and
[SPEAKER_11]: after legalization in 2012.
[SPEAKER_11]: The total number of charges for pot
possession, distribution, and cultivation
[SPEAKER_11]: plummeted by almost 95% from about 39,000
in 2010 to just over 2,000 last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it only takes an hour of the cop's
time, that's 37 cop hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37,000 cop hours we just reallocated to
shit that's worth something useful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can be out solving a crime.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any crime.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking for your bike that got stolen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking for something that bad happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even want to create crimes in my
head.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say it has been nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like not worrying about the bag that's in
my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: It honestly is.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only crime most marijuana
consumers ever commit other than like
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic infractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear my seatbelt and don't speed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's literally the only problem is
once you pull me over, it's like,
[SPEAKER_10]: here's the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells like weed in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just came from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, yeah, I hope it smells good in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I paid a lot of money for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, you can have my sweater.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me five minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you come back, tell me it
smells like weed in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to keep reading because we
want to get through a couple of articles.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even after legalization, blacks were more
likely, twice as likely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I read that wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blacks were more than I've stuttered
because we're saying blacks.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're saying blacks still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write this article.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to complain that we're
calling African-American people blacks.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when you know you've made it,
when you've got those one or two guys that
[SPEAKER_11]: are like, who are you calling blacks?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can send an email to Kristen White at
the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_11]: She did that, not me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I found it slightly off putting to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even after legalization, African-American
folks were more than twice as likely.
[SPEAKER_11]: As likely as whites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's just oddly written.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us community, is it us or in
the dabs or is it how it's written?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we the racist one or are they?
[SPEAKER_11]: Blacks were also more, much more likely to
be charged with illegal cultivation of pot
[SPEAKER_11]: or possession of more than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_11]: Legalization, I'm still off putting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We legalized pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't legalize decent policing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Legalization is no panacea for the
long-time issues that law enforcement had
[SPEAKER_11]: with the black and brown community,
said Art Way, Colorado director for the
[SPEAKER_11]: Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Still the drop-off in overall arrest is
good news for minorities, said Tony
[SPEAKER_11]: Newman, also of the Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite the uprising racial disparities,
the massive drops in arrests have been
[SPEAKER_11]: enormously beneficial to people of color,
Newman said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this racist?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I think about it, the more I
think we stop referring to people by the
[SPEAKER_00]: general shade of their skin, like fucking
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the term that I related to in
there?
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't think of it now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just based on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Already passed you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the minority.
[SPEAKER_11]: The analysis did not break out data for
Colorado's largest ethnic minority,
[SPEAKER_11]: Latinos.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because data comes from the
National Incident-Based Reporting System,
[SPEAKER_11]: which does not tally numbers for Latinos.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the region's top officials for
coordinating drug enforcement,
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd Gorman of the Rocky Mountain High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program,
[SPEAKER_11]: insisted that officers are not racially
profiling pot users.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just calling them blacks and
whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a general assumption about a whole
race of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Racial disparities exist under laws.
[SPEAKER_11]: What does it mean that homicide and rape
laws are racist?
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other factors going on here that
we need to address, Gorman said.
[SPEAKER_11]: After legalization, racial disparities did
ease somewhat for marijuana distribution
[SPEAKER_11]: charges.
[SPEAKER_11]: Blacks accounted for about 22% of such
arrests in 2010 and around 18% in 2014.
[SPEAKER_11]: The arrest data got a mixed response from
the regional head of the NAACP.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did the head of the NAACP know that you
were calling them blacks when you wrote
[SPEAKER_11]: this article?
[SPEAKER_11]: The overall decrease in arrests,
charges, and cases is enormously
[SPEAKER_11]: beneficial to communities of color who
bore the brunt of marijuana prohibition,
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosemary Harris Little said in a
statement.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we are concerned with the rise in
a disparity for the charge of public
[SPEAKER_11]: consumption and challenge law enforcement
to ensure this reality is not
[SPEAKER_11]: discriminatory in any manner.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_11]: In 2014, the year Colorado's recreational
marijuana stores opened, blacks were 3.9%
[SPEAKER_11]: of the population, but accounted for 9.2%
of pot possession arrests.
[SPEAKER_11]: For illegal marijuana cultivation,
the disparities didn't just persist,
[SPEAKER_11]: they got much worse.
[SPEAKER_11]: In 2010, whites in Colorado were slightly
more likely than blacks to be arrested for
[SPEAKER_11]: growing pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: After legalization, the arrest rate for
whites dropped dramatically, but ticked up
[SPEAKER_11]: for blacks.
[SPEAKER_11]: In 2014, the arrest rate for blacks was
roughly 2.5 times higher.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot more of this article,
but I'm not going to read it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost done, but we get the point.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like the way it's written,
and I just want to abandon it to tell you
[SPEAKER_11]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of really good information
in it, but it seems like it was written
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really fast by somebody who wasn't
really thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that reporter, but yeah,
this strikes me as a little bit odd.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take a drink of this water,
and then we're going to read another
[SPEAKER_11]: article written by the same person,
and we're going to try to avenge her
death.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this racist?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, that felt really weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: And blacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just sounds so fucking rude to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did seem like something like if we were
in public, you wouldn't want to say it
[SPEAKER_00]: full-throated.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to ask you, would you say
that out loud at the mall?
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at all these blacks.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how she would state it in a
courtroom, or politics.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, let's just be real though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm no civil rights person, but I don't
even want to be called the whites over
[SPEAKER_11]: here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not the whites, and they're not the
blacks.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're fucking people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I chose minority because I got long hair,
and that means you get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're still a person.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why I was trying to hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the moral of the story is pot's
almost legally for white here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's kind of legally for black.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but the arrests are down a lot,
but it's still high for black people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay off of Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting there doing the math in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's roughly 22,000 people of color that
didn't get arrested or fucked with last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, the data is so screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to restructure most of how
we enforce the laws in this country.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, I want your opinion on that article
to people that are listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tweet me, email me.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said it earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want your opinion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tweet him, and go read it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that a racist article?
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it oddly written in a racist tone?
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't like the way that… Is it racist
to say it that way?
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't like it, so I abandoned it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to read another article.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one says, Colorado bill seeks to
standardize marijuana testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I've noticed is a lot of people in
Colorado don't trust the testing
[SPEAKER_11]: facilities anymore because we'll take a
test to one lab and it'll come out at 22%,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can take another test to another
lab and it'll come out at 29%.
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, everyone's going to start
going to the lab that gets higher tests
[SPEAKER_11]: because you want to be able to brag about
higher results.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's no real standard for the
testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can all just open our own lab pretty
much and be like, I got the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an email or a printed piece of
paper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's all you get.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a PDF on your phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you have to worry about if those
high dollar people couldn't pay more for
[SPEAKER_10]: better testing results.
Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Colorado is moving to establish
another marijuana first, the first
[SPEAKER_11]: government standards for marijuana
testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: A bill approved by its first committee in
the state legislature on Thursday would
[SPEAKER_11]: create a statewide laboratory standard for
the state's 18 pot testing labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently, the labs are certified by the
state health authorities, but they don't
[SPEAKER_11]: have uniform rules for testing pot
potency, homogeneity, and contaminants as
[SPEAKER_11]: required by state law.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lab owners say they need the standards
because different labs now produce very
[SPEAKER_11]: different results.
[SPEAKER_11]: Existing pot tests generally just look for
whether the drug is present, not how
[SPEAKER_11]: strong it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: In most industries, there are long
established processes, said Ian Berenger,
[SPEAKER_11]: owner of a pot testing lab called RM3.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, for cannabis, like most of the
industry, we're making up the rules as we
[SPEAKER_11]: go along.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad he admits that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The labs can currently be used by licensed
marijuana producers.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bill was amended to remove lab access
to private individuals and industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_11]: growers, now covered in separate bills
still pending in the legislature,
[SPEAKER_11]: which kind of bars me from getting my
cannabis tested now.
[SPEAKER_11]: The stuff that I used to grow at my
private grow for my patients, I was able
[SPEAKER_11]: to take that to the lab and get it tested
and we could see what was in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we all need access to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand why they cut us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the latest step in a dance
that's been going on for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember we didn't have testing
labs because the existing labs that had
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment and the know-how are banned
from working with cannabis because they
[SPEAKER_00]: all require FDA and federal licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to build these from the ground
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there were 18 of them in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it says a separate bill advanced
Thursday and a Senate committee would
[SPEAKER_11]: allow industrial hemp growers to use the
labs too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado currently allows farmers to grow
hemp, marijuana's non-intoxicating cousin,
[SPEAKER_11]: but only if the plants fall below a
threshold for the plants intoxicating
[SPEAKER_11]: ingredient THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an ingredient.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the farmers can take their plants
to a lab to make sure they're meeting the
[SPEAKER_11]: standard.
[SPEAKER_11]: The testing bill creates what's called a
reference library, a standard set of
[SPEAKER_11]: protocols for testing pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lab owner said the state needs to
essentially referee all the methodologies
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're using.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all understand the need to reveal the
special sauce we've been using to further
[SPEAKER_11]: the industry, Barringer said.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bill now heads to a separate committee
before consideration by the full house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Full house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to watch that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: This needs to happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to- No, this is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the beautiful parts of legalization
is it's like everything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are the regulators.
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to be regulated of all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing labs for sure need to know
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all need to be using the same
equipment, playing by the same rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start seeing reality in our
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spot bullshit on the shelf if
you're us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your flower doesn't have 40% THC,
dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to even- You clearly
keep the- There's a local shop that's
[SPEAKER_11]: claiming, there's a local shop that claims
they have a 30% strain and I've seen it
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's mids.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not 30%.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely not 30%.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know about the national strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember the guy that was all hyped
up about his 29% apple pie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the apple pie strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both took one look at it and we both
look at him and we both looked at us and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, we tried not to giggle.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all saw each other's poker face right
then, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows when you shit the bed and
you can spot it on these labs instead of-
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the rough trait to have,
just saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: With these testing labs, if we get them
all standardized and regulated,
[SPEAKER_11]: then we won't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're like, this hash was tested super
clean and super high in potency.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, well, where'd you get it done?
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get it at the place that you pay a
lot more and they just give you really
[SPEAKER_11]: high results?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a mall.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, or did you go to the place that's
reputable?
[SPEAKER_11]: If you got to test it at Steep Hill,
I trust you, but I don't know any of the
[SPEAKER_11]: other places.
[SPEAKER_11]: Steep Hill gave me a tour of their
facility and showed me what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: They blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the other places, you just give them a
sample and they drive away.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can send you an email later.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're 100% cannabis too, correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's all they test.
[SPEAKER_10]: What about your edibles and your labs?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying they're not another
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, oh yeah, we got science stuff in
here.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got science, bitch.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets more and more important because
we just required that all edible dosing be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys remember how that first
regulatory check went through?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was like episode six,
I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a long time ago we talked about
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were edibles that were advertising,
they had a hundred milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_11]: they had zero at a peer.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick a man for some fuck up last year,
but yeah, there were a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had new rules that required
that only 10 milligrams of THC are in each
[SPEAKER_00]: easily identifiable segment, which meant
no more 450 milligram fun-sized snickers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rocky mountain medicine bar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, those things are so delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody showed me one the other day,
Maddie pulled one out of the fridge and
[SPEAKER_11]: she's like, have you had these?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the mountain medicine peanut butter
bars, 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, dude, I ate one on the podcast
and it almost floated out of the chair.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a fun night.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of which, I want this 1200
milligram challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the 2500 milligram challenge?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, if you're going to do it,
you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want me to Ralphie May,
let's do it then.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if that's the kind of night you
really want.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys don't know about the 2500
milligram challenge, you got to check out
[SPEAKER_11]: episode 59.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to work up to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't just want to drop down 2500 at
one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they put it on that last
episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't really get done for a month,
but it happened.
[SPEAKER_11]: We all live, but we're still paying it
off.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something you got to work up to
and I don't know if you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the news articles.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to talk about the growers meeting
that is coming up at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_11]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys want to be at this?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys want to come?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I made it the last one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get a lot talked about,
but the community was there.
We bonded.
[SPEAKER_11]: We definitely got red-eyed.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was definitely a red-eyed experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a bonding experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: So come on out you guys to Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies on April 26th.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it starts at six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to put together a presentation
and I will talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure about what yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got 26 days to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Start sending in your questions,
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me some emails.
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do a grow lesson, like 30 or 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll turn into an hour with questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you guys have any topics you want me
to talk about on the show or at the
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting, you can send them to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've said that a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have any shout outs you want to
do before we wrap it up, boys?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_11]: This week.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a fun hump day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a middle of the week episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hump day episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hump day, hump day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: What night is it really?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually Friday night.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Friday night.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three dudes on a Friday night recording a
podcast in my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys can't hear it, but there's a big,
huge party raging behind us, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just three guys sitting in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three dudes in my kitchen taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: With water.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Mike's got Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's living it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a root beer, but it's empty now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You had caffeine-free root beer.
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't count as caffeine.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might as well be flavored water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's sugary water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: With bubbles in it to take the dab mouth
away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike's the only one here living it
hardcore.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to close the show because we're
just getting ridonkulous now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, thanks for listening to another
episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be back Monday for sure with a solid
episode for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put together a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget to check out the sponsors,

[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget about the donation button.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you click on the grow from your
heart podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you click on that donation button,
and then you type in- That's two clicks.
[SPEAKER_11]: One million dollars.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you hit donate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then- Because it's grown from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pay a whole bunch of fucking taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll throw the hugest dab party
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time for another dab, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do that right after the
show ends here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll play some outro music and we'll take
dabs while it goes on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, I'll never charge you for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm talking about a donation page.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm never going to charge you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's there if you want to end up the page.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a cause in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: A cause.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to end soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't want to keep advertising it
because the deadline for that,
[SPEAKER_11]: for donations for that may end by the time
this episode goes up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want to say that I'm giving it
to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is a good cause.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a good cause.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two donations of a hundred, two donations
totaling a hundred dollars will go to the
[SPEAKER_11]: cause I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The donate button doesn't go to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first cause, it either ends April 1st
or May 1st, but we are collecting money
[SPEAKER_11]: for my daughter to go on an educational
adventure in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a bright kid.
[SPEAKER_11]: She deserves this trip quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Only like 30 kids in the whole nation were
qualified to go on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: To be able to do that for real.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm obviously, well, my phone just reset
and I have a note on there I was going to
[SPEAKER_11]: read at the end of the show and there goes
that idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, so that's where the funding is
going.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to my kiddo.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to get her to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to cost like four or 5,000
bucks for this trip.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I read genetics is a small
business and I can't just pull that out of
[SPEAKER_11]: my ass to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other things that require,
they're required like a plane ticket also.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just like the class itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't drive to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe if you have ever driven to Hawaii,
we want you on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, hit that PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to, we'll have to find
another worthy cause for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll, I need some new microphone covers
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: These things are getting a little funky.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been spitting into these for a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a couple of adapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been kind of abusive with the show
on the go.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of these headphone jacks so that it'll
quit making that terminator sound.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, as we're on all the social media
sites, search for me, find me,
[SPEAKER_11]: follow me, be my friend.
