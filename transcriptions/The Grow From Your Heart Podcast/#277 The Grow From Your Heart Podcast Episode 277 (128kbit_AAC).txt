education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast

Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Mike, are you all right over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just gave Mike a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mike gave himself a dab and he's a
purple, pink, yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tried to lean into the mic and say
some shit and all that came out was I hit
[SPEAKER_02]: the right spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dab hit the right spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it hit you in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not abusing Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Mike got beat up by a dab
just now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you good, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we leave your mic on or do you want
me to turn it back off for a minute?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off by since Mike just took
a big dab and is talking, welcome to the
[SPEAKER_02]: show, Mike.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to challenge you right after you
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the brains and lungs are
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't feel like the lungs were going
to make it through all of that sentence,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they made it.
I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made it.

Thursday because Thursday I think is 278.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I pay attention to the numbers
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy bonus episode, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good week when we got two
episodes of The Grill From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be through the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be three because we got the

[SPEAKER_02]: bonus white Mike episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, big shout out to everybody that just

[SPEAKER_02]: Check us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can interact with the Instagram live

[SPEAKER_02]: podcast material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good questions today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask some questions, leave some comments
and interact with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually like to start the podcast off by
telling you guys what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, what did you just take a dab over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some footloose from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some footloose batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's thinking about ways to describe it
and wonderful is all he's fucking got for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice body high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot of head high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't want to get too jumbled for this
week's show, but can't go with no hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot go with no hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that kind of show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a big old fat dab of Glucinda,
which is Gorilla Glue number four with
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucinda Williams.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's batter from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say batter, it's kind of like,
it's like you took off a little piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: cream cheese or cheesecake and just cut a
little bit of piece of that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to smoke the high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_02]: crystals, but it's hard to get them to
stay on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I roll some of the, I just take the dab
of the Glucinda and just gently roll it
[SPEAKER_02]: across the Sour Joker high cannabinoid
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it picks up a few crystals for me and
take a big dab of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was like, do you want another dab
before the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I think I'm fucking
good for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't need another dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary for the quality concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also got some, this is called Vishnu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I picked this up out at Stem Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took it out of the original container
and put it in this container for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked if it was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to send you out in a child proof
container and the other container was not
[SPEAKER_02]: child proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got this one instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it says on here, the name of the
company CRX, some CRX shatter,
[SPEAKER_02]: some Vishnu.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked it up over at doctor's orders at
Stem Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friends out there doing
good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you looked like you were going to
say something and you just changed your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, I'm not going to say
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered your social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, ladies and gentlemen, if you pay any
attention to the world, we're probably a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit late, but let's talk a little
bit about the announcement that was made
[SPEAKER_02]: by Mr. Jeff Sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's the point of the bonus
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks is a special show focused around
this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you follow cannabis news at all,
you definitely heard the news that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, our attorney general, Jeff Sessions
has rescinded, uh, the coal memo,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gave some legal protection to
recreational cannabis businesses in states
[SPEAKER_01]: that have legalized recreational use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've said a lot of things in just a
couple of sentences.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a list of kind of things that we
need to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you briefly explain to us the coal
memo, because this all stems from the coal
[SPEAKER_02]: memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, when Obama took office,
there w there was no federal guidance on
[SPEAKER_01]: state medical marijuana or recreational
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we were just sort of operating in the
face of federal law and waiting to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, two pieces of legislation have evolved
since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of which is the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, coal was, uh, attorney general for a
while under Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote a memo basically to all of
his federal attorney general prosecutors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like 93 or a hundred of
them or something around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U S saying, if you operate,
um, in a district that covers a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana state, here are some guidelines
for federal enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bother wasting money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the business is following state law
instead focus on, um, diversion out of
[SPEAKER_01]: state diversion to minors, um,
shenanigans with banking rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were eight points to the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull this up if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but basically it's the, the thin
little paper shield, the legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has been using to really thrive
coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was the federal document,
the industry would look to and point to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, we're doing the best we can,
trying to comply with what the feds want
[SPEAKER_01]: to see out of legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's what states that have passed
legal marijuana, um, have used to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: guide their own rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's part of the reason Colorado right
now is really going after the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's because our legislatures have
decided that our medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: loopholes, um, are feeding that gray and
black market out of state diversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the coal memo points
that, uh, really brings down federal
[SPEAKER_01]: intervention is when stuff's going out of
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so the coal memo was, it's
literally just that it's a memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a law that was voted on or
passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not part of any official set of
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, um, an official guideline
basically for the federal enforcement of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of bosses talked and said,
Hey, that employee sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no note made or there was a note.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a note between two employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not official.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, there was a note, but not an
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, well, it went out in a very
official way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was released as how the Obama
administration would choose to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: federal resources, um, coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a limited amount of money that the
feds have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a limited number of people in
man hours and they can't go after
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody who's breaking every rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so they have to pick and choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it would be easy for states,
federal prosecutors to just round up large
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers of legal marijuana employees and
say like, look at me, they're breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: federal law, but that wouldn't be a good
use of their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're man hours, all of that effort,
money, uh, courtroom time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that could go to things like an
interstate sex trafficking ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead you went after the stores that
were following state rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a memo that said, don't
bother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is why, if you've been listening
to the show for awhile, especially leading
[SPEAKER_01]: up to last year's election, I really,
really, really pushed listeners to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved, get registered to vote,
start going to local governance meetings,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least start reading the politics
section of the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, start getting caught up on some of
this stuff because the protections that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in place for this massive legal
marijuana industry that we're building
[SPEAKER_01]: coast to coast are not set in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of them's a memo and one of them's
an amendment in a spending bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about that in a little bit,
but, uh, the coal memo was just that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just a guidance memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so we've been expecting people
like me have been expecting our attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: general, Jeff Sessions, to rescind this
for months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he hates marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most people hate cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, Jeff Sessions hates marijuana a
little bit more than most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hate cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can pull up all sorts of crazy
quotes, um, from him about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big one that's making the rounds right
now is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of his like one liners that he
said a couple of times and has really been
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up and reposted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is a bad person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, the coal memo basically said,
don't spend money on bothering cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the business is doing things
legitimately, if they're legit,
[SPEAKER_02]: let them keep doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Refocus your funds and energy on other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike decided to go with sex trafficking on
the highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No interstate, not on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, Mike, Mike wants you to
clean up the sex trafficking, which makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop busting potheads, work on
prostitution rings and child slavery and
[SPEAKER_02]: child sex trafficking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more harm than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fix that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, this basically protected the
marijuana industry, but it wasn't a rule
[SPEAKER_02]: or a law.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, Hey, let's not fuck with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's spend our money somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike says that there's more to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to, that we're going to talk
about in a minute, but that is the gist of
[SPEAKER_02]: the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sets us up to go to the next step of
what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: This asshole named Jeff Sessions gets
involved in our government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says, no more coal memo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck those weed heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't say that, but basically he came
out and gave us all a big middle finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: He uses close to terminology to that is
he's, he's allowed to, um, he,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, he really hates cannabis in
all forms, for all reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as he's concerned, this is an
evil plot, um, perpetrated with the goal
[SPEAKER_01]: of destroying America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's really invested in, um,
reversing, uh, marijuana policy coast to
[SPEAKER_01]: coast back to about 1990.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's his sweet spot in marijuana
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really wants to see that other than him
and a handful of hardcore anti-pop people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all live in the same house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this week he came out and said,
we're going to go ahead and officially
[SPEAKER_01]: rescind or cancel this memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that, uh, federal prosecutors will
now go back to following just federal law
[SPEAKER_01]: as written when it comes to the
enforcement of the controlled substances
[SPEAKER_01]: act and quote, like that was basically his
directive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, this had a lot of kind of
immediate effects, but not the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: the anti-pop crowd has been hoping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, uh, what I've got written is
what happens next.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anti-pop crowd hopes that Trump weighs
a flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: The army comes in and they kick down the
dispensary door.
[SPEAKER_02]: They arrest us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They detain us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put us in FEMA camps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come to the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They clean up the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already read a couple of posts where
they're like, why isn't the DAA arresting
[SPEAKER_01]: people yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, from that crowd and that's,
that's not at all what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were wondering if that's what's
going to happen next, that's not what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is kind of an attack or a swipe
aimed at investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, California was just about to,
or just came online on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this happened Wednesday or
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, all of the people who were waiting
to see how the rollout of California's
[SPEAKER_01]: legal marijuana business went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, before really jumping in with both
feet investment wise have now had somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: from the federal government say,
you might not want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and likely one of the immediate
repercussions of the, uh, this move by
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney general sessions is that,
um, investment in newly emerging marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: markets is going to be a lot slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for California, this is especially
kind of problematic because of how their
[SPEAKER_01]: rollout is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scheduled to progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge amounts of California have passed
bans on legal marijuana businesses until
[SPEAKER_01]: the state rolls out rules and rags and
spells out what local municipalities can
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh in on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the local area will pass their
rules and then they'll allow the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've only hit that first step yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: California said, here's what we're going
to require.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just now starting to come
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few areas in California have already
jumped on it and said, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow this from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already got play, um, licensing
protocol in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other areas have decided to wait a year or
two before they, uh, jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: rollout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those areas now are going to be
facing a very different investment market
[SPEAKER_01]: than they would otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anti pot, um, group project,
Sam, their head, Kevin's to bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is what he pushed for and why he
wanted to take some of the money support
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like that might've already
started to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't you be scared if they're like,
Hey, you're not protected anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, um, we didn't have protection that
we didn't really have protection to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and honestly folks, you guys work in
all sorts of different fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure listeners memo means memo across
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same way, like when you get a memo,
it's, it's not like an update to the
[SPEAKER_01]: official company employee handbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even it's just a memo saying like,
Hey, quit leaving your lunch in the fridge
[SPEAKER_02]: for two weeks until it rots, quit playing
nickel back in the trim room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no more naps at lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause nobody wakes up on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of that's memo worthy kind of
guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what this was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an official gov, a governmental
memo from the attorney general of the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, but it was still just a
memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the amount of protection it gave us
was really minimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was not at all permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people like me have really
continued to push the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: to get involved and really push your local
elected representatives to move our
[SPEAKER_01]: protections into something that is
permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to change federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason cannabis should be
listed as a schedule one narcotic along
[SPEAKER_01]: side heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's no reason we should have
federal prosecutors worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if this was legal, lots of things
would be better and different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, to get that change made,
we need mass support from the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's kind of the other thing
that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Monday morning, legal cannabis wasn't
under attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: This memo was in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, Jeff sessions rescinded a whole
bunch of memos, um, rolling back Obama era
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance policies on a bunch of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this wasn't included, um, which kind
of gave California a nice little shot in
[SPEAKER_01]: the arm, but, uh, it was never permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but neither was like there was no
attack going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was no sense of urgency to
rally support for, and in the couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days since this announcement's come out,
um, and that the call memo was rescinded
[SPEAKER_01]: officially, we've seen a huge amount of
galvanization across the industry from
[SPEAKER_01]: coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's been a couple of really cool
things that have happened locally,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, with legislatures from both sides of
the aisle, Republican, Democrat,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hardcore Trump voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, wait, you said state's rights,
they're jumping ship and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: they're willing to work with people,
um, across the aisle who they didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to do with on Monday morning
because this is an attack on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole lot of us have come to see is a
great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and watching everybody sort of
coalesce and come together has been really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of encouraging this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been neat watching everybody post
the fuck sessions videos or a picture of
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves session for sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has been fun to see that support
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of, I'm sure there's a
petition or three on change.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, already there are a couple of really
easy things you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed, uh, the r slash trees forum on
Reddit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the top posts immediately was a
super easy format page for figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: who your local elected representatives
are, um, in the house or the Senate,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, how to contact them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they even gave you a couple of
paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not the type of person who wants
to sit down and write a letter to your
[SPEAKER_01]: congressman, they gave you a real simple
letter saying, Hey, Jeff sessions did
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I support legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do this in this to keep those
protections in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then it's auto fills in your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a couple of different,
uh, groups that have formed to help bring
[SPEAKER_01]: out elected reps, um, and different
elected officials at all levels that are
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and most of these people who were for
five years ago, couldn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it wasn't an issue on their radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't willing to talk about it in
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're out front fighting for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, locally in Colorado, um, this
basically means nothing practically for
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, our industry is established.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sure there's plenty of companies
looking for investors to expand and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot, but for the most part we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been at work for a while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I actually wrote down that I
wouldn't be worried until that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, one rogue cop in California starts
doing raids or the DEA starts making waves
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely feel that California would be
first because they're rolling out new
[SPEAKER_02]: laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the media coverage has them in the
spotlight and they are not as well
[SPEAKER_02]: established and regulated as Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that I had actually
written down as a note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what, I mean, basically the process
for in federal enforcement would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the attorney general tells,
like his assistant attorney generals to go
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they contact local law
enforcement and start doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for Colorado, our U S attorney's
name is Bob Troyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he's covers the district of
Colorado is what they call his district.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came out like five minutes after
the news that this was getting rescinded
[SPEAKER_01]: saying this means zero change in policy
for his office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the day after this big announcement
came out, he expects no change in what he
[SPEAKER_01]: does every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, one of the things he
doesn't do is mess with legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's happy to prosecute.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody says, Hey, this legal
marijuana business is not fully playing by
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're breaking this rule or that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might take interest then, but he's
certainly not taking interest in anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: following, following the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to top it off, our state elected
attorney general, Cynthia Kaufman has come
[SPEAKER_01]: out saying, not only is her office not
interested in prosecuting marijuana crimes
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado, when it's someone who's
following the rules or illegal business
[SPEAKER_01]: following the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said she's going to fight the feds if
they come in and try to toy with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is someone who during the run up
to legalization was on board with governor
[SPEAKER_01]: Hickenlooper saying, they're not
comfortable with this decision by Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't support legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're worried about possible con,
um, consequences of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now here we are five years later,
having lived with legalization and these
[SPEAKER_01]: people are out fighting for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's one of the things we didn't
have before the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this many Americans weren't living
with dispensaries, weren't living with
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed grows, weren't living with,
I mean, shit, there's 64,000 MED bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: People across Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying every single one of them is
currently employed in the legal industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most of them are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why else have a badge?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we didn't have all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we do, um, local elected officials
who were really worried about legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: have now had five years to see that the
marijuana was always there while we've
[SPEAKER_01]: done is change where adults buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: For places like Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just teetered up that nail and it was
ready to hit, but you just brought a good
[SPEAKER_02]: thought to my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that now government,
excuse me, government and law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_02]: now that they see how many people go to
dispensaries, do you think they realize
[SPEAKER_02]: how much black market cannabis was being
bought and sold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that cracks me up
about the anti-pot community is they have
[SPEAKER_01]: no concept of what happened before
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, out of sight was really out of
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still, it was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't, but I mean, all of it was
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA puts the us buying, um,
like 60, 40 to $60 billion worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana a year back in like 99,
2004, that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like that market's gotten any
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think of that nationally and you
do the math, I was playing with these
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers at home earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you take 60 billion in sales
annually and you look at Colorado's
[SPEAKER_01]: market, we did 1.2 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in one year and it took about 64,000
of us to get that done.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do the math, that works out to
around 4 million Americans coast to coast
[SPEAKER_01]: who were involved in some level with the
illicit black market for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: 4 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, it takes a lot of people to do
$60 billion worth of business,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was all just out of sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just two guys meeting in the back
of a parking lot real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably old friends who saw each
other on the highway and stopped to say
[SPEAKER_01]: hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it doesn't look like a marijuana sale
going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When someone walks into a dispensary,
it's pretty clear that they're there to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy marijuana, or at least to check out
what legal marijuana looks like at the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no question what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more visible now, but there's
certainly not more marijuana now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never go just to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people that do though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I've got one foot in both worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know a lot of people who are
still nervous about going to visit a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary because their profession would
frown on it or something, something
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, a lot of people, people that are
paying attention, they see that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: far less people trying to sell pot locally
to their friends to make side income.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the benefit of moving all of those
sales into a legal market and no one wants
[SPEAKER_01]: to go back to what it was like before
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us growers that were growing
before so much legal legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: we joke about how it's pointless to grow
weed at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it doesn't even, there's no reason to
grow unless you're growing strictly for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you used to be a black market grower,
there's no point in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is so cheap at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different things at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many dispensaries,
but there's no need for a home black
[SPEAKER_02]: market grower anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to wait for them to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No need for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The door is open and they're pretty girls
working there to go talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go sit on some dude's
couch while he plays video games and deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with this dirty dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to sit in a parking lot and
wait for anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You walk into the store, some pretty girl
goes, Hey, and then she shows you a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of great weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to see all kinds of good jars of
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's theory before we got to see it
in practice was that the taxes that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was going to impose, we're going
to jack the price up to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: the black market could just easily
undercut the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that work for a minute is Colorado's
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerged, but at this point in time,
no one wants to deal with the hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you might be able to save a few
bucks on your ounce buying it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, your times were some,
it takes time to call, set that up,
[SPEAKER_01]: go over, hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensary weed comes with a couple of
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lot for your buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basement weed is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensary weed comes with a lab test.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lab testing includes a microbial and
yeast and contaminant test that tells you
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing funky in that herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also comes with a THC potency test that
tells you how strong that herb is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also comes with a pesticide residual
testing to tell you if there are any
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they find any problems in any of those
tests, that batch of cannabis is pulled
[SPEAKER_02]: and reexamined and reassess what can be
done with that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it can be used for concentrates,
maybe they'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes product is destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it does not pass these tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people, if you have some sort of
lung disease, I don't even know what a
[SPEAKER_02]: lung disease might be, a heart disease,
a lung disease, a throat disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: a mouth disease, an autoimmune disease,
if you're compromised in any way,
[SPEAKER_02]: that lab test means a fucking lot to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lab test is way worth the extra tax
you might pay at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get lab testing, you get product
consistency, you get a selection and a
[SPEAKER_01]: level of service that's just not possible
with the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The person inside the dispensary with the
gun is a security guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked him to be there with a gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever else you're going to get your
herb, I don't know who's got a gun there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's substantially safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market comes with a number of
really nasty necessities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every decision made in the black market is
based on economics, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the black market produce the
product, wherever it's economical to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who handles the product, whoever it's
economical to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who sells it, whoever it's economical to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who does the ID checks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who pays taxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When product molds out or gets coded in
PM, there's all sorts of stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: super commonplace in the black market to
maintain the highest profit ratio possible
[SPEAKER_01]: on any product that's produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the legal market, marijuana's grown
inappropriately zoned parcels of land by
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have passed background checks
before they're even allowed to apply for
[SPEAKER_01]: the jobs in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a Department of Agriculture
inspection and the lady was impressed with
[SPEAKER_02]: my knowledge in the Department of
Agriculture rules in our medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught the Department of Agriculture
lady a few things and she was quite
[SPEAKER_02]: impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out my certification that I've
gotten never expires.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the highest thing you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically took the class that the
people that work at the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture take before they go to
inspections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really cool little discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that come with
legalization that one by one have slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: won over huge chunks of the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry folks, I thought I turned that
ringer off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you turned it back on when you
thought you turned it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just lab testing and where the
product's grown or who gets to sell it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but voters finally get a say in all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's is legal and pervasive of a
marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It exists anywhere on the planet and
there's still a majority of the state
[SPEAKER_01]: who's banned our businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are starting to rethink that
decision because they've seen Pueblo and
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinidad and a couple of other places that
have been economic punchlines around
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado for decades really start to
thrive again because we allow this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brought a new wave of investment to
Southern Colorado and really got us back
[SPEAKER_01]: on our feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really changed around here in the
past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big anti-pop people put out a
list of talking points to all of his
[SPEAKER_01]: little disciples and one of them is in
Colorado they can't even find construction
[SPEAKER_01]: workers to pass a drug test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always laugh when I see that because
it's wall slightly true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know a lot about the company
they're talking about and the reason that
[SPEAKER_01]: company has trouble finding employees is
because they pay their people shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: have for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always had trouble maintaining an
employment force, but right now Colorado's
[SPEAKER_01]: workforce we've got like 2%, 2.9% or 3%
unemployment across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as low as it's been in forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only people still looking for a job
the biggest fuck-ups you ever met or they
[SPEAKER_01]: just relocated or they just lost their job
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them weren't planning for it
because right now most people are happily
[SPEAKER_01]: gainfully employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: These numbers are as low as they've been
since I've lived here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like every business you go to
around here you could be high working at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the business around here will
require a drug test.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you drive that way and that way it's
car dealerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those mechanics and techs I bet you
they get a P test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for sure, but you would
assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Ford.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you Ford piss tests their techs and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rule of thumb is the bigger the
company the more likely it is to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: because they get huge insurance discounts
for doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got AT&T downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know damn well they P test you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they think you're doing something
stupid it's in your contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could P test you whenever they want
and they've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several of the jobs I had before what I do
now drug test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike this got super random.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a lot of talking points written
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that you get
everything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything you need to to loop
around on that paper because I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the devs folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put this back on the tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of really cool things
that have happened since AG sessions
[SPEAKER_01]: rescinded the Cole memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those things was in Pueblo Colorado
we've got a county commissioner named Sal
[SPEAKER_01]: Pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Sal when he was very on the
fence about legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana rules were just starting
to be thought about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in like 2007, 8, 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was not at all comfortable with legal
marijuana, medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of elected officials at the
time he was raised on anti marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda and we've slowly seen him
emerge and actually become the face of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation for a lot of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people think marijuana rules in
Colorado government and politics a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times Sal is who they think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pueblo County commissioners were sort
of the first set of small government
[SPEAKER_01]: people to really get into rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember this guy when he was against
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really fun to see how much he's
evolved mainly just having to see it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember begging him to go check
out a dispensary for the first time along
[SPEAKER_01]: with his fellow commissioners and him just
shaking his head at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Friday after this news broke Sal
arranged a conference call with a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: elected officials from all across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: in legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of getting everybody galvanized and
on the same page to fight this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love seeing stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a couple of those
incidents in the last two or three days
[SPEAKER_01]: where honestly folks if you follow the
press on this you're going to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome week this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other really cool things that
happened is the very next day Vermont
[SPEAKER_01]: their state house is discussing
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Vermont might be I think the
first if not the first one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: states to pass legal marijuana
recreational adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: No medical card needed legalization by
vote of elected representatives in state
[SPEAKER_01]: government rather than by a vote of the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just average voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: The House voted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their their House of Representatives
voted to approve homegrown and legal
[SPEAKER_01]: possession limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's two plants and flower in an
ounce possession limit if I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did that the day after or the day
of this announcement they voted after the
[SPEAKER_01]: news this news came out and they voted in
favor of legalization which I thought was
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that that's still happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a done deal in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their Senate still needs to vote in favor
and then their governor would need to sign
[SPEAKER_01]: that into law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of the both of their Senate and the
governor have mentioned or come out in
[SPEAKER_01]: favor of this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's a dial back version of one
that was debated and got very close to
[SPEAKER_01]: passage last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it looks good for Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fingers are crossed from Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got an email from a listener in Vermont
who made sure I was privy to this
[SPEAKER_02]: information and he said I'm pulling up his
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said white Mike may have hooked you up
with this knowledge already but just in
[SPEAKER_02]: case he hasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he sent me a good link to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me a good article.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for that my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure that I
mentioned that one of our friends we have
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners in Vermont dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vermont Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten emails from I have a question
for our Vermont listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the publication is called like VT
Diggler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears to be a newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be a website for people in
recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell the difference from their
online presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've been doing a lot of op eds for
and against legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me and tell me what the hell that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is it a newspaper or is it just like
an anti pot group website or what is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's it called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called VT Diggler VT Diggler.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a troll page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their logo is weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like letters inside diamonds inside
circles or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's from Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's VT Diggler is the Vermont Diggler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to apologize to the people of
Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our local anti pot cooks is started
traveling to Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some anti pot group out there is flying
her out to spread her brand of
[SPEAKER_01]: dipshittery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we let export from our
area that yeah it's not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This email also says that if all goes
according to plan this would mean all
[SPEAKER_02]: states touching New York would have some
form of decriminalization with P.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: being the exception P.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things I wanted to roll
back to is the Cole memo only gave you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what little protection it provided
provided to recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did absolutely nothing for medical and
there's substantially more medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana states than there are
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: The piece of federal legislation that
governs medical marijuana states and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is important guys to like grab a pen and a
sticky pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I've got like half a sneeze cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start sneezing I'll start ranting
about something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything on deck but I'll
pull something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's got their pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called the Rohrbacher Blumeyer
Amendment and it's amendment to the
[SPEAKER_01]: omnibus spending bill basically the
federal budget every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the document that gives protection
to medical marijuana businesses saying
[SPEAKER_01]: that feds can't spend money to target
medical marijuana businesses employees
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that are operating in accordance
with state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's substantially more protection than we
had with the Cole memo and it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: jeopardy right now also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sessions can't do dick with this on his
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is up to your elected House and
Senate members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please please please hop online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Google who is my elected
representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take you to a website where it
asks you to punch in your area code.
[SPEAKER_01]: You punch in your area code and it kicks
you right to their page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your representative is blah blah blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how you contact them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on those links follow those links.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please contact your elected
representatives and urge them to support
[SPEAKER_01]: the Rohrbacher Blumeyer Amendment to the
spending bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The protections for medical marijuana
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were just extended for a couple of
couple weeks or two months I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that window is about up when the
federal budget extension was just passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow federal news you know what I
just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't basically the federal budget
was set to expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't passed the new budget and so
they had to vote to extend the old budget
[SPEAKER_01]: and that extended these protections which
were included in the old budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until they are officially included in
the new budget and that new budget is
[SPEAKER_01]: passed by a vote of the House and the
Senate it's not official yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to urge support for both of
these from both sides of the aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call your elected officials email them
tweet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what the Rohrbacher Blumeyer
Amendment is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urge support please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need these protections.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not the guy to ask this
question but can you spell that for people
[SPEAKER_02]: so that they can get a good just enough to
get Google started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so Rohrbacher and Blumeyer are named
for the two people who wrote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the Rohrbacher FAR
Amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Rohrbacher R-O-H-R-A-B-A-C-H-E-R and
then Blumeyer is B-L-U-M-E-N-A-U-E-R I
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I jotted their names down real quick from
the press while I was furiously taking
[SPEAKER_01]: notes before this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should get you close enough in
Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you Google federal medical marijuana
protection amendment it should come up to
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of those words are a lot easier to
spell than Rohrbacher or Blumeyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these folks are probably in a
cubicle or cutting concrete or in a garden
[SPEAKER_02]: so getting them to do that right now we're
gonna have to kind of just hand it right
[SPEAKER_02]: to them or it might not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the time post?
[SPEAKER_02]: 41-52 but there will be editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright go to about 35-40 minutes and hit
play and hopefully you can get that piece
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to Google to find your local
rep and get a hold of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Play that into Siri.
Or Alexa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright Mike it looks like you got more
bullet points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just double checking my notes to make
sure that we hit everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure you get everything out
because you did a lot of homework over
[SPEAKER_02]: there for me and I want to make sure we
get it all put into the show for you I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to waste your material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you putting all that stuff
together by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been following the story really
closely.
[SPEAKER_02]: When this announcement came out I was like
we gotta honestly people were telling me
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram and on Facebook when's Mike
coming over you got to get Mike over for
[SPEAKER_02]: this episode it's time to have Mike on
what are you guys doing what's the talk
[SPEAKER_01]: with Mike and I feel bad because I had to
kick this back we're gonna do it Friday I
[SPEAKER_01]: had to push it back don't do it Saturday I
had to push it back I know exactly why so
[SPEAKER_02]: glad I got here and it involves children
and children first brother the kids first
[SPEAKER_01]: family first always yeah especially when
it's a little ones this is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: important topic and honestly this is a
really kind of pivotal moment in history
[SPEAKER_01]: like politics exists on a pendulum if you
the longer look you take down the
[SPEAKER_01]: historical timeline the clearer this gets
things go liberal then things go
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative the roaring 20s and all the
liberalism and drinking and dancing and
[SPEAKER_01]: the sexual revolution that took place in
the 20s was completely crushed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: crash markets or the stock market crash in
the 1930s and 40s everything reversed hard
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've seen that a couple of times
historically this the 60s gave us the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking 80s like disco is responsible for
shoulder pads and suits for women all
[SPEAKER_01]: through the 80s I think marijuana has been
moving forward as a social policy in a
[SPEAKER_01]: major way since 1999 all movements bend
towards legalization there's bound to be
[SPEAKER_01]: at least an effort at a backswing and
that's needed before the galvanization of
[SPEAKER_01]: the country and we decide that no as a
group we're not gonna go back to that and
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually take the next big step forward
and start changing federal law and it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like this idiotic move by sessions
might have actually triggered that
[SPEAKER_01]: avalanche there's a couple of different
people talking about this that I mean man
[SPEAKER_01]: on Monday this wasn't a major talking
point already the people who were mumbling
[SPEAKER_01]: about maybe running against Trump in 2020
are talking about legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: protections Republicans that were in hotly
contested races right now going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: next election cycle for statewide
elections are pissed because now their
[SPEAKER_01]: option is come out against something the
Trump administration's doing i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: their own party's doing and maybe piss off
their base or come out for marijuana and
[SPEAKER_01]: seem like a liberal druggy and that's not
a conversation they wanted to have going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the next round of elections and now
that's the conversation they're all having
[SPEAKER_01]: good stir that shit up yep if you're the
donating type hop online find your
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives that are really supporting
of this and send them one of those $4.20
[SPEAKER_01]: donations let them know exactly why
they're getting a few bucks from you who
[SPEAKER_02]: said that who said that $4.20 donation
thing up honestly I can't remember if it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like Russ Belville or Tom Angle or
just some putts at high times like it
[SPEAKER_01]: could have been anybody but that's been
going for a few months in it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: you that have started to get a handful of
those elected representatives for months
[SPEAKER_01]: have been getting donations like that
normal the national organization for the
[SPEAKER_01]: reform of marijuana laws the marijuana
policy project students for essential
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible drug policy all of those groups
have been getting a lot of $4.20 donations
[SPEAKER_02]: since this came up if of course there's
our patreon account my patreon account for
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow from your heart podcast but I
want to spread some love also if you had
[SPEAKER_02]: to recommend one cannabis support group or
somebody that needed some funding where
[SPEAKER_02]: would you send $4.20 to right now if you
could pick one group he went silent and
[SPEAKER_01]: started staring at that's not an easy
question because there's a lot of groups
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a lot of good work on different
fronts
[SPEAKER_01]: okay like if I was only gonna make one
political donation period it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: for pot which is kind of fucked up to say
on this show but it would go not
[SPEAKER_01]: everything pots not everything it's hard
but if I was gonna make one marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: focused contribution right now it would be
one of two places I think I would either
[SPEAKER_01]: go for normal they're the oldest they're
the longest they're the strongest they're
[SPEAKER_01]: the most organized and the best
represented it's hard to go wrong with
[SPEAKER_01]: normal and I would go for Gavin Newsom if
you're from the California area or you
[SPEAKER_01]: follow politics you know who that man is
and his next couple of years look really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting and we don't have a stronger
ally in politics at his level right now
[SPEAKER_02]: well then I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna
choose normal if you guys are gonna throw
[SPEAKER_02]: down a contribution and it's not going to
be the grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: patreon go support normal the national
organization for the reform of marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: laws there's no RML right they're so old
that you see normal on is it it's Cheech's
[SPEAKER_02]: shirt in the nice dreams show is it nice
dreams the Cheech and Chong one of the old
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheech and Chong movies Cheech's normal's
been around fighting since the 70s yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: and Cheech is wearing the shirt proudly
they go to the dudes greenhouse where the
[SPEAKER_02]: lizard guy is growing the weed he's
wearing the fucking normal shirt there bro
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's how long normal has been around
so it's been around a very long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: no normal know this show no conversations
like this that's right I remember a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time ago and I was reading high times and
all that stuff just being a young weed
[SPEAKER_02]: head not knowing what I was even starting
to get into I knew that normal was the way
[SPEAKER_02]: to go so I'm glad that you said normal if
you're gonna send a contribution somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: you've already contributed to my show or
you want to spread some love into their
[SPEAKER_02]: direction go support your your local
normal may be the way to go if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a local normal chapter go check them out
and if this is a story you want a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: information on a I'm sure we'll do a news
updates as this develops because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely it's not the first move in a
dance it's it's a move in a dance that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been going on for decades so there will
definitely be updates on this show and
[SPEAKER_01]: updates on Pueblo for sensible Canada's
laws yeah this is gonna be ongoing until
[SPEAKER_02]: all 50 states are legal and it's federally
legal so I just took a dab while Mike was
[SPEAKER_02]: ranting I took a dab of the sour joker I
went in a little deeper than I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw me a life raft yeah I hope we
covered all the bases this apothecary is

a lot of people are thrown out to well

[SPEAKER_01]: my head it's this is uh I mean this is a
big story with a lot of implications I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure we hit all the bases um
a lot of people are freaking out like some
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana to stocks which were a shitty
investment anyway um took a big crash
[SPEAKER_01]: after this announcement but have already
fully rebounded um because it took a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute for everybody to remember like oh
yeah they call it the co-memo because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just a memo um and that in reality
nothing has changed since nothing I go to

email it's grow from your heart at hotmail
[SPEAKER_02]: .com you know I love listener emails I
spoke about it earlier I'll remind you
[SPEAKER_02]: once again don't forget about patreon if
you like this page this podcast was worth
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple bucks and you'd like to
contribute you can go to patreon.com slash
[SPEAKER_02]: grow from your heart if you'd like to sign
up and contribute as little as one dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: I would appreciate it if you want to
contribute as much as I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a limit on how many nines or zeros
you press in there so just keep typing
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll see what the limit is we'll see if
we can blow that patreon up but I would
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate it if you support me on patreon
what that does is help me cover the cost
[SPEAKER_02]: of my website it helps me buy these little
hey Mike I try not to but sometimes I spit
[SPEAKER_01]: into the microphone cover you know it
doesn't stink it doesn't smell like
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you wait last time do you
remember the orange one that was here for
[SPEAKER_02]: like the first four months you did podcast
that was another guy the creepy mustache
[SPEAKER_02]: guy it haunts me he used to spit into it a
lot it's yeah whenever we break the
[SPEAKER_01]: microphones out I do a tentative kind of
sniff test yeah before I get right up on
[SPEAKER_02]: it there's a little bag of them on the
other side of the recording equipment I
[SPEAKER_02]: keep them over there and when people leave
I just pop them out and there's a reason
[SPEAKER_01]: this show sounds as good as it does folks
and it's because Jeff's got some nice
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and sometimes pieces of that
equipment eat it eat themselves we had
[SPEAKER_02]: that fucking headphone amplifier we ate
through like five of them yeah we went
[SPEAKER_01]: through a good half dozen of those in a
year I had to go to guitar center and get
[SPEAKER_02]: an upgrade eventually they looked at me
like what are you doing to them they'd see
[SPEAKER_02]: your van pulling and just get one here's
two just take two this time and when they
[SPEAKER_02]: break bring them back so that way you've
got a backup already but I just upgraded
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces that's all but yeah sometimes shit
does go wrong sometimes things break I pay
[SPEAKER_02]: for high-speed internet because uploading
these large devices don't like hash I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't I don't know why they fight so much
don't don't talk about how stupid I've had
[SPEAKER_02]: my iPhone on my computer are you could
stick them all to the wall and use it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: desk but yeah the patreon campaign you
guys I use it to pay for the website the
[SPEAKER_02]: website does cost quite a bit of money
every year to cover so your patreon
[SPEAKER_02]: contributions will cover the cost of my
website you guys were kind enough to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: the website for me in 2017 so it does cost
a little chunk of money to pay for the
[SPEAKER_02]: domain name and pay for all the hosting I
pay for a lot of bandwidth because I use a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of bandwidth on that fucking website
every episode is available like the last
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred episodes I think is available that
cost a little bit to host but thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys covered it I appreciate it so
that's what I do with the patreon funds
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry I'm trying to clear my throat while
I talk took a big old dab it's catching up
[SPEAKER_02]: with me patreon.com slash grow from your
heart see how many nines you can put in
[SPEAKER_02]: the contribution box the challenge is on
all right ladies and gentlemen no I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get rich from podcasting I love
doing the pot if I do get rich from
[SPEAKER_02]: podcasting fuck yeah but that was never my
goal I honestly how it started I was
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting not how but part of how it started
was I used to hang out with Maddie and
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence at their house and people would
come through all the time and we'd smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: and hang out and dab and the people would
be like Rasta Jeff tell me this about
[SPEAKER_02]: plants help me grow and I would say it and
they would leave and then somebody would
[SPEAKER_02]: come over and ask the same damn question
and Maddie and Spence would look at me
[SPEAKER_02]: like are you gonna say the same damn shit
and I'd be like but he asked me the same
[SPEAKER_02]: question and I was like you know what I
should do I should record this shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it all clicked in my head I was like
you should record this shit like I really
[SPEAKER_02]: got I was like yeah yeah yeah get a
microphone record it make a podcast I was
[SPEAKER_02]: already doing a podcast with another guy
about other totally non cannabis related
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and I was like we'll just fucking
start recording it do a show about it I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: so glad that clicked in your head yeah
yeah well that's kind of yeah so I'm glad
[SPEAKER_01]: it happened if listeners if you've got
other news stories or other topics you
[SPEAKER_01]: want us to cover shoot us an email I don't
know if I'll do this many notes for your
[SPEAKER_01]: question but we'll try to knock it out of
the park for you all right you guys I feel
