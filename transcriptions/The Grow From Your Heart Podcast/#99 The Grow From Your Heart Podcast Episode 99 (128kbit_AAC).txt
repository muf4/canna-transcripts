[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 99 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop down that music a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting carried away already today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I said 99 and it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that means next one is a hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to party it up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm honored to have our guest with
us sitting in front of me as a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: guest, a frequent guest.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many episodes has he been on lately,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our buddy, white Mike over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking good on Mike too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sitting to my left is a good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually Doug's medical marijuana
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: My good buddy, Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had some crowd noise for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming, Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am his caregiver and our topic for the
show is going to be the way that different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways of consuming your cannabinoids,
the way of using your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way taking your medicine differently
affects your mind and your body and maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: even your spirit a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we get there, I'm going to brag
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've been talking about the spot
dispensary a whole bunch on this podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike and I spend 132 hours per week there
ish ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a great spot to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great place to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great spot to be in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, yesterday we were wrapping up
work and the boss walked up to me and he
[SPEAKER_03]: said mandatory meeting today, five o'clock
at the Pueblo Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I smiled and I said, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, yeah, put on your Sundays
because we're in the top three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get there and it was the best of
Pueblo Convention and our spot won the
[SPEAKER_03]: best dispensary in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a local competition for I think there
are 180 categories this year ranging from
[SPEAKER_02]: like best teacher to best cop to best
bakery, best lawyer, best hairdresser.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we won best dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got a little gold plaque in the
office and we are going to be well
[SPEAKER_03]: advertised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we've got something to brag about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our picture's in the paper today.
[SPEAKER_03]: For our picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have a really cool picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took a picture in front of the Bob
Marley mural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice big team picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a colorful shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight in the morning, taking a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of people that work at a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those that weren't aware that you
were the best, now they know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got a year to brag about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: One whole year.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's get into where I'm done
bragging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Rob at the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to the whole team at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that does everything they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grow team, the bud team, the trimming
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bud tenting crew, all the managers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that signs the paychecks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to everybody that's involved
at the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are kick ass and let's keep
kicking ass, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get off the tootin' heart on horn
and advertising our work all the time on
[SPEAKER_03]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a way we're really here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these two guys have been responsible
for their medical marijuana for over five
[SPEAKER_03]: years that I can say for sure,
without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five or six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say closer to eight or ten,
maybe even.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a good sense of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly do not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I used to remember time periods
by what fish shows I went to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been to a lot of fish shows,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to document, yeah, how much time I
was spending places.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been responsible for these guys'
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have noticed that when Mike wants to
get high, he wants to smoke some sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: like some jelly bean that we just took
dabs of or some golden goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when Mike needs medicine, he reaches
for the heavy CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this jar over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If either one of you would like a dab of
this big crystal clear honey oil,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's almost pure CBD that was given to
me by a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: When these guys, excuse me for the cough,
when these guys are hurting, when they
[SPEAKER_03]: feel pain, they hit me up and they're
like, do you have something extra CBD for
[SPEAKER_03]: me right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mike's got sore hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug was an old railroad worker over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to picture this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in jeans and a flannel shirt with a
big ass knife.
[SPEAKER_03]: on his belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: This man looks like he is ready to do some
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you need done, I'm sure and
confident Doug can handle that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would certainly give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you'd get it done a little better
than myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, maybe depending on what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some things that I bet I could
do, but Doug's a confident man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can work, but he's an old railroad guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's pretty much broken all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broken all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back, knees, all the joints, all the
joints are in bad shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that AGE has got a little bit to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, you're getting a little bit up
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mind if I ask you how old you are
on the show, my friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 61 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friend Doug is 61 and medical
cannabis is keeping this dude moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he hurts, we give him some CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to kind of jump into this
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a favorite way to consume your
CBD medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite way to consume is with my
little electric pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: My old lady calls it the pacifier because
it's always around my neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hanging on your neck on a lanyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know when you're going to need
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the most resin coated
things I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell that that thing has been
around the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it had to have a little
extra work done to it because those glass
[SPEAKER_01]: tops just don't work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been a little modified there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's custom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there at a moment once notice and
it's the way that seems to, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: anytime you smoke it, we all know that
that's the quickest way to get it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're in pain and you want
relief now, I find that's the quickest
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going to hurt most frequently?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're hanging out, what are you going
to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, this hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to grab first?
[SPEAKER_01]: My hip, my lower back.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you're probably going to say,
shit, that hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second thought is going to be,
where's my vape pen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long from inhaling off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, how many rips off that pen
does it take to kind of give you a little
[SPEAKER_03]: relief, to notice some easing of the pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: To notice easing of the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like a doctor as I asked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably within two or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three rips off the vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not under oath or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding the damn thing in my hand and
knowing that I'm about to take a hit off
[SPEAKER_01]: of it starts the process right there
because I know relief is on its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've told you this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your definition of what a painkiller is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that CBDs help control pain,
but marijuana in general changes your
[SPEAKER_01]: outlook on pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, uh, and what is pain
relief?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what, that's what
painkillers do is they, well, we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: there there's chemicals that go in and
shut down certain receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, uh, maybe the THC part is making
you forget that you hurt and helping your
[SPEAKER_03]: mind go to a better place instead of being
focused on that hip and that lower back
[SPEAKER_03]: going out on you and hurting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two or three rips and you start feeling
that forgetting about the pain and a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of pain going away.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long does that take?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can try if you want, if you want to
take two rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my mouth and once it gets into the
hand, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's in the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts right then immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within about two or three rips,
which only takes you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but so within a minute you're able to
go back to doing whatever you needed to
[SPEAKER_03]: do, take care of the kid, water the dog,
walk the dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I see you walk, he's got a dog that
needs a lot of walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see you walking with buddy quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to buddy, the dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within 30 seconds, now if you were to
take, and I won't even ask any about,
[SPEAKER_03]: about any pharmaceuticals that I know you
take, but if you were to take a
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical to treat that pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, 20 minutes, 20 minutes,
you know, if you're lucky and then what
[SPEAKER_03]: are the shitty side effects?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well he just leaned back into his
chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, you got all day and we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take your time, opioids,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the major ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anywhere from the dry mouth to a
listless feeling to constipation,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to give you another
medicine for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's their, that's the way they do
medicine anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they barely want to touch you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just prescribe another medication and
see how that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it you want Skype and then prescribe
you some more shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know that I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will never do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Skyping with your doctor is not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want my doctor to touch me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you, you know, you'd like to be able
to look around the room and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: diplomas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be sitting there with just a shirt
on cause that's, you know, that's all you
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you can look around and you
like, you know, there's interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: between humans that doesn't happen on sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially someone from your generation,
your Skype is probably fucking fangled
[SPEAKER_03]: technology for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep current, but we don't expect
you to be that current.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was periscoping earlier you guys and
Doug had no idea what was happening for
[SPEAKER_03]: the first 30 seconds of that periscope
video.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking around the room like,
what's he talking to?
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually said, I'm going to periscope
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get back on topic here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within 30 seconds to a minute,
you're feeling relief from the CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: your pain and your hip isn't hurting,
but 20 minutes if you take some medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: and dude also thinks a lot for getting,
let me get so personal asking about your
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine and talking about your side
effects and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of deep compared to taking
pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see why we can't grow our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why they don't want us to grow our own
medicine when this dude can feel better in
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 minutes from taking a drip off of a
vape pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's money, but it works so well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like what you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If cannabis didn't do half of what it
does, like it would be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we discovered it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be celebrated everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone should print that on a shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: If cannabis didn't do half of what it
does, it wouldn't, it would be illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it, if it just worked as medicine,
if we could just replace, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cotton with it, like all the
pharmaceutical companies would be replaced
[SPEAKER_03]: by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about all, like there's,
there's still use for plenty of what
[SPEAKER_02]: pharma has to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cannabis replaces a lot of what
we're using it at pharma inappropriately
[SPEAKER_02]: for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that's taking Vicodin realizes that
we, Colorado just upped the, upped it
[SPEAKER_01]: from, I think a grade two or grade three
to a grade two narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no refills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go to your doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get a hard script from them
and walk it to your pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be filled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a certain day, it's, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and the reason is because of the
incredible losses that we've had of life
[SPEAKER_01]: due to overdosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on the streets everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier sometimes to find stupid drugs
and pills than it is to find weed before
[SPEAKER_03]: we had dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could find the weed, but back in the
day, it, you'd run into other drugs and
[SPEAKER_03]: can't find the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually would be easier for me to
get some of this medication on this street
[SPEAKER_01]: than it is from the doctor anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's what unfortunately results
to in heroin use when you can't get those
[SPEAKER_03]: pills anymore from your insurance company
running out or your doctor being
[SPEAKER_03]: unavailable, then you're going to have to
go and not, I know you wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an older dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a strong mind and we'll keep you
medicated with good weed, but other folks
[SPEAKER_03]: that don't have good weed and a good
caregiver and a good family like yourself,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would have to go to the street and
get something because their body hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sick from not having their pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: All 50 states are facing an increase in
heroin use right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly why is regularly
regular folk get hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to the doctor, the doctor throws
opiates at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take the pill until their bones not
broken anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time they're healed,
they're now addicted to whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: painkiller they were on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they gotta go find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually they get cut off or it becomes
too expensive and they turn to heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some help if you need help you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please feel free to tell the doctor,
no, you don't need pain pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sometimes you need pain pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying people don't because I've
used them many, many times, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I broke my finger, I had to
refuse pain med six different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept asking if the pain was going to get
any worse and they kept looking at me like
[SPEAKER_02]: I was insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is that noise?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a phone on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It vibrates stupid loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was the music in the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what is happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike, I want to ask you the same
question kind of that I was asking Doug
[SPEAKER_03]: since we got off track here and I need to
find a good launching spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask what your medical condition is
that you smoke for?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to go too into detail
if you don't feel like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The short version version is I damaged my
neck and never had cartilage in my knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I need something that helps with
inflammation and nerve generated pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis works wonderfully where most
of the drugs available on the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical market don't do anything
for nerve generated pain.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how long, if you took a, what's your
preferred method of smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, dabbing because I'm so spoiled.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've currently upgraded Mike's smoking
status until about a month or two ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a heavy flower smoker in a pipe,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pipe and flowers or bong and bong and
flowers if I had a bong handy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I broke my beautiful bong a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rest in peace bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have just been piping it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then recently upgraded to an oil rig
and a nice nail and a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been doing a lot of dabs lately,
but flowers are still sort of my first
[SPEAKER_02]: love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike showed up with some delicious jelly
bean hash today.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tastes fucking hella good and I'm
highest from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, the most common way I
consume these days is with tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do three milliliters of synergy,
which is a half THC half CBD tincture
[SPEAKER_02]: compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, really low dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take it sort of as a preventative
morning and evening to help keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation down before it gets bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems to work wonders for my
knees and for my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do those cost for a customer?
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 bucks before tax for a hundred
milligrams total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, that's a week's worth of meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 bucks for a week worth of meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get 30 doses per bottle and I'm taking
six a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not even a seven day week for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a five day week for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's worth it for 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was paying more when I was just taking
pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pills are expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you've just got a copay or
something pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing a copay and it was still
90 bucks a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some Vicodin when I got some wisdom
teeth pulled and going to get those was
[SPEAKER_03]: like 14 bucks for like seven pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the generic shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, I don't even really
need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I want to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw down a bunch of money for pills that
I don't need.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I stopped taking pills, I was on two
different pain medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither of them were opiates, but neither
of them worked for shit either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was on a third med to help cope
with some of the side effects from the
[SPEAKER_02]: first two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I started smoking regularly and
first got access to CBD flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a need for the pills at all
the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just didn't take them one day and
then I didn't take them the next day
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you're drug free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, except for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're drug free, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think cannabis is like a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a plant, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a plant, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still totally a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very good one.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't do any hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how long, how long does those,
go ahead Doug, you had something to say on
[SPEAKER_03]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I was just interested in what he
was saying, but I was thinking while he
[SPEAKER_01]: was saying that, that since I'm primarily
using concentrates now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten completely off of two narcotic
medications that I was getting through my
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: From smoking concentrates on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: From smoking concentrates on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long, how often do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably starting within an hour after I
wake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well just, yeah, cause you got to keep the
pain away before it sets in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a head start on the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then throughout the day, it's not like
a sit down smoke fest for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the pacifier hanging on your
neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just grab it and take a couple
of rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm going along my merry way,
it happens to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things I really like
about my pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find myself using it when I get home
between like walking in the door from work
[SPEAKER_02]: and then like getting the dogs taken care
of, getting the kid taken care of,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting dinner around, getting,
you know, checking in with the other
[SPEAKER_02]: family members to see how their day went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time to sit down and take a
dab and put my feet up or sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The single life's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the email on and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like four rigs on the table to
hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't have this kitchen set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had four 14 year olds walk into my house
at three 30 today, like looking for a
[SPEAKER_02]: place to spend an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you let them, you know,
it becomes a permanent roosting place for
[SPEAKER_01]: a half hour every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much, how much hash, how long does
a grandma hash last you?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think I want to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grandma hash last me three, maybe four
days tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting down on about a quarter
gram of good quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, this is the same hash that I
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug gets the hash that I smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I get a slab, I break some off and it
goes to Doug's directory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got him kind of on a good schedule
and yeah, so I try to get mine around the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time and we all, I get, he gets the
same shit that I get.
[SPEAKER_03]: He smokes what I smoke you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's smoking top quality shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sometimes it's wax if there's good wax
around, but it's usually top quality snap
[SPEAKER_03]: and general type shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of Weed and shatter 90% of the time
or the turpex boys or the turpex boys,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is also very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's smoking the same stuff as me about
a quarter gram a day through a vape pen to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep himself medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys, you can get that at a
medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be 30, 35 bucks at a rec
shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, how much is a gram of turpex ash
going to cost us?
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 plus tax comes to 58 change at the
door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 55 58 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 58 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't think that scares all of
us that are on medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: that see dispensaries changing from just
medical to medical and recreational,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then possibly to just recreational,
uh, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do my best to keep taking
care of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to take Doug to renew
his medical marijuana card on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's we keep up on that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find rec hash in a range of prices
between like 25 and 30 gram up to 90 a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram here locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's not always quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of real mediocre
amateur product on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're are even our legal market
doesn't have all of the things in place
[SPEAKER_02]: that it should quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, standards are still a little lax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a little off topic, but did you buy
any of the live wax from the spot?
[SPEAKER_03]: The TR concentrates?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not purchased any, but I have
consumed some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like a review of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupendous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupendous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: See one word that works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some of the stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got half a dozen flavors on the
shelf now, but I got some of the stardog
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I may be investigate investing in
some of this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, the night I dropped my rig,
um, I got to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the consolation 10 minutes
later while I was mourning the loss of my
[SPEAKER_02]: original rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I got to hit some, what was 90 grams
is now 75 a gram hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may step in there after, after a work
tomorrow and grab some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me if you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I asked Doug how quickly it works,
how he consumes it and how much of it he
[SPEAKER_03]: uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to jump to Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about how he's using
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask about when you've been
dabbing lately, how many dabs does it take
[SPEAKER_03]: for you to feel relief?
[SPEAKER_02]: One to feel relief to, to kind of push the
pain down to where it's sort of like your
[SPEAKER_02]: toe itches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no longer something of, um,
it's something you're aware of,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not something of importance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I feel after work is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I start out with pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually about three, what I think of his
Mike size dabs, which are fairly small
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he does about a third.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say maybe 0.1 a dab,
maybe even a little less than that
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but after about three, like there's
some intoxication and like a lot more fun
[SPEAKER_02]: going on than, than just medical effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that first dab is all just turning the
pain down from a five down into the one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two range.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two and a half dabs would be cool,
but you take that number three cause you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't take a half dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, then there's some,
then there's some intoxication going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, but you can handle six or eight
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sit here and take eight or 10 and
still be coherent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just be really stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stoned and a little giddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get to the, uh, the synergy drops
that you've been taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you said you take three milliliters.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, three milliliters in the morning and
the three at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dosing is 1.7 milligrams of THC
and CBD per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I remember this, I'm taking about
5.8 milligrams of each in the morning and
[SPEAKER_02]: then in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I could drink the whole a hundred
milligram bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50 milligrams of both, just drink it
down like a shot or a chug it like a beer
[SPEAKER_02]: and not get much intoxication from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I take it in small doses in the
morning, in the evening, it feels like my
[SPEAKER_02]: knees never get to the point where they're
really swollen and stiff and achy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my neck never gets to the point where
it's just a solid bar of muscle cramped
[SPEAKER_02]: up, trying to protect those vertebrae that
are squeezing nervous nerve stems going
[SPEAKER_02]: down that arm.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys, I feel like my mic is really
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, part of what, why they're doing the
THC CBD combo is I believe that you need
[SPEAKER_03]: both cannabinoids to get into your
bloodstream, to work together,
[SPEAKER_03]: to hit the mind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: To take your mind off of things,
to work on the, the THC hits the nerve
[SPEAKER_03]: pain, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the CBD goes for the, like the swollen
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think together you don't get super
high from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't feel much high from the CBD THC
50 50 combo because the CBD really feels
[SPEAKER_03]: like it calms down the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, there's research into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD keeps the THC high from being quite a
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the CBD helps kind of tone it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, I've heard people carry CBD pills
from time to time when there's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme consumption going on, just in case
anybody goes a little overboard,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got sort of a come down lever that
they can pull.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your girlfriend takes a big dab and
can't handle her shit, you just give her a
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD dab and she'll relax a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or somebody doesn't read the label and
eats the whole candy bar and never did it
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, then you just want to leave them alone
and not give them any more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give them some cartoons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some good food, make them a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, how much does the synergy cost?
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 a bottle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it lasts you a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, five days, five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Doug's plant pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to a dispensary, it's going to
be 40, 45, 30, maybe 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can find like member pricing and
you get that first time shopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple that I've seen advertise
it on certain days at certain times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a special or something,
but I've never been able to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: constant quality like you deliver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, the difference between a good
caregiver and a bad caregiver is being
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of hammered out on this show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that I did not have to charge Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything for the, uh, the hash that he
consumes, but it doesn't always come from
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to go get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to just relay it and I don't
make a penny off of my, my caregiver and
[SPEAKER_03]: this for people like people that I am
their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't make any money off of those
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug stays pretty well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some flow right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some nice flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have some white widow in a couple of
few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So will Mike, Mike just looked at me like,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have that ever so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craving for the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, uh, you know, I, I'm a dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, uh, I fucking going to jump
into this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take fat dad, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my knees hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: My knees fucking hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys were ever near me and hear me
bend over or just crouch down,
[SPEAKER_03]: my knees sound like shotguns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be as tall as we are and not
have any issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause my knees get wobbly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes when I'm tired, like they just
get like shaky and my hips hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, I've got some stomach issues
you guys and not a lot of, but my stomach
[SPEAKER_03]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some stomach problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so I take fat, fat dad, you guys,
I take, um, some more between 0.3 and 0.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to smoke about a gram and a half a
hash a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I do that in about three sessions
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take about one dab in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right when, like not right when I get up
and get myself, I like get up to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning shower and get dressed right
before I leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take one dab just so that I'm kind of
crispy when I'm getting where I'm going at
[SPEAKER_03]: lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I may get a little dab, like about a
0.3 and then do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take some of that CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after work, I'll come home and
take like a 0.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, before the show,
I did about a 0.5 and then later on in the
[SPEAKER_03]: evening before bed, I'll just drop like
another 0.5 instead of taking 30 dabs
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take like six or seven of them,
I guess maybe three to six fat dabs
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that keeps me well medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's expensive, but since I'm the,
I produce it myself mostly like that part,
[SPEAKER_03]: or I get it from Spence, Garden of Weedon
kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I should be saying that
much on the show, but, uh, since the
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of Weedon can supply us with
quality hash and dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: I work at a shop that can supply me with
quality hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I go to a medical shop and buy a
bunch of shit all the time, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, I smoke a lot and I stay well
medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to eat edibles, but they hit me
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do edibles hit you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they hit me hard too, but it's
because you're consuming a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's staying within your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not blowing out 35% of what you
just took in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the rush is a little different the way
that it feels when it starts to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it comes on slower,
but hits a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, more of a body healing problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you take some CBD oil and some of the
jelly bean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I use the CBD oil to keep the jelly
bean wax stuck to the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prepare to hear me cough like a sissy
girl, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to work oddly, but I trust
you with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't burn self or microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's playing with the email cord and the
dab rig and the microphone in his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the pothead Olympics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some kind of stone or obstacle course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cord management, bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cord management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you on the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I want to ask him, when he gets done
coughing, I'm going to ask him about how
[SPEAKER_03]: he likes edibles and how they work for
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Doug, you were talking earlier about
how medicine just totally helps your like
[SPEAKER_03]: psychological whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need a sativa or does a CBD
medicine get to your head a little bit as
[SPEAKER_03]: well?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you smoke the Tora Bora, the Tora
Bora is really high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can use that as a specific plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really liked the Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to DNA genetics for breeding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a shout out to the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got me a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, you can tell between different
strains, even with some that say they are
[SPEAKER_01]: the same strain, different ways that it
affects you as you, as you're ingesting
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, some more mentally than
physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of forget about the pain
before the relief of the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tora Bora is more of relief of the
pain and then the mental aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it comes in, knocks out the pain and
then later on it gets you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I don't smoke a lot of the CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, it doesn't do much for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these guys get all the CBD products
that I get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gifted that hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: If Doug wants a dab of that one,
give him a dab of that one too,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, make sure Doug gets some CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give a shot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give it too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get big dabs of the CBD oil
because it's super viscous.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dabbers got a flat tip on it and it
may work a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shuffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like it was burning for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that weird how your body can do
that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, winter is here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about winter, but fall is
certainly here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a long sleeve shirt when you
drive to work in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Season done changed, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking medically, I know we're
talking about pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear what you have to say,
Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm disabled with post-traumatic
stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's been a lot of studies
looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's probably the best
medicine for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried and had been prescribed many other
things, but I believe that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the best thing that I've ever had
that helps me control what goes on with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to, yeah, I probably got a
similar thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to compare myself,
but I probably got something and I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I start thinking about shit that I
don't even want to think about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make those things not happen in my
mind just by coming and just taking a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may be part of the ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you were saying earlier, just grab a
dab, get into the internet, play around
[SPEAKER_03]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also, for me, it's real hard for,
I used to love to go anywhere there was
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that way anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have to get prepared to go to the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because I don't know what I'm going to
get, because I get the same thing every
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but just to deal with people in
close quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it make you nervous?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes me uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather not deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I come up and the parking lot's
completely full or you look over and the
[SPEAKER_01]: baskets are almost all gone, I just go
back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which even if I really need the
food, I'll just go back home, chill for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and wait for the crowds to die
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bread and cheese ain't that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, not that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, sometimes you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got other people depending on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you suck it up and you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes faced with those types of
situations, cannabis definitely helps me
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit of anxiety, a little bit
of TSD, a little bit of social anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody's listening that doesn't
think that this shit is good for PTSD,
[SPEAKER_03]: because in Colorado, we cannot get it
validated as a qualifying condition for
[SPEAKER_03]: medical treatment or for medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys think that that's not a reason
to use it, listen to this dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an honest guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude has never lied to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe every single word that Doug has
ever said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's got no reason to lie to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a 60 year old dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done his thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those days you're lying.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to lie and days are done
passing a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nobody to impress anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take some dabs with these
kids and be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love having you around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I enjoy being with you and I'm going
to enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Salute.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my good friend Doug is taking a really
quite wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a shout out to the person that gave
it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they want to be mentioned
on the show or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do nice work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pain is melting as we speak.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cherry flavor.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke a lot of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saved all that for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was kind of over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of tucked away until you guys
showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a mouthful of cherries out of
the hit man rig with the elevate dropdown
[SPEAKER_03]: on the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we're champs over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was marvelous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on for helping them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, Mike with the, uh, it looks like
some climbed up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This car cap needs to be cleaned a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get quite filthy around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirty car.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody needs dad, there's a little wax
in here, but I think you guys will be cool
[SPEAKER_03]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Doug was talking about, uh,
Oh, you were talking about how bad helps
[SPEAKER_03]: with the PTSD.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we, you know, the military
was looking into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they found out that they didn't want
to do it right now, but I, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you were to talk some
people that were suffering from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I think we see a lot of them around
town now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is where the help is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people are coming here and you
guys, unfortunately what I've discovered
[SPEAKER_03]: through some conversations lately,
there are a lot of children moving here
[SPEAKER_03]: for CBD treatment and those people are
falling into traps with people that
[SPEAKER_03]: advertise that they can give them CBD
medicine and they're not providing the CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, if you're looking for
qualified, legitimate CBD medicine in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado, somebody that can take on a new
person and provide that it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: three month wait, maybe six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The caregivers are strapped and with the
new regulations taking effect in January,
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt, um, many more people will be
becoming caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expect a number of caregivers in
business now to end up not being
[SPEAKER_02]: caregivers sometime by the middle of next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the state's really looking to clamp
down and kind of stamp out that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: section of our industry, which sucks for
people like me and Doug.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of new rules coming down the
pipe that are going to make it incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult for people to produce the amount
of meds they need for their patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and that's, and that's by
design.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want everybody buying from the
stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to see Walmart type stores
in the future.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like we talked about earlier,
I'm already having to source other shatter
[SPEAKER_03]: to get you guys supplied in your shatter
because everybody stepped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was a good idea for me
to step everybody up to shatter,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I got you guys all smoking good hash
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I can't even supply enough of it
because you guys smoke so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not complaining, but between the three
of us, we clean out the garden that I
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and other people that I know are
everybody's looking towards concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's so much more convenient and
it works better all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a better product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's the time saver is what I've
been enjoying lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my day is full.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hours are very, very well allocated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have extra time to grind up some
bud, pack a bowl, sit there and puff on it
[SPEAKER_02]: for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have that kind of time
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a quick dab gets me where I need to be
and I can get back to doing whatever I
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be doing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a fat dunk and keep on moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a dab cough for a minute,
chug a soda and get back to whatever I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the other half of the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make fun of Mike for a
minute, but this is all in good fun
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's one of my favorite people to
hang out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's my bro and he knows it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're ever with Mike and you are
thirsty, just tap him on the shoulder and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, just ask for a soda, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mike has a Mountain Dew with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike probably has six to 12 Mountain Dews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got sick of having cotton mouth and not
having anything to drink, so I did some
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people carry like their cigarettes in
like a safe spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's got Mountain Dews up his sleeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can fling them out of his arm like he's
Spiderman or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always got at least one in reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate you guys kind of letting
me talk a little bit about your conditions
[SPEAKER_03]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any, I want to change the
subject in just a second, but before I do,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give you guys the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything to add to this part
before I kind of move on to a totally
[SPEAKER_03]: random question that I want to ask you
guys about, just because I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys both look to me in silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to a bigger selection
of CBD edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be nice to just get up and eat
like a muffin or a bagel or a cookie or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever that just had your dose in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the way that this industry
is working, you guys aren't going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to eat muffins and cookies for much
longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to regulate the shit out of
it so much that a muffin will not be
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed a cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can airbrush that dumbass yellow
triangle on it, they're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can airbrush my poppy seed muffin
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulations on edibles are becoming
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting really ridiculous and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my favorite products are going to
be leaving store shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And coming back in 10 milligram maximum
containers, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kicking time is a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You betcha it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget how spoiled I am being a medical
patient, being able to walk into a shop
[SPEAKER_03]: and get a drink with a hundred milligrams
of THC and that sucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the rec side, you guys have to put
10 milligrams in them and drink 10 of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a hundred milligram drink
right now, but they're taking that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't carry the stamp, it's got to
be in a 10 milligram package period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can't stamp your shit no more,
I mean, you can't stamp liquids period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So liquids, popcorns, granolas,
that kind of thing has got to come in a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram container.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're actually going to put a stamp
on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: A stamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to stamp like a yellow
triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the teacher can see it from across
the room is the theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a triangle on my cookie,
look over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't it be parenting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't we focus on parenting instead of
labeling?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fucked up analogy that I came up with
is we put a special symbol on the fake
[SPEAKER_02]: guns, not the real ones, but we got to put
a special symbol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, all your toy guns got to come
with a little orange nub on the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: front of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no real gun doesn't need nothing on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know, this is a gun gun and
not like a lookalike gun or a squirt gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish somebody could have seen me
pressing my forehead against this
[SPEAKER_03]: microphone in retardation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now all the pot cookies have to carry
a special fucking warning symbol because
[SPEAKER_02]: people that have never been in a marijuana
shop are convinced that they look just
[SPEAKER_02]: like Chips Ahoy and that they're going to
be at a party one day and one of us is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to change out the real Chips Ahoy
for the medicated Chips Ahoy and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to kill everybody at their
church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to share the cookies with you
guys because you're my friends and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's weed in these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat them with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ginned up so much fear last Halloween
that we're definitely going to pass it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to head that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was part of what I was going to ask
here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two questions for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Halloween scare was one of them
because we were putting up Halloween
[SPEAKER_03]: decorations at the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, do you guys really think
that somebody is going to give out some
[SPEAKER_03]: weed candy this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mike kind of beat me to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year, they're going to eat it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two big anti-pot groups in the state
took out billboards with edibles out of
[SPEAKER_02]: their packaging next to candy or edible
treats that they look similar to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, if you can't tell the
difference, how were your kids?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a whole bunch of people in the state
were convinced that the day after
[SPEAKER_02]: Halloween, the ERs would just be full of
kids that were just high as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't happen for a lot of reasons,
mostly because it's the dumbest crime
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many better ways to get a
felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't hand out dirty candy on
Halloween and that leads right back to you
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's no payoff for the criminal
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got about three hours worth of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sick fuck that likes to hurt kids
doesn't like to hurt kids in theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 25 bucks a fucking piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who's got that kind of money to get
local kids stoned?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to eat them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys think that you have candy that
your kids got on Halloween and you suspect
[SPEAKER_03]: that it is medicated with cannabis,
you can send it right to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a PO box.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll pick it up in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come pick it up in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's fuck all this mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come pick it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all of it or half of it, whatever you
choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a little bit, I'll tell you if that
shit hasn't medicated cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if that's if it's medicated
with, with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always, it's always the scare tactic
about the children.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I was a child and went
trick or treating, people gave out popcorn
[SPEAKER_01]: balls and fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one year there was a massive
scare that someone was putting razor
[SPEAKER_01]: blades in those fruits and other things in
your cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't take grandma's treats
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to go buy them from the store and
they had to be packaged and Mars company
[SPEAKER_01]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you think did it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, do you think, and there was
never, it was the best marketing campaign
[SPEAKER_02]: Mars could have ever come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost too smart to spur a
corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They paid one of their kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me feed you this snicker or nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me feed you this random X brand candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost never happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put you on the news and we'll make
you rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the type of asshole who spent four
hours on the internet looking for cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happened like three times and two of
them, two of them were family members that
[SPEAKER_02]: were like, fuck my dumb ass nephew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's not funny, but it's
really funny because when you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: the links we've gone to as a nation to
like every nice old lady that's ever tried
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sugar cookies for all the kids
that come by and then like three hours
[SPEAKER_02]: into Halloween, they realized that they're
fucking sidewalks covered with sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies and all the parents think they're
insane because they just happen to miss
[SPEAKER_02]: that part of their, our mass education
against taking delicious treats from
[SPEAKER_02]: people on Halloween.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a cookie from a whole lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: She ain't got no reason to hate me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty scared of who I take candy from
as an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to grateful dead shows,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't take candy from strangers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can fuck up your whole weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, and as a responsible parent,
you look through that candy before you
[SPEAKER_01]: give your child just to make sure they're
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents love that rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got back the number of Snickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I fucking collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are no good for you, son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the special pile over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These might've been open or something
wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we used to go to the fancy
neighborhoods and find out where they were
[SPEAKER_03]: giving out the best candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would take two or three masks in my car
because we, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still trick or treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd cruise up to El Camino and university
park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, at least I wasn't stealing the bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my friends were out just taking
bags of candy from other kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually trick or treating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pled my case to some lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, you're too old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, I could have just been out
stealing candy from kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, here, take two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what I get.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, let's shift gears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Halloween.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you guys, this will be coming out a
little bit before Halloween.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since number 100 is going to be
celebration.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one after 101 will probably be the
Halloween show, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's October.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the fall celebration show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harvest party.
[SPEAKER_02]: The boo preview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvest party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost harvest time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should get Jesse on here to talk about
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people harvest then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop, chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if they got to keep it, it was rip time
also.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they got to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, number 100 is next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figured out what you're doing yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, we're going to have a bunch of
people on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk about stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know those shows when I set up like
six microphones and it gets chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take dabs and it's going to
be loud and Spence will hit Matty in the
[SPEAKER_03]: face with the microphone a lot and we'll
laugh a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I can get Matty and Spence over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another episode 50, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 times too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be twice as great.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to, uh, if you're
listening to the podcast this far,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love you for listening to our random
banter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to be dedicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's something you remember from
the first hundred episodes that you'd like
[SPEAKER_03]: me to reminisce about, uh, send me your
favorite moments of the show or let me
[SPEAKER_03]: know what you're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes you laugh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your favorite memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that sticks out to you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like remember that one time you said this,
uh, you can send a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, you're not limited to just one,
but tweet it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's at GFY podcast, email it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
or find it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the grow from your heart podcast on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Message me, let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll kind of reminisce about it and
go talk back.
[SPEAKER_03]: About it on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you let me know what episode be like an
episode this, you said this or just
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you know, let me know what you
remember and we'll laugh about it again
[SPEAKER_03]: and be like, I did say that because
sometimes I say some goofy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I say some great shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind me what stood out to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same goes for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like something I said on the show,
you guys have been getting a lot of me
[SPEAKER_02]: lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it?

[SPEAKER_03]: That's at Nemo punk 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he wants more followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you follow him, let him know that
you found him on the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know you're tweeting or you're
following me from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw me fucking with prohibitionists
and thought it was funny and wanted more
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you find me, uh, you're too stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug doesn't really do much social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep him on the down low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so lately as the hot topic has been,
uh, and we're just going to go on this one
[SPEAKER_03]: for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I wrote it down and I just want to
be able to cross it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm a completionist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, how do you guys feel about
professional athletes being able to use
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana first in their on season and
also in their off season?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's two different subjects.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on the clock and not off the clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when you're with the team,
they kind of own you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to make two separate separate
subjects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I say that wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that not good to say you don't look
like, no, I don't mean it like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do kind of, maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on your take on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you always be careful with that
particular rubbish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but in this case, you're not totally
in the wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they live under some pretty insane
fucking regiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on their clock all the time during
the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it doesn't, they're worth millions
and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, their health just keeps getting worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're on the clock basically during
the on season, the whole season from the
[SPEAKER_03]: time season starts from whatever preseason
training time spring, whatever spring
[SPEAKER_03]: training, when it starts, you're on the
clock until that super bowl or whenever
[SPEAKER_03]: your team is fucking finished,
whatever you fail or win, you're on the
[SPEAKER_03]: clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So should you be able to use cannabis to
alleviate your pains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, or for whatever reason, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a recreational state.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neuroprotectant research coming out
that's really promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it might really help, uh,
deal with concussions, brain injuries,
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be really, yeah, it might be
insanely, fucking helpful for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: get bashed in the face for a living rugby
players.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, boxers, soccer research is taking
place right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you feel that, uh, on their off season
is what I'm asking about now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel that those guys should be allowed
to consume cannabis medical or
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: On their, during the off season,
as much as they brought, as much as they'd
[SPEAKER_03]: like, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They can, they can drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: All it takes in color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: In any state, they're adults in all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was king of the world, it would have
been legal for everybody a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_03]: No Babylon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let everybody smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I'm sure you're going to say that
yes to this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, do you think that these guys,
um, and I'll ask about specific sports
[SPEAKER_03]: after it generalized, we'll just,
we'll kind of narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that professional athletes
should be able to consume cannabis on
[SPEAKER_03]: during the on season?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the night after a game, maybe the day
before a game, maybe what if you're a
[SPEAKER_03]: better, what if, what if you're a better
player when you smoke a fat joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they be able to play?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they be able to smoke right before
the game?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a performance enhancing
drug, but how many other performance
[SPEAKER_03]: enhancing drugs are those other football
players using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cannabis is so not a performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said that jokingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, they're, they're legitimately
testing people as though it's steroids and
[SPEAKER_02]: that when they're looking for steroids,
they, they also look for pot as though
[SPEAKER_02]: they're the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at best it's helping you focus or
keeping you from being in pain while you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not making you stronger, faster,
building your muscles up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not increasing your adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, but I have absolutely no issues with
people being inflamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have absolutely no issues with people
consuming cannabis when they're not at
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are a lot of people who do shit
that's kind of, well, that's why I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about sports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like football players crash into other
people with high speed and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of power there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that needs to be precisely controlled
or somebody's going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I'm down for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go watch people kill each other,
but we need to give them like swords and
[SPEAKER_02]: just call it gladiatorial fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're going to go that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like getting football players intoxicated
and letting them rush at each other is not
[SPEAKER_02]: how we get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be one of the things
people tweet about on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring back gladiators.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like Mike's point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And me saying that people own people,
it'll be the thing that I hear about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet I didn't mean it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a faux pas and I apologize now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not what I meant at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now sometimes we step in the trap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Words are hard these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm politically erect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everything means 11 things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, we all think that sports athletes,
the professional athletes should be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're allowed to drink alcohol if they
so choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Colorado, we have pretty much put
the same rules on booze or on the same
[SPEAKER_03]: rules on cannabis that we had for booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what they mirrored off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can, most of us can go out after a
hard day of whatever we do and we don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: how many, how many other people slam into
other people all day for a damn living.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like why can't these people go smoke a
little bit of reefer if their buddies can
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke, can drink some beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, I can't drink beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beer is no good for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beer does nothing good for me,
but smoking cannabis, I have plenty of
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal value and plenty of benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't go drink beer after work,
like several people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not judging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying that doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come home and smoke some weed,
smoke some dabs and it works wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have an alternative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shouldn't have to be confined to
places where you can't be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adults like to gather and enjoy
intoxicants with other adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's literally this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taxing us for us for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us some more to consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first humans around the first fire got
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they gathered to get fucked up around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How humans work throughout history.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always been a Tavern or I mean,
in different parts of the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the three corner or in many cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where people get together and
enjoy intoxicants and yeah, having a place
[SPEAKER_02]: where people can go and consume pot
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we sure do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole country needs places.
[SPEAKER_03]: One or two or three or four in every state
where we can all just meet and have a
[SPEAKER_03]: little puff sessions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: E-nails, dab rigs would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not be harassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not be harassed by the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we want you guys is to be able
to smoke cannabis peacefully and hang out
[SPEAKER_03]: and socialize.
[SPEAKER_03]: There won't be as many problems as you
have with alcohol consumption facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stone people don't want to fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can all get pretty heated in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some arguing beliefs between us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we can find something we disagree
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big flaw in Dazed and Confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody in this room is going to swing at
anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was beer in Dazed and Confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were drinking at the time too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to fight because he was out of
beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched that movie with a number of
people for the first time and typically
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the one comment that gets made
through the whole film is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: why is he aggressive?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was his weed bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude was drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came there to drink beer and kick ass
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all out of beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I really appreciate you guys for
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug, you got anything else you want to
add to us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should just hit stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we didn't give enough credit
to Edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of really wonderful edible
products on the market right now that you
[SPEAKER_02]: should definitely check out if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you recommend to somebody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chibichus just fucking went recreational
and I'm way excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sick of telling people,
no, they're not recreational yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're recreational now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look for them on store shelves at
direct shops in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys are out of state,
if you're anywhere in the world and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: 21 and up, you can come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fly to either Colorado Springs or Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fly to Denver and drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck the Colorado Springs airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver airport is going to take you two
and a half to three hours to get to our
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell everybody that you heard about the
spot dispensary on the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab yourself some Chibichus and grab
yourself some quality flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what else should they grab while
they're at the shop?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of legalization is you
have a huge selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something will catch your eye in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But come check out a Chibichu,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come get, if you want to get like kind of
high and be like trippy dippy,
[SPEAKER_03]: get like a Sativa Chibichu.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of the first edible companies
to really nail the Sativa Indica hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got a CBD chew now that I'm
just waiting to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw them get delivered just a few days
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chibichu guy was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to get kind of trippy,
get the Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to mellow out and gaggle,
get the Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Indica are intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to kind of a balanced high,
get those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the movies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a hybrid and go to the movies.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just looking for straight pain
relief and you don't want to feel high,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't want anybody to know that
you're consuming cannabis for pain relief,
[SPEAKER_03]: get the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the CBD chews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make your head, they don't make
you head high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make you giggly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come get some Chibichus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what they do for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe don't take them home.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, keep them here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a little Coco there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Joey Diaz?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, some Chibichus dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said Chibichus the second time,
you couldn't help it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, subconsciously Joey Coco Diaz is one
of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess subconsciously Joey Diaz just
slipped out of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go get some Chibichus dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got these stars of death, dog.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey's my hero.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back to Colorado, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening to this, Joey Diaz,
come back to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to come see you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious as a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have a lot else to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't give edibles enough credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Edibles are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take a little bit longer at work,
but when they do, boy, they really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to plan a little better with
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smoking so much simpler because you
can titrate your dose really, really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how hard what you just took is
going to hit you immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a little more, you can take a
little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're good, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that with edibles, it takes an
hour and a half to kick in and you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: uneat drugs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a bonus if you can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat yourself some edibles and then get
stoned and then try to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then hopefully you're sleeping and
those edibles will kick in while you're
[SPEAKER_03]: sleeping and keep you asleep through the
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've been doing with edibles
all summer long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get a hundred milligram package and
eat like 10 milligrams at eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 milligrams at nine, 20 at 10 and 20 at
11.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I go to bed, they're kicking
in for the first few hours of my sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that metabolism moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then have a full night's rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up eight hours later, feeling great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's quickly, we've talked about dabs
and smoking, dabs and flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about tinctures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about your vape pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of left out like rubs and
creams is all I think that's left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got one other product that we can
talk about if we have a couple seconds,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you look like you got some to say
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said rubs and creams,
I've talked to some people in my age
[SPEAKER_01]: bracket that are using some of the creams
for arthritis and, uh, and swear by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's, it's the best thing
that since sliced bread, I did not take
[SPEAKER_03]: them seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a friend of mine gave me a bottle
as a sample and I gave somebody a massage,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, just from the shoulders to the mid
back is all she let me do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by then, my fingers felt fluffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like I was wearing balloon gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, wow, that was like a
huge massage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, it's that apothecary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was apothecary pain cream is what I
used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, I definitely give the pains and
saps credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I did not before, but after that,
I believe I'm a believer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one of the, it was one of the first
generation topical lotions in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just random lotion in a bottle with
like a company sticker on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the brand was,
but I use it for after trimming to help
[SPEAKER_02]: absorb the rest of the trichomes off my
skin that I couldn't get washed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it worked wonderful for that,
but it would also help ease the pain from
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just you spend seven, eight hours
scissoring like a madman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fingers cramp up one hand's holding a
little stem all night, all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one's working a pair of
scissors for that whole shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pain cream, I mean, an hour after
I used it, I felt like I hadn't been at
[SPEAKER_02]: work all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the ladies that trimmed my
weed for me the other night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've covered, it seems like we've
covered 90% of the consumption methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have either of you guys tried Mike's had
some teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did those work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they have any medicinal value?
[SPEAKER_02]: The teas that I was really into on most of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the dose was so low and the
quality was so sketchy back then that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was probably just a good flavor tea that I
liked paying $5 a bag for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a couple of teas on the market
that people swear by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still working my way down the edible
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a transdermal patch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you tried one of those yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend who did in an effort to
treat fibromyalgia with a CBD patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said it worked, but not as well as
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she really likes, she's got a CBD oil
cartridge for her vape pen that she
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for fibromyalgia myself used to be on
Lyrica.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 9,000 side effects on the
commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all smiling and talking about
anal drainage and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, this is one of the drugs
that I got rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it started using the concentrates on
a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: From medicine that myself and the Garden
of Weedon produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lyrica has gone out of your diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of things that Spence and I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you hear that, Spenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you hear that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lyrica, methadone, solmus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All out of the, no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this may be too much,
but a while back when I'd go visit you,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes you'd be fucking out of it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lately you've been sharp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been Douglas again, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is cool to be yourself again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not under a haze of medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find the remote now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find your phone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want the remote as much now
because you want to go out and do
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got energy again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got mobility again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you guys could see the look on
Doug's face.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's sincere as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not bullshitting you at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pain is a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just dials back every other part of
your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a tiny, tiny boo-boo on my finger
and it's been fucking up my whole week.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a tiny boo-boo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could imagine, I mean, I've got some
pain, but I can imagine having like hip
[SPEAKER_03]: pain at your age.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, God damn, I'm going to feel like I'm
falling apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just like, when my knees
really start throbbing, it's not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: knee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the muscles on either side of it
tense up trying to protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you walk a little funny trying to
protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the end of the day, everything
below your nipples is sore because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to keep your knee from being really
sore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then living like that for weeks and
months on end, you just become exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after years, you start walking
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start living different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects you greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can't think of anything else
except pain, when it's like a high note
[SPEAKER_01]: right between your ears, and that's all
that you can do is hear that scream that
[SPEAKER_01]: your mind is giving, hey, we're hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It changes it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not enough you can do at that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just, you gotta fucking
live with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curl up and bite the bullet until
something you can do to give some relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes heat, sometimes cold,
sometimes pharmaceutical medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people go to alcohol for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we've seen since the beginning
of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have always, I remember my
grandparents would talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd take their shot and go,
that's our medicine for the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of their lives, however,
they wished it, at least that's what they
[SPEAKER_01]: told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that they wished they had quit that
earlier in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons I stopped
earlier in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you did, because I like the way
you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure we'd get along if you drank.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you wouldn't like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody would like me if I drank.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so much alike, Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so much alike.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're such good bros.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that I was a lot like you were
when I drank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're a lot like each other that we
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fist bump, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's one more way of consumption
that I can think of that we have not
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about that I have tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's looking at me like the lube,
bro, the lube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work at a dispensary and I got some
lube, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called EVOS, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of different companies
that make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aria is the main one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we carry EVOS.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, then it's EVOS because I got it from
the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free sample day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get high at all from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Doug's looking at me like that
kind of lube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude, that kind of lube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the nice thing about topicals is
there's not an intoxication with them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a medical effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the instructions said like spray three
to four sprays on her.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went with like eight because,
you know, double up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just and it wasn't spraying that
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like spraying it on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I totally had sex with this chick
and it felt warm and tingly and like hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like hotter than normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The temperature was higher and it took a
little more effort to finish up,
[SPEAKER_03]: to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had to like wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, OK, let me let me try a little
harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did a big review of this on a
previous show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we kind of did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also did a review of what happens
when I smoke too much CBD and I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: finish up at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the base substance of the spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they infuse it with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just I pretty much think they put
coconut oil in a crock pot and throw a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of bud in there and then strain out
the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I really think they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would not be surprised to find that that's
the recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I sprayed some in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to taste it and I was like,
this is just coconut oil with weed in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ingredients are coconut oil and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two products Jeff is highly familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm a hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at all about the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks live on coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for everything, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your hands are all sticky and you can't
get the resin off your hands from
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming, a little bit of coconut oil and
take that shit right off real quick.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: A million and one uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first one I'll tell you about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the other ones you don't even want
to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to start wrapping up this
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to do it earlier, but we've got so
much shit to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've covered all ways that I'm
familiar with consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did touch on on children about people
coming here and we kind of talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: that a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would just like to make a
quick point because I know someone who has
[SPEAKER_01]: a special needs child seizures multiple
times throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally was able to get medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And has changed their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hundred and eighty degrees around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you don't believe in this
stuff, you need to come and see what it
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're worried about the children,
worry about the ones that need this
[SPEAKER_01]: medication and get it because it's made
this not just this child's life much
[SPEAKER_01]: happier, enjoyable, productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've ever been a caregiver of
someone who suffers from something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize that that ripple expands out
there far and when you give relief to the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that everyone cares so much about,
that ripple expands and gives relief to
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that cares about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a family moving here with a kid
looking for CBD oil or if you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: moving here looking for CBD oil,
take your time to hunt down legit
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of places we or Jeff
talked about a news article recently that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's hemp extract oil being sent from
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can buy it online and have it
shipped to you, it's not the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it outside of a dispensary,
you have to be standing in in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 50-50 chance it's not the real
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky and you live in another
state that has a really solid medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana program and lab testing for
cannabinoids is required, you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get the lab test right there with
your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check and see what you're buying
right there in the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't be a little sketched out,
that you're buying stuff from a store that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't come with that, that should be
standard now with legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, if they don't have the lab
test, they're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's legal product in Colorado,
you have to have it lab tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the store clerk tells you they don't
have the lab test, they're lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't want you to see something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want you to see that it's 13%
THC or whatever, or they're being lazy and
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's standard information now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to find CBD meds in a
range of ratios with THC, anywhere from
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 to 1 CBD to THC to 1 to 1 and 2 to 1
THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be a good selection available
to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to take the time to find it
from a legitimate dealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate seeing people come in here looking
for what we've got and finding stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legitimate dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The word dealer in there made that a funny
ass sentence in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at Doug like, did you catch that
at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said legitimate dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have dealers anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legitimate retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Storefront.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your legitimate MMC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: MIPS number.
[SPEAKER_03]: MIPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure it's got a MIPS number and an
OPC number.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have a lot of shit written on
the container.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way more than you're going to want to
read, but read it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read those labels once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out, see what's going on at the end
of the cannabis that you're buying from
[SPEAKER_03]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much interesting shit on the
labels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab some of the pamphlets from the front
too sometimes where they got those like
[SPEAKER_03]: informative brochures that tell you about
what certain cannabinoids do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inform yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay informed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how people like, you know so much
about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just read some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go to a magic weed school.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait a minute.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this time I think we're serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody got any other methods of
consumption?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody went blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any shout outs or anything you want to
give?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you guys follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at Nemopunk15.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to party it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not exactly sure what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to invite six or eight people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put about five microphones
out on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get down and have a good
ass time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play music.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to dance around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be joyous stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the way to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to be.

they'll go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely worth going back through.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of good info in this show.

of life.

must bow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's live like a savior from a blind soul

[SPEAKER_00]: Like a savior from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving a life, soul and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Handing each other's arms so the wicked
must bow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Handing each other's arms so the wicked
must bow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Handing each other's arms so the wicked
must bow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neighbor, love, be neighbor.

[SPEAKER_00]: Not a stone to be left in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a stone to be left unseen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a stone in the roots of our trees.
