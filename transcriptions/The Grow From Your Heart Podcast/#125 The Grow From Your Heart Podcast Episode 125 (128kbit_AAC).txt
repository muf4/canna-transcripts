[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode number 125 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat Kuhn and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Mystic Roots is going on tour
this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please support that tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out mysticroots.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow them on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will definitely be advertising the
Colorado dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at the Colorado Spring Show with
the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait to get down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see your smiling face there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to start off a podcast like this,
but it has happened again, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lost a dear friend, my good friend
Mr. Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I should say this full
name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, you are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over a week now and I'm still
flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't adjusted to you not being
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is dedicated to my good
friend Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll always love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friends, please quit dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shout out to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to send a huge thank you
to our friend Lindsay who co-hosted the
[SPEAKER_00]: last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, I didn't tell you thank you
before you left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not tell you thank you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for doing a kick-ass job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you sounded like a total
dork in a comment on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not sound like a total dork.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sounded like a total badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are welcome back on the show anytime
you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent you a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what's up with that after I
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, come back on the show,
Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for helping me put together a great
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not have done that show without
both of your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, much respect, and big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do a couple of grow questions,
but I want to start off by reading some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments that I have got here on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually pulling up those comments
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling up the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave a comment on the
podcast, all you got to do is go to
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
type in Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring up the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down to the bottom, click on podcast,
click on the icon that shows my face and
[SPEAKER_00]: the title, and then there will be an area
where it says details, ratings and reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: and related.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is click on ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I just clicked and I can see
all of your reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and read.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got three new comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go read all three of these new
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kick down this music,
and the first comment says... Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't scroll down far enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that seemed weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first comment says, it's from our
friend Jay Jeslik Veda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said that wrong, but I really
tried to say it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a five-star rating also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man, for great teaching and your
great attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned a ton, and I hope you can
continue your great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 113 is amazing, by the way,
and I'm sure it will help me more than I
[SPEAKER_00]: can now foresee once I have those
checklists set up for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, old man John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey John, I'm glad episode 113 helped you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that Grow Room checklist is going
to come in handy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done episodes about planning your
Grow Room, and I've done episodes about
[SPEAKER_00]: building your Grow Room, and I've done an
episode about planning a perpetual grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: a perpetual harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you go back and listen to those
episodes, they were really compound with
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 113, and you will have a great
start to growing your own cannabis when
[SPEAKER_00]: the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Jay Jeslik Veda,
or old man John, as he signed the email or
[SPEAKER_00]: the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five-star review,
and thanks for the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one comes from my buddy Rasta
Ralph 719.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dreadlock brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for leaving a comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me a five-star rating,
and he says mad props.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment says, thanks for all you do,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ralph, thanks for growing out my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a badass dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a Rasta, and most of all,
thanks for the support on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five-star comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one more comment, and it says
top shelf, homie, and this person gave us
[SPEAKER_00]: another five-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the review came today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first podcast I've ever
listened to, and I'm hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listened to 21 episodes in two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like you never turned off the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet my voice is embedded in your head by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 episodes in two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoked on all the new info I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great info and good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The homie Spencer turned me on to your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always gives me good info, and glad to
have found another source of great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love learning new things about this
incredible plant slash medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to listening to all of them
and all the new stuff you put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One love, homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, big shout out to Weed B Buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed B Buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed B Buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how you said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed B Buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge shout out for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge shout out for the five-star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, huge shout out to Spencer for
introducing people to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all of the new iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank everybody that left a
comment, the old comments and the new
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got quite a few comments up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 31 five-star reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have any reviews that did not
get five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be cool if you go to iTunes,
throw up a five-star rating, give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the show,
and I will read your comment on a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of emails now that I
would like to quickly read so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: move on into some grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get these emails up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm not sure if you guys want me
to say your actual names or email
[SPEAKER_00]: addresses or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to remember to not do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I take too many dads and I blurt
out people's names and shit, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do our best to not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first email was sent to me with the
subject, love the podcast, and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for a cool podcast that
nerds out on growing and the G-W-Y-H
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, that's the G-F-Y-H, you're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow with your heart is what I think you
meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: G-F-Y-H podcast is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a bunch of podcasts and yours
is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been an underground grower for the
last decade, but just got my med license
[SPEAKER_00]: up here in the Northwest about two years
ago, and this whole legal cannabis world
[SPEAKER_00]: blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to some growers conferences,
but I don't know if I'll ever be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the 411 from Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm completely self-taught hydro grower
who learned from trial and error,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the master class and the way Jeff lays
out info is magnificent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much just from the few
episodes I've had time to catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you guys keep it up as it's
a tremendous service to the other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of email is what makes all of my
effort to do this show worth my time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good to hear people say that I'm
laying out the information in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can understand it because that was my
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what prompted me to do this
podcast was reading things on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: in forums where people are trusting grow
advice and people were giving terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty false advice that were going to
cause more problems or they were giving
[SPEAKER_00]: advice that were simply based on product
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, you've got spider mites,
buy this product, but then all you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be doing is buying that product
for the rest of your grow career.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to eliminate the mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to be chasing them down
with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it'd be wiser to come on here
and teach you how to get rid of those damn
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, how to fix your room, understand
where the mites are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that you understand and
appreciate the way I'm laying things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you said was that my podcast is
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, but I'm not in
competition with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the other shows out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I listen to some of them because
I like to hear what's going on and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to gain the other info, but I'm really not
in any competition with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do appreciate hearing that you think
I'm the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were a podcast award or something
and you chose to give it to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely would not decline that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that huge compliment and
thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to pull up another
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, good morning, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sent a big thanks your way on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking notes to set up my first
professional room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked to me into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a specific question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an 11 by 11 room, how much area should
I have for veg room and a flower room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking six by 11 flower and a four
by five veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he shows a little picture here,
how he divided the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an 11 by 11 flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got himself a four by five veg and a
seven by five work area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't really,
I'm not super stoked about is that seven
[SPEAKER_00]: by five work area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not a lot of space to do
work, but what actually are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing in there that you need to take
room from your grow space to dedicate to
[SPEAKER_00]: the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add another foot onto that veg
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a five by five veg area and keep that
six by 11 flower just like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The six by 11 flower is nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to lose too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend hanging two 1000 watt
lights in your six by 11 and maybe 1000
[SPEAKER_00]: watt in your five by five veg is what I
would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that that's what you're going
to do, but if you listen to my perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: grow episode, the one five by five and the
two lights in the six by 11 will really
[SPEAKER_00]: crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to do huge shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd work out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why you want a seven by five
work area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to use that much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly what you're going to be doing is
mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have, I don't know if you plan on
working in the plants in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can work on the plants in the
flower room if you need to top them,
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll be transplanting or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call it a waste,
but it is almost a waste of space to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a work area as opposed to part of
the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work in grow space if it comes
down to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really wanted to, you could
eliminate that workspace and almost add a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nother light with that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could totally do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just read your email and I answered
that and confused you more or helped you
[SPEAKER_00]: out, send me more details and we will
narrow this down and get this room right
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, good job planning a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people actually go and write
that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So props for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for sending me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, let's get into our next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was headlined tinctures and it
says, Jeff, hey man, Floridian here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's not Floridian by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Florida is what I think that
meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I've been listening to your show
just so I can keep tabs on the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and culture in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a smoker, but I respect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect and support the rights of those
who are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this email, but I want to
jump in and say, that's rad because at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the show, I say, if you're just
curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, this is the show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this guy right here is the guy who's
only curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're aiming the show right at him and
it hit him and he's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect bond right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, anyway, I know someone
who is having trouble sleeping and I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: THC tinctures work well for that and fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you direct me to some information
about tincture varieties, dosage and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you know roughly how much an
average bottle costs in the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a show that covers the topic,
I'd love to know which one or perhaps you
[SPEAKER_00]: can talk a little about this in a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says word and signed his not
real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could say your name since you
called yourself Jaydog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Jaydog for sending me an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get my friend Fox to come on the
show and talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox, you were invited on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox just moved near me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to come be on the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about tinctures and help this
guy and his friends out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you about tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked a couple of things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I direct you to some info such as
dosage and potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosage is based on potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you come to Colorado,
you can buy a bottle of tincture that will
[SPEAKER_00]: have the exact potency per dose printed on
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say if you take, it'll probably be
like an ounce or a two ounce bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll say if you drink this whole ounce,
you'll probably consume 250 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a new consumer, I think we
recommend 25 milligrams as the starting
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want 25 milligrams of THC in your body
to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's tincture, you just basically drink
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in a medicine dropper, put it into
some coffee, put it into some juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pour it right down the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like a warm honey kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take 25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take enough tincture that will contain 25
milligrams and wait about 45 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you see any effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, take another 25 milligram
dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always take more tincture,
but you can't undo how much tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: you've taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a tincture high comes on quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it is appropriately dosed,
it can be strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will hit you and you will feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dosage is based on potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say take 25 milligrams at a time
and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be, unless you come to
Colorado or a medical state, it'll be hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to judge the potency of your tincture,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about sativas and indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas would definitely be better for the
sleep, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to put your body to relax
mode, you want some indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want some CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD may help your body relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just make you chill out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend a heavy indica or
something with some CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll definitely help with the sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, also, do you know
roughly how much an average bottle costs
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: The price is going to vary from shop to
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will certainly vary between medical
and recreational facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a medical facility, I think the average
price of an edible, which includes
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures, is going to be around $10 to
$15 per 100 milligrams of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's 100 milligrams of THC in
there, it's probably going to cost you $10
[SPEAKER_00]: to $15.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's 200, expect to spend 20 to 25,
maybe 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting up in the 300
milligrams, look to spend 30 to 45 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the scale that I have seen
it working on that is not hard and fast at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, that is not solid anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 10 bucks for 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a recreational marketplace,
it'll probably be one and a half times
[SPEAKER_00]: that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at 15 to 20 bucks for
your 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at like somewhere between
30 to 50 bucks for a 200 milligram edible
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the recreational facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do have a huge markup because
they know people are coming from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the country, all over the world,
and they will pay the price just to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience and have the access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how much you should expect to
pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get our friend Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Kabuki?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do an episode a little bit more
about tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the tinctures will hit you
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will work to help your friend
get some sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to come to Colorado and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can recommend is full CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is legal nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find CBD that was derived from
cannabis or hemp and is all organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural CBD, you can consume, possess,
you can have CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they don't have THC in them,
you can have CBD products in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are companies that will send CBD to
you in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get anything from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's made in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a reputable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thanks for that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting the show,
Jay Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some good info.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more questions, please feel
free to email them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to help your friend get some
good rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks for trying to get some info
for your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next email comes from, oh,
that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say this guy's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next email is headlined or subjected
aquaponicgrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, hi there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently found your podcast after
someone recommended it to me and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on perfecting cannabis
growing in aquaponics for the past few
[SPEAKER_00]: years and was curious if you have ever had
anyone on the show to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are ever looking for someone to
talk about the differences about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in aquaponics, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking the time to read my
email and I look forward to hearing back
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not very experienced in aquaponics
growing, but I would love to hear what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be on the show,
we can set up maybe a FaceTime interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could do it through Skype or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: FaceTime would be the easiest for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening to this episode and
you sent me the email about aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, please contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will set up a way to get you on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an iPhone or a Mac,
we're golden, all we've got to do is make
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick phone call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people would love to
know about aquaponics growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I don't have any more
information for you on it, but by the
[SPEAKER_00]: looks of it, you've got it all figured
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to mention is this guy's
email said that he learned about the show
[SPEAKER_00]: after someone recommended it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, what I would like for you to do
is recommend my podcast to three of your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, three of them, because only
one of them is going to actually end up
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming a subscriber and a long-time
listener, but tell three people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll tell somebody that smokes
cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll tell somebody that grows
cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you'll tell people that are
afraid of cannabis and need to learn the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth about cannabis and realize that
there's a guy out here that smokes more
[SPEAKER_00]: hash than most people could even imagine
every single day, and I'm able to put
[SPEAKER_00]: together a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a solid career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own multiple companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this podcast can free up some myths
and get people out of the dark ages when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to cannabis mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so introduce three people to my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say,
and I want to thank my friend with his
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponic email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of long, but it goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking the time
out once again and answering my emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is from a guy that I replied to
before, and his name, we've said his name
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the Tri-County Bandit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, thank you very much for taking
time out once again and answering my
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real talk, you're a real person,
dude, and I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for taking up most of the show
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess it's partly my fault for the
long-winded email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try and be brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were explaining to me on the
podcast about phenotypical expressions and
[SPEAKER_00]: my environment, it dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing out different strains
now, and they all seem to be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wondering what the fuck has been
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know pistols are good, but it seems I
get a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see my trikes, which are
there, but it seems like I have to trim
[SPEAKER_00]: the hairs back to see the actual bud mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this be a sign of bad environment or
lacking something therein?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's dank though, Jeff, so I ain't mad,
but the bottom of my jars are just loaded
[SPEAKER_00]: with hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can my trimming be really shitty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get this problem, or have you ever
known anyone who has, and I think maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: has to deal with the humidity maybe,
as Florida gets 95% most of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I could be wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear that future podcast on
selecting a male for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks again for giving a shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your input on my eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not vegan or shit, man, but I'm not
even a vegetarian, but I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: change my habits, and I've noticed that on
the weeks where I have salads and water,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would love to hear about some good recipes
if you got some, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, I hear it if you're not the Susie
Homemaker type, so you're not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: give me recipes, but let me know what's on
Ross and Jeff's weekly menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never really met any vegans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only heard about them on the radio and
TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine what you would do without
meat or eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't eat eggs either, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff got really baked and listened to the
show like twice, stoned again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wrote this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much for keeping it brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not have to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, Tri County Bandit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole damn email made it to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up, and I will answer some of
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, your buds are airy because it's too
hot, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your buds are getting airy and
fluffy because it's too hot and too humid
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to give it some more cool air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly back the lights up from the
plants a little bit and lower the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're growing indoors or
outdoors, but you need lower humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably some more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool those plants off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about in the summer when it gets
real hot, your plants are puffing out
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're trying to get off of each
other so that they aren't like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't... All right, this is the only
way I can describe it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summertime, your balls hang real
low because it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your balls don't want to be up by your
body because it's all hot and sweaty
[SPEAKER_00]: there, so they try to creep away from your
body a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyxes are trying to get away from
each other because it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting sweaty on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them some cool space, cool it
down, and then they'll get nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice what happens to your nut sack
when it's all cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes boom, and you get a little
coin purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same things happen into your plants,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot believe I just said that on the
podcast, but it's the only way I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the next part, you talk
about eating naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clear that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day per week, I do eat a vegan diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day per week, I do not include any
animals in my eating one day out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day out of the week could be any
random day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make a conscious effort to one day
weekly not eat any animal products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am always a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not consume any flesh of any animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat meat of any kind at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't eat your pizza if it had a
pepperoni on it and you peeled the
[SPEAKER_00]: pepperoni off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a vegan, just a strict vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about some recipes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, bro, I am a terrible vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat a shit ton of pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat a bunch of pasta and I eat a bunch
of salads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bachelor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat on the go most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my diet consists of Thai food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a lot of Pad Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a lot of rice meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat a lot of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat a lot of bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every meal I eat has an avocado
involved in some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink a lot of kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink a lot of coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of stuff that I eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to replace all of my
snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want a sugary snack or a granola bar
or some shit like that, I try to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: it with maybe a small handful of peanuts
and some fruit because sometimes I want
[SPEAKER_00]: some crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to just reach for a candy bar or a
bag of chips or some crap, but now I just
[SPEAKER_00]: eat some pistachios or some almonds and
then some fruit to go with that to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: some sweetness and some flavor and get
that crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of stuff that I like to
snack on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of pasta, lots of fruits and
vegetables, lots of salads, lots of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not the Suzy Ho maker type,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the super chef vegetarian guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said something about eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't fry up eggs and eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have an omelet, but I will eat
something that's got eggs in it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cake or something like that if I do eat,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would eat something like that,
but I'm not just going to go fry up some
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I replied to your rambly ass message with
a bunch of rambles myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made some sense for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you sending me messages
and please send me some more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use my seed company name irey genetics
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a bunch of great cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's all the emails
and comments I've got for you for tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a drink and then we're
going to come back with a couple of really
[SPEAKER_00]: simple grow tips that will really help out
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on for just one second and I will be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back and I'm officially dabbed the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my friends at
Turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I said I was going to come
back and give you guys some grow tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I was talking to a friend
and he was telling me about his garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: he said he was running three or four
different strains and he was running his
[SPEAKER_00]: lights 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are in a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that one strain in the room is
trying to start flowering while they are
[SPEAKER_00]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said he's ran this cut a couple of
times and it's done it both times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was freaking out, very curious why
his plants are auto flowering when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things that can make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, from what this guy says,
I feel like his plants are root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your plants get root bound,
that means that the roots have filled up
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire soil area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more space in the container for
roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant is growing, the roots are
pressing up against themselves and that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant knows my container is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere for me to stretch out my
legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real thing that a cannabis plant
can do at that point is flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to create buds, it wants to make
calyxes or pistols or pollen so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can breed and continue on the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant goes into flower mode to
protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the plant's job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, oh shit, I could die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think his plants are getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root bound plants will show signs of auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't up pot them or fix the
problem, they will go into full flower on
[SPEAKER_00]: you and you won't be able to stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I think may be causing
these plants to go root bound or plants
[SPEAKER_00]: could go root bound from this is a lack of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I noticed that if a plant
is not getting enough light at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom area, that's where it will start to
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your very bottom branches will start
showing calyx pistols popping up early or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're popping up early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't be there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As probably because the lower part of that
plant is not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the leaves up top or the plants
next door are blocking out the light and
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant is going to auto flower because
it's not getting light and it's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect itself once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of thing is way more common if
you're using like T5s or T8s or
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescents or maybe LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using gavitas, you won't see as
much auto flower from lack of light as you
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the smaller compact fluorescents
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the problem could be lack of
light or another thing that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: possible is not a proper light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants flower based on photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant has got what it's called a
critical photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will actually begin to flower
under 14 hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to reduce it to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why outdoors you see some plants
starting to flower before our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle gets to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a critical period on your
plants and some plants will flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also if you stress plants, they will start
to flower on you because they know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main three causes of an auto flower
based flowering plant that is not meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower are root bound, not enough
light, and maybe not a correct photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period for that particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would always check is
to make sure your plant's not root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is, all you've got to do is put it
into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that much of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're starting to flower, I usually
try not to transplant plants during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase because that can really
shock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're severely root bound,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it because your plant will
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to spend some energy stretching
out its roots, but it'll be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a bigger plant, you'll get a
better quality product if you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be extra careful not to stress out
your plant and disrupt those exposed roots
[SPEAKER_00]: too much when you're doing the up pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's enough for that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question that a friend brought
to me was, why are these plants not
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, these plants have been in this
garden for 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still airy, they're still fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyxes are not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are not amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistils have not gotten orange yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more time to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of goes back to earlier when
I was talking about the critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that flower for a long time are
usually from a more tropical climate
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere near the equator, so they get
longer days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants are expecting the season
to only change by about an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would recommend to make these
plants speed up their flowering process is
[SPEAKER_00]: around week nine or 10, start reducing the
timer on your daylight cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of going 12-12, maybe start
going to like 11 hours and 30 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just start working it down until
finally you're down at like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those plants will really start to
speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make the plants get more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make the trichomes start to turn
amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will know that winter is
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing changes in that room,
those plants will not change because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just used to being out by the
equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to being in the jungle
somewhere where it's sunshiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting all kinds of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not ready for the time to
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is all of the
episode I've got for you this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been going on for a long
time by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 30-minute episode already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions off of what I
just said, please send me an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to read more messages,
more comments on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate the listener
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to record another episode with
our good buddy, White Mike, pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get that out to you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a product you'd like me to
review, or if you'd like to sponsor the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, all you got to do is send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been going on for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to start coughing and my throat
is super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet, sweet, your honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh gift stone to it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still just here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still just here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brave, brave man.
Just like home.
Just like home.
