[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of George
Washington OG batter from my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, it says this product
contains 66.7% THC and 79.3% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a fresh smell right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, this smells like dank OG
Kush with a hint of health food store in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound crazy to some people,
but if you've ever walked into that hippie
[SPEAKER_00]: health food store in your neighborhood,
it's got that very specific smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the George Washington has the OG
Kush plus health food store.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can for sure mention is it has
given me tremendous cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I dab this, I get fucking
wicked heavy cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also get heavy, heavy eyes and nice
and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really enjoying the George Washington
OG batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this quick Thursday episode,
I'm going to read listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of our friends who support
[SPEAKER_00]: the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with the big giant Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out a fist bump and a bong rip to my
buddy Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pass a big fat joint over to my
buddy Cess Burton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, The Corporate
Rebel.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast, a bong rip and a dab to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big high five and a fist bump
over to Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to send a shout out to my
friend Cosmo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll up a big old fat joint and pass
it over to my buddy Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Grow From Your Heart high
five to my friend Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
let's pack up a fresh bowl for my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out and big thank you to
everybody who supports the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you need to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes or in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers most of the business
for the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the emails, let's do a
quick garden update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to update you what's happening in
the Eyrie Genetics Breeding Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, if you've been following
along, you know that I recently pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you heard the episode where I
sounded like I just snorted a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen because I basically did.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face was filled with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes were itchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose is runny.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat felt weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was coated in pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take several showers to get that
stuff off of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have got a successfully
pollinated garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I used the King Solomon male to
pollinate a bunch of my favorite females
[SPEAKER_00]: to replenish and restock a bunch of the
popular Eyrie Genetics stuff that moves
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did make one or two more new crosses
in that room in that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did put the Mach 1 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Mach 1 from Capulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does appear to have made several seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the Mach in another run and
it only made very few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does appear that I've made more seed
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I cannot be certain until it is
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fairly excited to have more Mach 1
to arise seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also excited for that other secret
cross that is in there that has never been
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by King Solomon before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also acquired a new grow space
where I hung up two LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend at Black Sale
for the two Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any plants to put under them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grow space is not running just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as it is going, I will give
you guys updates on my progress test
[SPEAKER_00]: running LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been growing with HID lights for
the majority of my grow career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played with some T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've experimented with mainly metal
halides and high pressure sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really prefer the Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was given two Canon LEDs and I feel
like they are going to work perfectly in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the lights out of the box and I
plugged them in and they are some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brightest lights I have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know brightness isn't everything,
but they made me squint and I spend a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of time around grow lights and I noticed
that they are ridiculously bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will let you know how the pollinated
room goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will let you know how the Mach 1
pollination goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know how many seeds I get
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also let you know how I feel
about the LEDs once I start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that's what's going on in my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all of the updates to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has a cannabis
culture or a cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: question, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to mention my name if this so
happens to make it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Thor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I found your podcast
through the Dude Grows podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have to say that your show is my
favorite and I listen to all of your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the content and
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that the Dude Grows show is
spreading the good word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they are getting me new followers,
let me talk about them for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you are following the Dude Grows
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great folks, good people,
very good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like my show, you will like the
Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a click.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friend Thor for
finding us through the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, you are very welcome for all of
the content and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I need a little help
with my grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my second grow and I'm growing in
a four by six tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four inch carbon filter and fan
hooked up above my tent inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a six inch inline fan for
bringing air into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two fans on the inside and my light
is a, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 watt spectrum keying LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures stay around 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get that a little bit lower if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says RH stays around 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work for part of your flower
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to work on VPD a little bit,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to work for you for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am steadily trying to upgrade
as I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I'm looking into RO filters
because I'm having to go fill up water
[SPEAKER_00]: jugs three times a week at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any water suggestions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have hard water where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, does my tent sound efficient enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things I should start
looking into investing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I'd like to run CO2 when I get
everything else dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also using Fox Farms ocean forest soil
with advanced nutrients, bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any good recommendations on
soil and nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any information you can throw at me will
be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the bad ass content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers buddy from Thor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thor, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go over here really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's address the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fox Farm ocean forest soil will be
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer cocoa in my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add some amendments to that cocoa,
some perlite and some persilite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you know that I would recommend
either Veg Bloom or New Millennium
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you've probably spent a
whole lot of money on those advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when those run out, maybe consider
replacing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some New Millennium products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe work your way toward using the Veg
Bloom line of powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe listen to my mix episode and use
the combination that I've suggested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of your tent setup makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much light you're getting
from that 400 watt spectrum king.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's enough light for
that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would read what the manufacturer
suggested on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would research the PPFD of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the light is sufficient,
it sounds like most of your room makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that does stand out to me is you
say you've got a four inch fan and a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter removing air from the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you have got a six inch fan
pushing air into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could possibly potentially happen is
you may be moving more air into that tent
[SPEAKER_00]: than you are pulling out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is going to make the air come from
the cracks and gaps in that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the zipper is, where the seams are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get air escaping from the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air will not pass through the carbon
filter and it will be odoriferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will smell like ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will smell like your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I understand this correctly,
you have got a four inch fan removing air
[SPEAKER_00]: and a six inch fan pushing air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would swap those or simply turn off the
six inch fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that four inch fan is actually
exhausting air from the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will create enough displacement of air
and it will bring fresh air in through
[SPEAKER_00]: that hole where you've got your six inch
fan blowing air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much air goes out will have to be
brought in and it will happen naturally by
[SPEAKER_00]: air displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the main thing that stood out
when you described your grow to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you are pushing more air in than
you are pulling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a balloon type
environment in your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tent will swell up and then what will
happen is that air will escape through the
[SPEAKER_00]: zipper, through the seams, through all of
the other ports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got other ports for other ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got other flaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna swell it up and air is going
to come out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather see negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather see all of the air being
sucked through the carbon filter and then
[SPEAKER_00]: up and out to where the walls of the tent
kind of cave in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know that all of the air that
is passing out of that tent has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through my carbon filter and nobody is
going to smell my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main thing that stands out to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get to the main part of your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were asking about RO filters because
you've been driving to Walmart to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: water jugs three times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that is getting tiresome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that is not convenient and I'm
sure it's starting to look a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's figure out a way to keep you out
of Walmart three times a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: filling up those jugs, looking like you've
probably got to grow somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you have got hard water in your
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tested the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked at the municipal water
support from your water company in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area?
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you everything that is in
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you taken a PPM meter or an EC meter
and stuck it in your water after it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the tap to see what is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to tell you what's in
there, but it will tell you how much is in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you checked the pH of that water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious what is coming out of
your tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have discovered in most cases,
if the water is consumable by most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water should be okay for your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand and I agree that we do
like to have a lot of control over what
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into our plants and having control
over the water is a big advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to go with an RO system
for your home, that is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does create a little bit of waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology for RO machines has come a long
way and the amount of waste has greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: been reduced compared to what it used to
be when we were first using RO in our
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO is a great way to ensure you have got
clean, neutral water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a great way to know exactly what
is going into your nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, however, make it a little more
challenging to stabilize the pH of your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that an RO system is probably
overkill in most home grow environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing hydroponically or if
you were growing in cocoa, I may consider
[SPEAKER_00]: RO in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most environments, I think if you
really want to filter your water,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big boy filter will be sufficient for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not create a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does filter in a time and a timely
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That RO machine will take a very long time
to clean the amount of water you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a big boy filter or a small boy
filter will efficiently and effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: clean your water for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in a soil-less mix environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using Fox Farms Ocean Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have a buffer zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in that soil-less mix allows you a
little bit more room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were in hydroponics or cocoa,
I may consider recommending the RO machine
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really believe that in most cases,
that big boy, that small boy filter will
[SPEAKER_00]: filter the water probably more than
efficiently for what you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: in your home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up big boy filters in most of my
commercial environments because I find
[SPEAKER_00]: that the RO water is more wasteful than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the big boy filters,
they are quicker and they clean more than
[SPEAKER_00]: what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't create that excessive
wastewater, which I find to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still pay for that water, even though
it gets sent out of waste water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came through the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to pay for it, even though we
cleaned it, flushed it down the toilet,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that a big boy filter or a
small boy filter would work efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more affordable to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more affordable to set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to waste nearly as
much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that it will clean the
water perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next detail you mentioned is that
you would like to run CO2 once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be one of the last things
that you're going to add I would make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get all of your grow technique
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure that you get the
appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got enough light in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know if that 400 watt LED
is enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do the research on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your water dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your nutrients dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your genetics dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you're ready for CO2,
you've got to think about you are now
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting all of the air right out of that
tent continuously because we're trying not
[SPEAKER_00]: to get humidity problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying not to get stagnant air,
trying not to get temperature problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to introduce CO2,
how are you going to keep the CO2 flowing
[SPEAKER_00]: through that tent without wasting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to seal up the room
in which the tent is in and then CO2 the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and then pump the CO2 in and out of
that tent continuously is what I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I will recommend is that you
add some sort of a monitor so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pay better attention to your temperature
and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: 82 is kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in North America, it is the
winter, which means when the summer comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get 5 to 10 degrees hotter
in that grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get prepared now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start working on cooling that room
so we don't roast those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to pay more attention
to the temperature and the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 40% relative humidity is acceptable
in most cases, but throughout flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout veg, throughout different parts
of the cycle, you may want higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want a monitor and the
appropriate equipment to adjust those
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters when they are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people set up a grow room and
they think, cool, this is set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to survive through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they forget that if you live
somewhere like Colorado and the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, it gets 110, 112 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the winter it gets 12 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to set up different setups for
different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we are entering the time of
the year where I've got to start preparing
[SPEAKER_00]: for the warm season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is March right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As April creeps in, we'll get one or two
last snow storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when those snow storms go away,
it'll start getting real warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kapow, it gets super hot for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will get super humid because we
get a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after all that rain, we get a
bunch of snow and it will be cold as fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: again for four or five, maybe six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am prepared for that because I've
been doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see I watch outside, I watch the
sky, pay attention to the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to adjust a lot of things for
seasonal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, but I've been doing it
for a while so I can foresee it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of I can predict that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of got routines and rhythms and
I know exactly what to do when the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: and when the summer come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody should keep that in mind when
they are setting up their grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're building a tent, it may be the
perfect environment in there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens in six months when the
seasons are the complete opposite?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend, I think I answered
your question more than sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Thor, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow up questions,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more email in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hi, I've been listening to your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great content and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you for starting off
with compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing around with soil builds
in the sense that I'll do a run with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same beans and grow them out and soils
that I build using different quantities of
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the soil cook off so it's not too
hot and that it's stable enough for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to express themselves as they see
fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the idea behind building a super
soil or maybe like a no till type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is creating a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting all of the appropriate
amendments together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting it in a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got I don't know what their
sources are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't gotten that far, but they have
got a source of nitrogen, a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, a source of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got all the macro, all the
micronutrients in here from natural
[SPEAKER_00]: organic sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil does what we call cook for a
period of time, which breaks down all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those amendments and makes them
bioavailable to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put the plants in this soil and we
don't have to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have to do is water them because
everything is in the soil naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: they eat at their own will.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener believes that this will
allow the plants to express themselves as
[SPEAKER_00]: they see fit because we are not force
feeding them chelated buffered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common and very realistic
approach to cannabis growing and I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: wait to get further into this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, Indulging in this
practice has made me aware of something
[SPEAKER_00]: which brings me to my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different soil compositions create what
seem like different terpene profiles in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plants grown in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this observation is true, then my
question is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does one find the plant's truest
expression with today's plants that have
[SPEAKER_00]: such varied genetic backgrounds because of
extensive cross breeding, inbreeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: back crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a soil of its origin seems
imposing and impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, my friend, is the magic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we are all searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the cannabis growers never ending
quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you were talking about is what I call
dialing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to dial in, you want to dial in
your soil mix so that that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: represents itself and expresses itself to
its fullest potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the biggest goal for a cannabis
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you are good at getting all the
basics down, that is where your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get this plant to be the best
plant it can be?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how we get cup winning cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how we get award winning cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how we get very helpful medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with passion like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, my friend, is the never ending quest
is to get that plant dialed in to
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with more of the
email and then I really want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but there's more that I want to
cover before I get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a soil of its origin seems
imposing and impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, with all of the cross breeding,
you can get a plant that's got Afghani and
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai and Mexican genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I know what kind of soil to put
that in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not from an Afghan region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't build that soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know what to put in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I do get that right,
how do I even know that the phenotype I
[SPEAKER_00]: put in there is going to like that mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, every grow I wonder
what the plants could have expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a deep rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's why I want to cover all of
this before I get rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question, maybe you could dispel
some of the myths surrounding long term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's not even unpack that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the part about dialing in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking that different amendments
will absolutely give us different colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: different aromas, different flavors,
different terpene profiles, different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make very many different variables
in the final outcome of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, everything above the soil will have
a similar or different effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights may change how your plants
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the opportunity to see my seeds
grown under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see them under HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see them under ceramic metal
halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see them under makeshift ghetto
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to see how those plants express
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do see variation from all of those
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is the soil and the medium
going to make a difference, but the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: will make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your VPD and overall environment
will make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a little drier in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your grow room a little more humid or a
little warmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are going to make a
difference in how this plant expresses
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds to me like you are at the stage
of the game where you want to find how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this plant express itself perfectly
with your soil mix, which is a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to whip up a batch of soil and
say, that is the magic mix right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plant is going to do everything it
needs to do it just the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be top shelf, A grade,
cup winning, magical medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I admire you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the way that I feel like we get to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did state that you were growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to grow from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, start with your favorite batch
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a basic phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's narrow it down to one phenotype
that works beautifully well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that is your favorite out of that
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You choose what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take what works best for you in your
grow, in your pipe, in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose the phenotype that is your
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to develop a relationship
with that plant and that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way we can create any sort of
scientific outcome is by doing very
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take six clones of the same plant
and put them all in different soil and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those six different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's document very well what's in pot A,
what's in pot B.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we eliminate variables, it makes it
much easier to dial in to perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by eliminating the variable of
different plants in the room, that now
[SPEAKER_00]: allows us to dial in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I hate to break it to you,
no two plants are going to be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: happy in the same soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to dream that we can whip up some
magic soil that's going to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe that that is going to be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that having cannabis plants is like
having girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to learn all of their little
quirks, all of their little niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn all of the details
that make them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also got to learn all of the
details that piss them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to avoid all of those things
that piss them off and you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: amplify all of the things that make them
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've got a spreadsheet and a
notebook and a couple of friends helping
[SPEAKER_00]: you out, it is very hard to dial in more
than one girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not going to keep her happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to focus and figure out what
she needs and do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cannabis garden is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do this with one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need four, five, six, maybe 10 or
20 grows with the same plant to dial it to
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like that is your goal is to
get a plant to express itself to its full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, which would be a perfect grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, my recommendation is finding one
clone that works beautifully for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find one environment that you're going to
do this experiment in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mix up four or five different types
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many pots you can put in that room
to flower, mix up that many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take very good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, label pot A, pot B or pot 1 through
6, however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mark down what was in each pot very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow your plants all in the same
environment so it is scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only acceptable variable in this
experiment is the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only thing that should change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not change lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not change pot sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not change frequency of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't top one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lollipop one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do something to one plant,
do it to every plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them all equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay close attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot, a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take excessive notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take excessive photos if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use your grower intuition and your
grower knowledge and grower skills to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine which soil is working best for
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is where the fun part comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dry, cure, harvest, smoke those
plants, you and I may completely disagree
[SPEAKER_00]: on which one was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the magic of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get that soil perfect and you may
smoke it and you'll say, that's exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I may smoke sample B that you
rejected and I'll go, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a frustrating struggle,
but it is a fun struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfection is all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're trying to get this plant to
express itself to its fullest potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the most turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the most pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the most potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the most colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the most flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the best buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the best photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I admire that, but keep in mind that
best is a very relative word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my opinion of best, your opinion of
best could be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you reach your goal,
that is what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend, you are going to have to mix
up a bunch of batches of soil and I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend running the same clone over and
over in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get very familiar with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get very familiar with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you have got that plant and that
soil dialed in, that's when I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend putting some other clones in
that mix and see how they react and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: that mix is perfect for those plants as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then see how you need to adjust that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can start doing some science and
find out the happy medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe you can have the magic soil in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I think it is going to be
different soil for every plant and for
[SPEAKER_00]: every single phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't feel alone, my friend,
because you are on the quest that every
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced grower reaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find out how to make those
plants express their truest potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I admire you for going down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep taking notes and don't let yourself
become a mad scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're on a great path.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could dispel some of the myths
surrounding long-term storage of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always backpacked mine and kept them
in an airtight waterproof case in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work, but I do notice older
seeds become less viable, less vigorous in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, as a breeder, how would you store
your beans for long periods of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to pop some of your beans someday
when time allows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks from Izer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about seed storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big factor in how I decide to store my
seeds is how long I intend to keep those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I plan to remove them and show them
to friends or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in most cases, I prefer to keep them in a
cool, dry, dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, dry, and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat will kind of deactivate them and kill
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat is not good for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It degrades just about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool will kind of keep things in that
suspended animation state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep things alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep things in preservation in a
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend a freezer, although some
people do do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely keep your seeds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any moisture will cause them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about storage and why I
don't like to put some seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator or in containers in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to remove your seeds from
your cold storage frequently, I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: like to put them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them in the safe, put them on a
shelf in the basement where it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently cool and it never gets too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that will be sufficient if
you are the kind of person that wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: show your collection off to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I say this is every time you
move your seeds from cold storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are changing the temperature of the
seed, the packaging, and the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do increase the risk and
opportunity of some type of condensation
[SPEAKER_00]: or moisture making contact with your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we want to change the
temperature once you've got them cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're in the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they fell out of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting in the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting for spring to come to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not take them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep teasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also said I don't prefer to freeze
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find that necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are places that do freeze the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep them in a sealed container
that is airtight and I keep that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: brown paper bag in the bottom of a
refrigerator in the crisper drawer if I
[SPEAKER_00]: intend to keep those seeds for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said as a breeder, how do I store
my seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, my seeds do not stick around
very long, so they are produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are packaged up, and they basically
go to vendors and they are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal seeds are kept in jars,
which are kept sealed airtight,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are kept in a safe, which is in a
very cool area of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a basement in a very back corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That section is always dark and cool back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I trust that those seeds will be safe
stored like that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to germinate seeds that
have been stored in that safe for five to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years and they come out very
successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are accurate in the idea that some
seeds that get older will become less
[SPEAKER_00]: viable and less vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just how nature goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, those things will start to
degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a large quantity,
you should be able to germinate some out
[SPEAKER_00]: of those packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is I don't vacuum seal mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like that's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it kind of crushes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put them in a sealed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that no moisture can get to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put them, again, in the back of
the fridge in the dark or in that safe
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in a cool, dark, dry location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely ever open that safe unless I need
to get seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what I need and I put them back and
I don't handle the seeds more than
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend if you're going to handle
the naked seed itself without packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get your sweat,
your skin oils and crap on the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if those are going out for
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a seed breeder, I do appreciate
that people are buying seeds and storing
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would really recommend is that
you grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best place for a seed is in some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get those seeds going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my new friend, Izer, I hope I covered
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I went real deep on your
soil question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I covered your seed storage
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, keep them dry, dark and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let any moisture get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your seeds should store for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do put them in the freezer or the
refrigerator, leave them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit bringing them out to show your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to show your friends,
just keep them in a safe, keep them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry, airtight Tupperware container and I
think you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and pimps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hoes, friends and foes, smokers and
growers, cannabis activists and space
[SPEAKER_00]: cadets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed this long Thursday
