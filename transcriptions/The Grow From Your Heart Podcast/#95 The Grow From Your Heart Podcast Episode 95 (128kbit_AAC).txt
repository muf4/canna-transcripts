[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is time for episode number 95 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or if you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: someone who's curious about the current
state of cannabis, this, my friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys for joining the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends, and the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots band for allowing me to use their
music on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn down this music.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little bit loud this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have any ads for this show,
but I do want to give a shout out to all
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends that joined me for the reggae
show a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Tuesday, I got to go up to the Fillmore
Auditorium in Denver, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I got to see Morgan Heritage,
Taurus Riley, Stephen Marley, and Damian
[SPEAKER_03]: Marley.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of reggae, lots of good vibes,
lots of love, lots of ganja smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Arnie and Rave for being
great friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They joined me up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a great time at the show,
and also big shout out to Danielle for
[SPEAKER_03]: being a great reggae date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also big shout out to Rasta Stevie.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sometimes you might listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I've got a couple of
things coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, we're going to address an
email that was sent to me from a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to talk about something I said in
the episode about bag seeds, so we will
[SPEAKER_03]: discuss that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I want to read a news article
that just came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article came out on September 16th.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it in the Cannabis Of Course.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article was written by David Magoya
and Ricardo Baca, and the article headline
[SPEAKER_03]: says, Colorado Ag examining pot industry
use of organic term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sub headline says, because marijuana is
illegal under federal law, the use of the
[SPEAKER_03]: term organic is federally regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state licensed cannabis business can't
be certified as organic no matter their
[SPEAKER_03]: practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn up my headphones just a
little bit, and then I will read this
[SPEAKER_03]: article for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Headphones are loud enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mic check, headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking for information inside those
complaints to make a determination on what
[SPEAKER_03]: those next steps are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it consumer fraud?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it criminal?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ag's office would not give more detail
on the scope of the investigation,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a lawyer who represents a marijuana
business contacted by investigators said
[SPEAKER_03]: it appears to have limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: The inquiry includes grow operations,
some with organic in their names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently caught up in Denver quarantines
over pesticide concerns, attorney Sean
[SPEAKER_03]: McAllister said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys, I read that statement a
little bit oddly, but you caught what it
[SPEAKER_03]: said.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ag is ensuring that businesses that
use the word are at least consistent with
[SPEAKER_03]: the concept of organic, McAllister said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because marijuana is illegal under federal
law and the use of the term organic is
[SPEAKER_03]: federally regulated, a licensed cannabis
business cannot be certified as organic no
[SPEAKER_03]: matter its practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: As such, no marijuana businesses in
Colorado can technically use the word in
[SPEAKER_03]: its name or in selling its product,
according to officials and industry
[SPEAKER_03]: insiders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potential fraud penalties under the
Colorado Consumer Protection Act include
[SPEAKER_03]: fines of up to $10,000 per violation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Federal rules say that businesses wrongly
selling a product as organic could face
[SPEAKER_03]: fines of up to $10,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet those rules have not been enforced in
Colorado's marijuana businesses until now.
[SPEAKER_03]: State marijuana license records show that
29 businesses, growers, retailers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and dispensaries use the word organic in
their name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some use a trade name containing the word
organic to market marijuana products or
[SPEAKER_03]: use the term or do use the term in their
advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: A spa check of websites by the Denver Post
found businesses claiming to sell 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: organic cannabis, offering organic
treatments of medical marijuana or use
[SPEAKER_03]: only organic methods to produce their
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some shops describe their product as grown
in organic soil or that they use organic
[SPEAKER_03]: growing techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another website touts certification of
organic standards and testing that mirrors
[SPEAKER_03]: the US Department of Agriculture organic
certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brooke Wise, owner of the Growing Kitchen
in Boulder, said that she's willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: take the risk of labeling her company's
edibles made with certified organic seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and fruits as organic even if the
marijuana in them isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a principle, an ideology that doesn't
belong to anybody, she said, noting her
[SPEAKER_03]: plants would be certified organic if that
existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the list of sacrifices and gambles I
take, organic is definitely on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But River Rock Cannabis in Denver has
backed away from using the term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until recently, the company had been known
as River Rock Organic Medical Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The attorney general sent something saying
that no dispensary can be certified as
[SPEAKER_03]: organic, retail manager Chris Haggerty
said.
[SPEAKER_03]: The company changed signs, stopped handing
out promotional items with the company's
[SPEAKER_03]: name and even stopped selling t-shirts
with the old company name, Haggerty said.
[SPEAKER_03]: A group seeking to have marijuana
certifiable as organic said a system for
[SPEAKER_03]: informing consumers how marijuana is grown
is needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The word organic is being used
inappropriately by people who are using
[SPEAKER_03]: very toxic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no governing agency that is
regulating that, said John Paul Maxfield,
[SPEAKER_03]: co-founder of the Organic Cannabis
Association in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the absence of a body coming through
and branding organic cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: that term can be used by everybody even if
it's not done properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The USDA accredits companies and state
governments to certify any farm as
[SPEAKER_03]: complying with federal organic regulations
for agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_03]: No company may use the term without this
certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana may not be certified organic
under the USDA Organic Regulations,
[SPEAKER_03]: said a USDA spokesman who could not be
named because it's the agency's policy
[SPEAKER_03]: when discussing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana is considered a controlled
substance at the federal level and organic
[SPEAKER_03]: certification is reserved for agricultural
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: The USDA's National Organic Program rules
say companies with organic in their name
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot prominently display it on a product
and cannot use the name at all if it
[SPEAKER_03]: misrepresents that a product has been
certified organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It falls to the Colorado Department of
Agriculture to certify and to credit
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural businesses in the state as
organic, as well as police for
[SPEAKER_03]: inappropriate and illegal uses of the word
on behalf of the USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the state chose to certify marijuana as
organic, it would have to ignore federal
[SPEAKER_03]: rules and that's unlikely, said Mitch
Yerger, director of CDA's Plant Industry
[SPEAKER_03]: Division.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird because we've already ignored
federal rules and we have legalized
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational cannabis, so why wouldn't we
just do it again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state's inquiry came after the Denver
Department of Environmental Health this
[SPEAKER_03]: year quarantined more than 100,000
marijuana plants over pesticide concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: One company, Organic Greens, tested
positive for unapproved pesticides,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because it operates publicly as
natural remedies, the Ag's office allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: it to keep its name, said McAllister,
its attorney.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their actual corporation name is Organic
Greens, but they don't use it in
[SPEAKER_03]: advertising, so they don't publicize
themselves as organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do any advertising as organic,
so nobody's being misled, McAllister said,
[SPEAKER_03]: confirming the company name under Ag
scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: McAllister said the Ag is focusing,
at least in part, on companies that have
[SPEAKER_03]: used pesticides not allowed by the state
for use on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: They understand you can't get federal
certification for the word organic in
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ag's office is not substituting
themselves for a certification agency,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if it's clearly not organic,
if someone's using mallet or Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're also looking for those cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mallet and Eagle 20 are pesticide trade
names whose active ingredients contain
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals the state has not approved for
use on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've said this on a previous episode,
but I was speaking with somebody from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually came to, I'm the master
grower at the spot dispensary,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I had to meet with a department from
the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent two reps down to come talk to
us, and the main rep told me that the main
[SPEAKER_03]: reason that Eagle 20 has been banned from
dispensary uses is because if there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: fire and the Eagle 20 burns, the off
gassing turns into cyanide, and the fire
[SPEAKER_03]: department doesn't want to go into a
building that is filled with the gas of
[SPEAKER_03]: cyanide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's mainly why Eagle 20 has been
banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's completely toxic, but he didn't
even seem to care about the toxicity of
[SPEAKER_03]: the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just wanted to tell me about it turning
into cyanide is why it's been banned from
[SPEAKER_03]: use in commercial grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one more sentence here left,
one more short paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, although no chemical pesticide
can obtain federal approval for use on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, state agriculture officials have
determined which products have labels
[SPEAKER_03]: whose restrictions are so broadly worded
that using them on marijuana would not be
[SPEAKER_03]: a violation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are cracking down on it,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first started in the medical
marijuana world, I was shopping at a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary that had the word organic in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew right away when I looked at the
medicine, when I saw how they grew,
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew there was nothing to do with actual
organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just trying to use the word
organic as a marketing ploy, and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also just to put this out there,
they do require that all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients used in the grow, anything
that was sprayed or fed to the plants does
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be listed on an instruction list
or instruction ingredients list,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, an ingredients list on the
outside of the container.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that shit does have to be listed
on the package that the cannabis or hash
[SPEAKER_03]: is sold in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, let me reach over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the inner packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one doesn't have the ingredients on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the time it's got a few things
written on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you come by cannabis in the state
of Colorado, you'll get a little jar like
[SPEAKER_03]: a childproof jar or whatever they put the
cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll have some ingredients listed on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see things like calcium and
you'll see things like mycos and
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all what was used in the growing of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will also hopefully list any
pesticides that were sprayed on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're cracking down on the name
organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they are also cracking down to make
sure that your shit is organic,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that because there are a lot
of shops serving up doodoo that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell it was not organically grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can taste the fertilizers in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know friends that own hydro shops and I
know friends that are chefs and
[SPEAKER_03]: consultants for dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they go to places that claim to be
running organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they make their order from
the hydro shop or when they set up a
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient schedule with the consultant,
they go with the product that is
[SPEAKER_03]: completely not organic and they don't seem
to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't say anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad now somebody is going to call
them out and make them accountable.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab and a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to address an email
that was sent to us by a listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: About something I said in episode number
90.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hang out for a few seconds and I'll be
right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to let you know,
if you hear a bunch of ruckus in the
[SPEAKER_03]: background there, there are no hostages in
my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a football game happening
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Denver Broncos game and my
neighbors are having a party and I got my
[SPEAKER_03]: window open a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever something happens in the game,
you can hear them either cheer or jeer,
[SPEAKER_03]: whichever way it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you hear the screams, no,
I don't have hostages here in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a football game and people are
going crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few days ago, I received an email
from a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into this email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pulling it up in my phone right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This email is from our friend Justin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, I just listened to episode
90.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I was operating on some incorrect
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and Jesse seemed to feel like herms
are really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told herm seeds were pretty much
feminized seeds since the genetics all
[SPEAKER_03]: came from females.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically we would revedge out plants
after harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then light poison them to make seeds
for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if those progeny from the
seeds would be predisposed to herm in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just explain a little to me
or cover this on the show, I would super
[SPEAKER_03]: duper love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Ross to Jeff from Justin G.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the seeds you're talking about are not
necessarily herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hermaphrodite seeds are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hermaphrodite seeds come from when there
is a female plant in the room that
[SPEAKER_03]: suddenly pops a male flower and that male
flower pollinates the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few seeds happen from that small
pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a big difference in kind of a
hermaphrodite seed and what you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a few notes and wrote a few things
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to kind of try to read this to
you and sound like I'm not reading
[SPEAKER_03]: something to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seeds that you made are made by
stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as there were no males or stray
pollen available to the females,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also the females are solid females,
the seeds produce will be females because
[SPEAKER_03]: of the lack of a Y male chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So technically those won't be herm seeds
if none of the females hermaphrodited and
[SPEAKER_03]: made male flowers that released pollen in
there and they should be feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as none of your female plants
are throwing off bananas or male pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: sacks, you will be making female seeds
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a plant is allowed to flower for too
long, it'll often make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a plant is light stressed, which is
what you guys are doing, then those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: will make seeds and those seeds are
feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another way to make feminized seeds is
Soma takes a plant that is almost
[SPEAKER_03]: finished.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be around week six or seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: For like a nine week plant, he'll take it
around week six or seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he will light a small fire and
put that fire next to the plant to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: feel like it's in a forest fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will heat the shit out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll move the heat around the plant and
kind of freak it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that plant thinks it's in a forest
fire and its panic reaction is to start
[SPEAKER_03]: making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he'll have to give it four to six weeks
from there to finish seeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by week 12, Soma will have a big batch
of feminized S1 seeds that don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: other chromosomes in them except the
chromosomes coming from that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to be basically copying
the plant that you just stressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you are making feminized seeds there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Jesse and I were talking about
hermaphrodite seeds, we were talking more
[SPEAKER_03]: about seeds that were caused by a
hermaphrodite issue in a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say one of your females were to pop a
pollen sack during week seven or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: week six or seven, and that hits another
plant and it pollinates and it makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seed will be kind of questionable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may have hermaphroditic traits,
but it still could be gold is what we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a little bit of difference in
herm seed and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A herm seed is kind of a trait issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're doing is kind of a
manipulation, sort of a stressing and a
[SPEAKER_03]: panic reaction sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage you to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got any extra seeds, man,
I'd love to grow a couple of those and see
[SPEAKER_03]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take some pictures for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that I do that's kind of on
this realm, and this is just because I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to rant about this, it's kind of
what this reminded me of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I breed with plants, I will take my
females and I will put them in the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering room and I will set the timer to
12, 12, and I'll let them flower for about
[SPEAKER_03]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as I see bud set, I will
reverse the timer from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will now have them off from 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: and 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: and they will come on at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: till 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: for about five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after five or six days,
I will put the timer back to the original
[SPEAKER_03]: 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll come on at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: and go off at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll pay real close attention to them
for about a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll fuck with the timer again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn it on for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll just do weird random shit
with my schedules in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll put it back on 12,
12 for a few days and watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they start freaking out real bad,
then I kind of get rid of the plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: can't handle some stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I go light stress testing
because a little bit will tell me what I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes you get curious as a grower
and you want to go through and really
[SPEAKER_03]: pummel a female plant and see what that
bitch can handle before you go putting her
[SPEAKER_03]: into a major breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've actually got a couple of plants
that I can take them to week two and
[SPEAKER_03]: totally reverse the light cycle and it
doesn't piss them off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it a couple of times and they
don't herm out.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if I let those same plants go
long enough, without any light stress,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I let them go too long, they will start
to produce seeds because I've let some
[SPEAKER_03]: strains go up to 80 days, strains that
should only go 60.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've let them go 80 just to see what
happens when you grow as much as we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You end up playing with some things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you learn a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let them go a little bit long just to
see what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was seeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant had by that 20 extra days put
seeds in my plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can do it by light stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it by extending them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to stress test your
females, I kind of just told you how I
[SPEAKER_03]: would do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just fuck with the light cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a breeder, one thing I want to say is
when you grow out those seeds that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making from manipulated plants,
really pay close attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not find the hermaphrodites until
like week eight of a nine week plant or of
[SPEAKER_03]: a 10 week plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shouldn't be there, but you are
making a manipulated seed that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a chance for some weirdness.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I hope that answered your
question in your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and grow those seeds out,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great way to keep yourself
self-sustainable and keep yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: supplied in seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be one of those guys that has seeds
when the apocalypse comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, if you want me to read
one of your emails on the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: all you got to do is send it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love you guys to follow me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just growfromyourheart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all of the social media
interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do try to interact with everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you send me a message, I will try to
respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does take me a little bit sometimes
because I do get a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I've got the iReadGenetics
email account that fills up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my own personal email account
that fills up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I've been doing Periscope videos,
I've been getting a lot more messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things are going a little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, all that
stuff keeps me tied up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been working at the spot doing
quite a few hours every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that limits my time for social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will answer your question,
is what I think I am getting to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please interact with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I think that's,
holy crap, what happened to my throat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez, I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I've got for you for
this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that news article and that email
would take a little bit longer to answer,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I pretty much covered that in 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am putting together the episode about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get more guests to come be
on the show now that it's almost harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: season, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once everybody cuts down, everybody
will be a little bit more available.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be able to get all the growers back
on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Zoom H6, so I'll be able to take
the show on the road now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go a few places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just bought four microphones and four
new cables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be able to take that wherever we
want and go do some recording with a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to open up a lot more
options.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the next episode, I plan to answer
another email that we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to address something that I saw at
a grower's house when I went to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: consultation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that they did in their garden
that I felt the urge to correct them and I
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of gave them some guidance on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be making the same mistakes as
this other guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to share that with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a lot of great stuff planned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'll be back Monday with another
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to sponsor the podcast,
all you got to do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know everything you need to
know about sponsoring the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a product that you would
like me to review, same thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would love to review your products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give you an honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will expose your product to at least
5,000 consumers that are right up your
[SPEAKER_03]: alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a good product,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get it out there for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have something to say, find me on
all the social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys already said that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[SPEAKER_03]: is always and forever archived on
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget, I did put a donation button
on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you feel like the show is worth a
couple of bucks, go to the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on the grow from your heart podcast
tab.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the top right, there's a donation
button.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little PayPal logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never going to charge you for this
podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast will always be free.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show is going to be free.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow from my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it to you from my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you grow from your heart in return.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do feel like making a
contribution, it would definitely be
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just bought the new Zoom H6 partially
with contributions that came into the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to everybody who has made a
contribution in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you guys, now that the show's over,
you can go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Search for grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave me a five star review and type in a
little comment and let me know what you
[SPEAKER_03]: think about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that we want more ratings and
more comments and more reviews is because
[SPEAKER_03]: that makes us more exposed to a larger
audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more likes you get, the more comments
you get, the more Facebook shares you and
[SPEAKER_03]: exposes you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more people that see the show,
the more people will learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: More people will quit spraying shit on
their plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will learn how to look out for
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will learn how to just grow better
cannabis overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody will grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will get the right idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will get a proper education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody will listen to the show
that has never smoked pot before.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll listen to the show and they'll
say, you know what, this guy smokes a gram
[SPEAKER_03]: of hash every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's mostly articulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've got some stoner moments on
this show, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm mostly articulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll say this guy has his shit
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe weed isn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe they'll lighten up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe they'll be on our side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe one day we can legalize
cannabis nationwide and then worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalizing cannabis one click at a time
here at the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I don't have a lot
else to say, so I am going to wrap up the
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I just hit 18,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at 18.1 K on Instagram right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I want to give a huge shout out
to my Ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for listening until next
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys like a big one, like a half a
gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it count.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a fat dab right after you blow it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you love to burn down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found on the grave of King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisdom nearly made him the wisest man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of them won't come fight this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The healing of the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burning the earth so free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they will report police.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take out the mold and pee up a
gutsy of the blood that burned this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you heard in the coffee shop on the
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time they realize it should be
legalized worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, child.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us the strength to advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice of you, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make you feel.
Make you feel.
