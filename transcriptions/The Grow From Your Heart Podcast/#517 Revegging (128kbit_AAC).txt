[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This evening, I've been taking dabs of
Cowboy Kush Full Spectrum Extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of H-A-O-G and Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
earthy, fuel, and leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to agree with the earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fuel is certainly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I am noticing, if I smell this
jar and I pull it away from my face
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, I do get a hint of strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that is coming from the
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let the Stardog flower for just a
little bit too long, it will produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a berry flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that this product
represents that strawberry-watermelon sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I like the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most impressive part about this
package, it is a 4-gram container.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cracked open the jar, it is just
one giant diamond in the middle of the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: with just enough terp sauce around it to
make it delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really impressed with the appearance
of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I love the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you can tell by how chatty I
am that I completely love the buzz of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cowboy Kush Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a lesson on re-vegging our
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you grow a plant that was perfect for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find a winner?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, you don't have a
clone of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really wish you could grow it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a solution for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the option of re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the lesson on re-vegging
our plants, let's do a shout out to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: of our friends who support the show on

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into this grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teased it enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about re-vegging our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the actual process,
let's talk about why we might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-veg a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teased about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may grow a plant from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may grow a plant from clone and you
may realize this is amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant I've been searching for
my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all plants are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all growers are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all grow environments are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find the perfect plant for the grower,
for the room is sometimes a real,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I've got the fucking plant
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that does what I need
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is the one that is doing what I
need financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably grows perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes beautifully for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cures your ailments or it's stacking up
your wallet real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you're working with it,
sometimes you find that perfect plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you realize I didn't take a clone
of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you take a clone of it and the
clones don't root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the clones die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your helper kills the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your cat kills the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happens, but sometimes
we grow the most beautiful plant we've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen and we don't have a clone,
but we really are kicking ourselves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass wishing that we'd done some sort of
preservation so we can grow that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where re-vegging comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-vegging happens at the end of the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start re-vegging around the same
time that I begin flushing a finished
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grow your plants, they're almost
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last 10 to 14 days of the
flowering phase, we should be flushing our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should just be feeding them clean
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are getting ready for the
harvest phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I like to begin the re-veg
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand that what I am about
to say is kind of new and unique to some
[SPEAKER_00]: people and it may freak you out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't want to start your re-veg
process when you begin the flush phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start your re-veg process after
you have harvested the rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just save that plant that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of my instructions will be
basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will catch up when we get to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to focus on the re-veg
phase happening during the flush phase or
[SPEAKER_00]: the last two weeks of the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that is going to tell our plants
that we want it to re-veg is the light
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made these plants flower by reducing
the light to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave that plant a long enough dark
period to make the plant think that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall season and it should go into
flower because the end of its life is
[SPEAKER_00]: near.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are accustomed to living for
one full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get one cycle out of life and then
they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make seeds and those seeds are what
carries on the generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't plan on living more than
one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can trigger our plants into going
into the flowering phase by manipulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the light cycle, we can also trigger these
plants to go back into the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage by manipulating the light cycle the
opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 10 to 14 days before I plan to
harvest my room, I will put my light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: back on an 18 and six light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that may sound alarming to a
lot of new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound alarming to a lot of
experienced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these plants to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want beautiful, fatty, sticky buds with
nice trichomes all over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our main goal for this garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I am telling you to flip your
light cycle back to a veg cycle while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're almost done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are 10 to 14 days away from cutting
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants remember that when we flip
the plants into flower, it took them
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 12 to 15 days before they
started flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to take 10 to 14
days before they start showing you any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference that they are trying to go back
into a vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before these plants get to that,
we're going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increased light period is also going
to make the buds get thicker and fatter
[SPEAKER_00]: and beefier and chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will actually potentially increase
your harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may also potentially speed up your
harvest time by a day or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see them starting to do any weird
things at the tips, it'll be right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: tips of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very tops of the buds will start to
look like they're getting new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you see that, it is time to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are starting to go into a vegetative
state and revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plants will not show you a revege
growth until about day 17, maybe day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my 10 to 14 day recommendation
of increasing the hours of light will put
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a safe time frame if you harvest in
that 10 to 14 day window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is environment specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the plants you are growing and
you're familiar with them, feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with that 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are new plants and you're not sure
what to expect, maybe only go for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I truly do not think you will have a
problem with any sort of revege before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest if you start this 10 to 14 days
before you plan to cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step number one is to increase the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can increase the lights from 12.12
or 11.13, if you can put them back on an
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.6 or perhaps a 19 and five light cycle,
the more light, the merrier at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go 24 hours of light at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find that to be necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do want to run a 24 hour schedule
after you harvest, that is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not do it yet until we chop down
the usable part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got our plants on an 18.6,
perhaps a 19.5 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice that the plants that are
closest to the light that are getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: most light will begin to revege the
earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got one specific plant which
you want to revege, maybe get that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle, give it the prime real
estate where it is getting the best
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help speed up your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the next 10 to 14 days,
we are on that extended light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to continue to flush the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to pay attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to watch for that revege
growth, but things should go just as
[SPEAKER_00]: planned, just like they normally would if
we hadn't changed that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get to harvest one to three days
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to harvest just like
normal, except I would recommend to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the very bottom small buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four or five buds on that
plant that are the size of your thumb,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got big thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're the size of my thumb or your
thumb, that is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself somewhere between three and
five little buds on the bottom of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the rest of it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave those buds there so that you've just
got some sticks with four or five little
[SPEAKER_00]: buds on it, and that is going to be your
new plant that you are going to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has already been under an
extended light cycle, so it is already
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to adjust to that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows inside that we want it to begin
reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already is trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have removed all those giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just got a little bit of that plant
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier for that plant to revert
that little tiny batch of hormones to fix
[SPEAKER_00]: that little tiny part of that plant,
instead of trying to revert that entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant back to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've just got a couple little
buds, four or five little buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to start reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to slowly go back to the
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that at this point,
if you've got a room where you can do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put this plant under 24-7
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want 24 hours a day lighting for this
plant if you've got that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that space, put it under
an 18-6 or a 19-5 veg schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this plant will slowly begin to grow
new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to make kind of funky,
kind of twisted, kind of weird leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is expected from a plant that
is reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just took a plant and basically put it
through puberty and made that plant go
[SPEAKER_00]: from a pubescent teenager all the way to
an adult, all the way to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: it thought it should die, and now you were
returning it back to that prepubescent
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to make some weird-shaped
leaves for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like dill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make some really weird leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, those leaves will grow out and
make shoots that begin to look like normal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will look just like the leaves that
grew on that plant the first time you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of time it is going to take for
this plant to start reveging depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: several factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first factor is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this plant from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What part of the planet did this plant
originate from?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light does it expect to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light is it used to getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much light are you giving it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is probably the second determining
factor when it comes to a revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got good genetics and you've got
enough light, it may revege much more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly than different genetics under weak
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, before I mentioned turning that
light cycle to an 18-6 or a 19-5 while
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did that, you were going to be two
weeks ahead of the game as opposed to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you did not change your light cycle until
you harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both methods will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second method where we don't change
the light until after harvest is obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put us two weeks behind the
revege game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start growing
dill-looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start growing really
weird, curly, twisty leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is going to freak out for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the plant is freaking out,
there are a few things we can do to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it more comfortable and also speed up this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to consider is that this plant
has spent its entire life in the container
[SPEAKER_00]: which it is potted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be useful to repot this plant into
a larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this plant was in a three gallon,
maybe consider putting it in a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was in a five, maybe go for a seven,
maybe go for a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you chose the appropriate size pot for
that plant on its first run, it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly root bound inside that container
by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots should fill all of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are root bound want to go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, hey, my shoes are too
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be more challenging to revege a
plant which is root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good idea, something that may help
you out, would be to up pot that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: into a larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take that pot, it's real
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay the plant on its side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shimmy that pot right off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take that root ball and kind of break
it up with your fingers a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have that next container of soil
filled about halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set your plant right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just top fill the rest of the
soil on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give it a good water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will be happy with you for
giving it new shoes, bigger tires,
[SPEAKER_00]: a fresh home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful not to break any of the
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got a couple of small buds
left on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a fairly easy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one useful tip is to up pot your plant
into a larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it is not root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it knows, hey, this guy wants me
to grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expecting a little more for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hopefully it will grow and give it to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to get more from this plant is
to begin feeding it a solid, vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to veg newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start giving it vegetative newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget that just because you've
got a small plant, you still have a large
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water that container like you've got a
large root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take a few days for it to dry,
but it will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you've got more roots in
there than you've got plant up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that as you were watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go drowning the plant because I said
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then blame it on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind there's more below the
ground than what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that part up top is just a very small
representation of the root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you saw that root zone when you
repotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly how much you need to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got our plants on an extended
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either on 18-6, 19-5, or 24-0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to keep in mind is the
appropriate spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time we want to use a vegetative
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a metal halide light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're using a ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're using an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal to use the appropriate
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of a blue light and less of a red
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something geared, aimed more at vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get the plant to go back
into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give it the appropriate spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm going to hit pause and take a
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me lose my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could hear my voice messing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want that to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our extended light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have up-potted our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are on the way to trying to
reveg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give them strong veg newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give them some type of a kelp
product that will encourage them to reveg
[SPEAKER_00]: and speed up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants will continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will continue to come out of that
weird growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start, like I said before,
you'll start seeing weird leaves come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just weird looking, oddly shaped leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be twisty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be curly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not go the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that plant grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it will begin to produce normal
looking shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will just have little shoots grow right
out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those shoots will begin to produce normal
looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will kind of look like you just cut a
clone and put a clone right inside one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your buds and a clone grew out of your
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will begin to make perfect leaves
just like the original plant did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned before, I don't know
exactly when to expect this because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be strain dependent,
environment dependent, feed dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also it's going to depend on when you
started changing that light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it starts making good looking clones
come out of the top of the buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when it is time to clone that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that part that looks like a clone
coming out of your bud and simply clone
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snip it off of there and clone it just
like you would any other clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going into an easy cloner,
do it just like you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it, put a little snip in the middle,
dip it in the cloning gel, put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: easy cloner and let it rock for four to
seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put your clone in a
rapid rooter or a root riot or maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: rock wool cube, whatever you prefer,
take your clone, cut that nice 45 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: angle on there, scrape the clone up a
little bit to take off that outer surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: dip it right in your cloning solution,
put it in your rapid rooter, put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome, make sure your rooters are treated
and soaked properly and don't touch it for
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up and check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, whichever method you
choose, you will have a beautiful new
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I recommend is that you take that
clone and pot it and treat it as a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that plant grow up and start producing
branches and arms and shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use those branches and arms and
shoots as your new clones for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me kind of repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to clone the shoot that grows
out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to become your new mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that plant creates branches,
take clones off of that plant and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those branches and those shoots are ready
to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see any stress from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't even remember that they were
reveged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants that you cut should act just
like that original mom plant that you fell
[SPEAKER_00]: in love with that we forgot to take clones
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I have covered a quick
lesson on reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to recap really quickly just to
make sure I didn't leave anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts before harvest at the flush
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your lights back to 18.6 if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, that is understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will wait until after harvest and we
will deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave somewhere between
three and five little buds at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant just with a few leaves
sticking off of them so that we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for fresh growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fixed our lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've left a few small buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's change the light cycle back to
18.6 or 24.7, whichever works best for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then up pot that plant if you've got the
opportunity, the pot, the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the space, I really recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got to feed these plants a
vegetative mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over time you'll see that new growth
start coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut off any of that funky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones are moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's doing what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that weird shit grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stop happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually you'll see beautiful new
growth coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see that new growth that looks
normal, that looks like the old plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a few clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use those clones as future clone donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also call those mother plants,
but grow those plants up and take clones
[SPEAKER_00]: off of those and use those clones as your
next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you do have to revedge the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to clone that clone and
those clones will be reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those plants will be back to
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see any stress or any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, they will not even
remember that the plant they came from had
[SPEAKER_00]: ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick lesson on revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my quick recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys followed along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made it clear.

[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to stop these demons that keep
dancing in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down with disease, and I'm up before the
dawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand beds with children outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dancing on my lawn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dancing up alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning for the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I can't find a say.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I think it's time to leave it all
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find a way to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's nothing I can say to make it
stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down with disease, and the jungle's in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're climbing up my waterfalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swinging on my lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to hear the music, but I'm always
losing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm stepping on my rhythm and
they're stealing all my lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stealing all my lines and keep waiting for
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I can't find a say.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I think it's time to leave it all
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find a way to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's nothing I can say to make it
stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning for the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I can't find a say.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I think it's time to leave it all
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find a way to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's nothing I can say to make it
stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find a say.
This is all
