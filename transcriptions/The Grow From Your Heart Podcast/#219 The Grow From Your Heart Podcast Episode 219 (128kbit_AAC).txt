[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 219 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots crew for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that music up really loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the party, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a good ass mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why I'm in such a good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that when I get done recording
this podcast, I am going to go watch the
[SPEAKER_01]: live stream of the widespread panic
concerts from Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought about going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be a huge widespread panic
hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to love that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little, no offense to widespread
panic or their fans or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit burned out on panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go to every show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see every band, so I pick and
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, the ones I choose to see are
Phish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see Phish religiously until I die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to go see Dead in Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I like to catch comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turning into a grumpy old man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the young kids like to come talk at
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've complained about that on previous
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer to go check out comedy
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ranting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambling already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I get done with this, I get to go
check out the live stream of widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: panic at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all rainy anyway, so I think we might
have lucked out by not driving to Red
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocks and dealing with that bullshit in
the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to be here on the couch watching
it, taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have to sneak our shit in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we get to play a game in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some hood sections of this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some parts of this town can be a little
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some nefarious characters in
this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are playing a game right now of
gunshots or fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth of July is creeping up on us,
but also when it gets summertime,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gangsters get crazy, and I keep
hearing a bunch of loud booms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I'm curious as to the one I
just heard a couple seconds ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could have been a 12 gauge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also could have been a firework.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun is still up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite dark yet, so it's kind of
weird to have fireworks going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it was a firework, but until I
hear some sirens, I won't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're playing a game of
gunshots or fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Place your bets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe by the end of the episode,
we'll know something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're being on the door to ask me
questions, I won't hear shit because I got
[SPEAKER_01]: these headphones on and I got the noise
canceling stuff on the software.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't getting a goddamn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I got some... And
let me start by saying, they do not pay me
[SPEAKER_01]: to say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just happy with my purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up some Durban poison batter from
our friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been digging the Apothecary extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am high as shit and I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, also, I took a dab of the Durban
poison and I love Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got me super blazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really like a head high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes my... When I used to smoke a lot
of weed, my eyes would get droopy and dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs make my eyes get bug-eyed and all
like, I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives me a nice eye high and I enjoy
it, but it doesn't get me... I can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't reach what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also picked up something on somebody
else's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Mambo batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's marked as a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, I'm not a fan of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like flowers that taste like Kush and
Diesel, but I don't like hash that tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: like Kush and Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smelling it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a real earthy, cushy,
diesel sort of a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like Stardog or maybe Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very likely a Gorilla Glue
blend of glue and something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another flavor in there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first dabbed it, I was like,
oh, I'm not fond of the flavor of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got super high and the high it gave
me was like this weird, clear head high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I wanted to give a sermon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ask me a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk about anything for five hours
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a dab of that also and I'm learning
that that flavor is growing on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my brain knows, hey, when you
taste that, you get that cool feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my brain might be knowing that I want
to smoke more of that type of turp,
[SPEAKER_01]: more of that type of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to blame a lot of this
Rambles on, first of all, shout out to Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to break myself of this caffeine Dr.
Pepper habit, but the Rambles are from
[SPEAKER_01]: some Durban Poison Batter and some Mambo
Batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer Shatter I think is my favorite
for just all the time smoking,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the High Kinabinoid Full Spectrum
Extract is a good treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going out for something
fancy, that's the one to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm trying to medicate for my head,
because I do have a traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_01]: injury, if I'm trying to calm down the
stuff that comes from that, Distillate is
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to take a big fat dab that makes
my lungs go, and my eyes go red for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute and water come out of the corner of
my eyes, this batter really does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put, it's hard to scoop up a lot,
but if you get the right dab tool,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can scoop up a nice chunky dab of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the nail cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too cool, but I let it go a little
cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I do some Shatter and just drop a lot
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cap it, and I get such a nice dab out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a real fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't vape, because I'm a grown man,
but I feel like that's probably what
[SPEAKER_01]: vaping feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels smooth in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no cough to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something I would buy every day
and dab every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same price as Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we know that I grow my own
flowers, so I am able to have my stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: processed into Shatter by a friend,
so I don't go buy Shatter or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I want something fancy,
like a treat for myself, I'll go hit
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go hit a couple other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll run to Three Rivers and grab some
stuff to spoil myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The batter has been what I've been going
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some of the Lemon Jeffery high
cannabinoid full spectrum extracts sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Lemon Jeff high terpene full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pouring those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend Sean over at Apothecary
recommended that I do two grams of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals, the high cannabinoid full
spectrum extract, and one gram of the
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid high terpene full spectrum extract
together and mix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that's his favorite ratio,
so I will try that later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to have two full grams,
and I know I've got more than one gram of
[SPEAKER_01]: the liquid, so I'll make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy fuck, I'm rambling, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me for a podcast number
219.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did we get this far?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to slow down, and I need to ... I
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start the show with big
rambles, and then we're going to go with
[SPEAKER_01]: some sad news, but then we're going to get
to a listener email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to somebody and
give them a moment of thanks to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make it sound like I was
this guy's best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew him on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him a couple of times at events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to turn down the gain on this mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear my face clicking and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn this down just a touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some gain off that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some reverb on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should sound much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it sounds way better in the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if I was kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let me give back to where I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been an activist in the cannabis
community for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a strong supporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been a loud voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think he's an asshole,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: People that make waves and do things are
often thought of as assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who speak up for themselves and
others are often thought of as assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that don't follow the normal
everyday life and say what's on their mind
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of being a coward are often
thought of as assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people who are considered
assholes, they take pride in being thought
[SPEAKER_01]: of as an asshole because they stand up for
themselves and they're doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me recently, yeah,
I must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people fucking hate me lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just laughed at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, you're killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people hate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude was one of cannabis's most
hated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's name was Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep saying was because,
excuse me, I'm choking up from these dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey passed away a couple of days ago
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recording on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just passed away a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to Mickey
Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey Martin was a true fucking activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a loud mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a pushy motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the cannabis scene needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us are stoned and lazy and laid
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey would smoke some dope and want to
go preach the cannabis gospel to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that don't believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every picture I've seen of Mickey,
he's got a bullhorn in one hand and a can
[SPEAKER_01]: of Coke in the other or a can of Coke and
a cigarette, or he's flipping off the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a badass dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He learned it from his badass pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis community, the cannabis army
lost a leader, not just a soldier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost a fucking leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give a shout out a very brief
moment of silence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't go too long, but I want to give a
half a second of silence to Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke a fat joint with you wherever we end
up together because we're going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey ruffled a lot of feathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey did a thing called the Fuck Mickey
Awards where he would pick people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry and troll the fuck out
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The awards were offensive like most
useless cannabis celebrity or most useless
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would just list people who,
I don't even want to say the names because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was embarrassing of who he voted for
winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were my friends occasionally,
but people were, he just trolled the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of people that he did not find worthy
of their cannabis notoriety.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had beef with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say the last I heard
he had beef with a specific person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk out of my own land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain, so I don't want to be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, shout out to Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be the same going to events with
Adam there with the bullhorn yelling at
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been asking about my breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I talked about it a little bit in
the last episode, that breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I spoke about pollinating the
plants on Father's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Father's Day has passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been almost a week since Father's
Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two close ones of the same male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two of them in there,
one on one side of the room, one on the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing my best not to let the
pollen get to the female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the 18th, which was Sunday,
which was Father's Day, I moved as the
[SPEAKER_01]: 19th, I guess, one of those two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved the male plants, one in the middle
of all the other plants and then one on
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I did it, I suited up real
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wore clothes that I could just take off
right away and throw into the washer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I did it, I had to go wash
my dreadlocks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am seriously six feet, five inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got dreadlocks that go,
one of them touches my knee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say my dreadlocks go to my
knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: One dreadlock touches my knee.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to like mid thigh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go past my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I let them down in the car,
they hang in the back seat of the car,
[SPEAKER_01]: like on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got crazy dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I did the pollination, I had to go
wash my dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go hose down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to clean everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I digress.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 18th, I went in there and I
pollinated that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Arise male pollinated about 20
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over the list last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what I can remember right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a redheaded stranger,
which is Willy's wonder to an unknown
[SPEAKER_01]: haze, which I would assume would be silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain that's the genetics of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a strain in there called
prodagium, which is I think is how I was
[SPEAKER_01]: told it's pronounced from ethos genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I bred it to that is because
that strain smells like straight up
[SPEAKER_01]: oranges and grease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the fucking smell, but it
doesn't yield for shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that Arise male will really
increase the yield of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in there is a grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Hell's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Jeff's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is Capelton.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Kalonji Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm not sure what else is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a small platinum tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of small things that are
being pollinated for the first time just
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grow those seeds myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I like them, I'll make more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow, there's a bunch of new stuff
coming up that I just made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that breeding project is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the seeds developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been just about a week and I can see
the little seed pods happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted a couple of pictures to my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to check out the Instagram,
it's Iri underscore genetics, I-R-I-E
[SPEAKER_01]: underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these plants, these seeds are going to
need like six weeks-ish to mature and
[SPEAKER_01]: harden up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plants need to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes Miss Jenny Beth comes and
helps me pull seeds out of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for doing that, JB.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's going to be a minute before
anybody gets any of those because I am
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to keep most of the Kalonji
and the Capelton are brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Redheaded Stranger and the Pradagium
are brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those are brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to hoard them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to harvest them myself and grow
most of them myself because that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: what I like to do with the first batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll let you know how they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you know when they start
hardening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I grow them, I will
certainly keep you posted on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which allows me to move forward a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, I talked about the
breeding project where I used a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed that to Flow and White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have talked about germinating those
recently also.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have sprouted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in solo cups with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to run the entire run in solo
cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds strange, but I put a
certain amount of solo cups in this
[SPEAKER_01]: Tupperware dish that I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fit perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I do is I poke holes in the
bottom of the solo cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty of holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I water the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water wicks up into the soil and
the plants stay fed and nutrient-ed and
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the seeds into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to sprout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're maybe like a half inch tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like one knuckle tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just the little itty bitty baby
sprouts right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are just starting to come
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that I have thought of,
I thought that I should share with you
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a good idea that I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a new grower, I would germinate
my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would put them into dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seed would go fucking flying
around in the cup somewhere with that
[SPEAKER_01]: water and end up in a random spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'd get a cup of soil or a pot
of dirt with a plant growing way off to
[SPEAKER_01]: one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you watered it, it just got
washed away with the rainfall or with the
[SPEAKER_01]: flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's just randomly in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've started doing, I have my
germinated seed that's just got maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: half inch little tail sticking off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill my whatever it's going into.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a pot, I prefer a small cup
because some of these are going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are going to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to water a whole bunch of
soil to keep a small plant alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put a seedling into a beer cup or a
six inch net pot, sometimes a five inch
[SPEAKER_01]: net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use just very well aerated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need too much amendments because I
feed them well on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make just an indention about one
knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the second time I said knuckle
deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try not to say that again on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make an indention about that far with my
finger into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I set the seedling in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just press a little bit of dirt
over it, just kind of backfill it real
[SPEAKER_01]: gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I use my spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a spray bottle, a pump sprayer that
is used for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a pump sprayer that is used for
non pesticide products like foliar feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I want to feed with push,
or if I want to do something that just is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one with an X on it, which is for
bug sprays and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got one that does it is not
marked, which is for cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like to rinse my plants with just
clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, sometimes if I spray them with
pesticide, sometimes specific pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will rinse it off later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, I will take the clean sprayer and
I'll just put clean water in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I'll put a little light nutrient
solution in there and I'll pH it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of watering the cups that have
as fresh seedling in there, I'll water it
[SPEAKER_01]: first before I put the ceiling in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say that part, water it,
make my indention, put the ceiling in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, backfill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'll probably dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably take 24, maybe 48 hours for
that soil to dry before you'll need to
[SPEAKER_01]: water it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I take the pump sprayer and I
don't want to blast it, but I want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from above just like rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think about it,
the water that you're going to get on your
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings in nature would fall from above.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the pump sprayer to spray it from
above, making it like it's raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make it rain onto my little seedlings,
and what I've seen that do, the seedlings
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to poke out of the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're bent over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're over like a 180 degree turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of them will be growing straight up,
but that first little set of sprouts is
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck on the soil and it can't pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed when the raindrops
essentially land on it, it pushes that
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt off of that first set of sprout
leaves and they pop up like little
[SPEAKER_01]: springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got some seedlings that won't
pop up, instead of, I've used my finger to
[SPEAKER_01]: get in there and pull them up and I've
completely killed them and fucked them up
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just spraying them with a little bit of
water lightly will move that soil down and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's moist enough to where it makes the
water, it makes the soil push right off of
[SPEAKER_01]: that leaf and that fucker just pops right
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really cool technique and it also
won't disrupt the soil so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spray lightly, you can spray
closer, you can spray from further away,
[SPEAKER_01]: just adjust your spray the way you need to
and you won't ruin the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the soil plenty wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also if you're OCD and you're weird,
you can spray downward and it pushes all
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil off the ridge of the cup back
into the pot or off the edge of the cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the cup, into the surface of the
soil and it makes it look nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have loose soil stuck to your
cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a side bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have an email that I promised you I
would read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if they want me to say their
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say their name in the email,
but I'm not going to read it because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not sure if they want to or if they wanted
me to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want me to read your email on a
show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm filtering through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said in a previous episode,
I bought myself a printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wireless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woohoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can print my emails just straight
from my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm sitting somewhere, just imagine
where I might be sitting somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: checking my emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't fill you in on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm sitting there, my legs are
going numb and I'm checking my emails,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just shoot the email right to my
printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I come to do a podcast,
I scoop up all those emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read through a few of them and like
that's the one I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do kind of in order to maybe
something that I was doing at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your email matched up with something
that was on my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how they usually get read or
order of importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me one that's like,
Hey, you got to read this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually very time pertinent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would go first, but I'm fucking
rambling today from all these dabs and
[SPEAKER_01]: caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, let's get into this email,
which is something that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about something I do on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been trying to teach the crew a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also been learning more about
through experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey, I'm going to say my name is,
but I'm going to skip the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I found your podcast about a week
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to say it's now one of my top
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to, I'm still getting caught
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from a non-legal state, sadly,
not many people to get knowledge from
[SPEAKER_01]: around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a question I was wanting to run
by you, if you have the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since I'm just making sure the computer
doesn't freeze, it froze a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to look at the email and look
at the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I have to grow stealthily,
space is limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was curious on your thoughts on using
a trellis and doing the canopy of green
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe was called, I've read that it
can help yield more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the canopy of green technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe what was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read that it can help yield more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes on to say, I was thinking
of trying it on my next harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently working on my very first
harvest and I'm in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted your opinion on using a
trellis or any tips you'd like to give a
[SPEAKER_01]: newbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning a lot from your show as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the awesome podcast,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps me get through my 10 hour shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for the email, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, 10 hour shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you are listening to the throwback
Thursday episodes that I put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys haven't caught on on
Thursdays, I call it throwback Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out chunks of old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually three episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a three hour show just in one
download.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the old episodes had a lot of
long written out content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt now when I listened to it,
it feels really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels more like a school lesson,
but a lot of you guys love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me know if you're listening to
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're catching those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I can help you out in your
non-legal state, but be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get into your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying, and this is a very good
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer, yes, do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, of course, it's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to give a long drawn out answer
just because that's how I do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're asking about, I know it as a
screen of green or a trellising technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say you've got limited space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be very helpful for you in
limited space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got nearly unlimited space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a technique that I utilize in
a commercial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called the sea of green or the
screen of green technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sea of green, in my opinion,
is more when you do a bunch of small
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are just one cola and it's
just a sea of colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The screen of green, in my opinion,
is when you use trellising or chicken wire
[SPEAKER_01]: or something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of my descriptions will be using
trellising that you buy from the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: store or wherever you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just trellising designed for
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either six inch squares or three inch
squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three and a half inch squares,
you can buy it in lots of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to buy the either five or six foot
wide by like 30, 60 or 120 feet long
[SPEAKER_01]: because we do long sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the stuff I'll be talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use plastic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use harder stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to use the rigid stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I fuck up more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the screen can be a little hard the
first time getting it unraveled,
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out how to get it set up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a bitch the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you figure it out, it's really,
really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's actually talk a little bit
about the screen of green method and how
[SPEAKER_01]: and why it's used and how it will help
increase your yields and why I use it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the screen of green method,
one thing it can really do is help you
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce your plant numbers because instead
of using a bunch of plants to fill some
[SPEAKER_01]: space, you can use less plants depending
on the amount of space you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: the size pots you're using and how much
time you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use less plants to fill the same
amount of square footage because instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant growing straight up,
you'll be bending the plant and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that straight up growth is gonna go left,
right, north, south, east, west.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll spread it out in every direction
and you'll fill the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the main goal of the first
trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I use a trellising system,
I usually set up at least two trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: nets, sometimes three, just depending on
what strain I'm running and how big the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants have gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're setting up a trellis,
here are a couple of things to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need somewhere to anchor
the trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to pull this thing fairly tight,
especially the first layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first layer is gonna be holding the
plant down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's gonna wanna pop up from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be anchored very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times in my case, I'm working
with like a botanic care tray or a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just say you've got a four by
four or a five by five table, a four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four botanic care table, a four by four
botanic care tray with like nine three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots in there and your plants are
about 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got the table up off the ground
a little bit that you wanna build.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would build a frame out of PVC piping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make the base five feet by five
feet, just a square.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would make another five by five
square and I would attach those together
[SPEAKER_01]: with six foot poles in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a five by five by six.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rectangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what you're gonna use that
for is for attaching the trellis in
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got your four by four table,
you got a five by five square around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pull around near each corner,
like about a foot out from each corner,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up, then six feet above,
maybe five and a half feet, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow, depending on how much space you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it as tall as you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do ours at the commercial grow at five
and a half and six feet because the fans
[SPEAKER_01]: are at six feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my go-to, but maybe you only
need four feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you only need three feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what style you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your plants on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this square around the table
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take the first set of net and
attach each corner so that you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice square square.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no bumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no lumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a perfect grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line that starts on the pole on the
right is the same line of string that ends
[SPEAKER_01]: on the pole on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you've got those squares
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds crazy, but you want to
pull it tight and if you don't have it
[SPEAKER_01]: straight, it won't pull tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be crooked when your squares are
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's missing the whole point of this
whole technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get it tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be pulling your plant down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This net, the whole purpose of the first
trellis is to stop the plants from growing
[SPEAKER_01]: up and to make them grow sideways,
like left and right, like horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll take this first net and like I
said earlier, the plants are approximately
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this net right at the 18 inch mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know if you've topped your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you haven't topped the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have a whole bunch of tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have just one glory bud going on
so far, but this net now is going to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants from growing any taller for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them at this 18 inch mark for
until you fill out the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are gonna grow and they're
gonna go into the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got to grab the plant and bend
it over and stick it back under the net
[SPEAKER_01]: and make it grow sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to keep doing this until you
fill in that canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's gonna grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're bending it to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it makes those little tiny shoots
off the side of that branch, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just bent it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are gonna grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a few days, you're gonna need to grab
those little branches and tuck those
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got wires running left and
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your whole goal eventually is to have one
branch, one little bud site coming up out
[SPEAKER_01]: of each section of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every three and a half or six inch
section will have one growth arm coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the first couple of weeks,
you're gonna put that trellis on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how long you're gonna let the
trellis go before you flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the trellis on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will grow into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start bending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's gonna get bent over and then
it'll start growing back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to grab it and put it under
another part of the trellis and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start growing back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant wants to grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got hormones in it that tell it to go
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's got a top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to compete for a top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to have one dominant cola,
but we keep putting it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the branches are gonna try to
grow up and they all have an option to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a dominant cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all gonna fight for that
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time you pull one down,
it's gonna try to go back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll figure it out after a couple of
pulling downs, how much the plant can take
[SPEAKER_01]: before you break part of it, how you're
supposed to pull it down and bend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put, when the plant starts growing
into the screen, just gently pull it down
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit and put it under part of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go over and under, over and under,
and just keep weaving that fucker through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as more parts grow and more parts
grow, you fill in every part of the screen
[SPEAKER_01]: until every square on that screen,
or at least as much of that screen as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can, is filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then flower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're gonna wanna put another
trellis on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere between, and it depends on how
much time you wanna wait, how big you
[SPEAKER_01]: intend on getting these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several factors to think about
right now, but somewhere between eight and
[SPEAKER_01]: 16, maybe eight and 18 more inches,
put another screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this screen is going to support your
colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't wanna get in there with a bunch
of sticks and shove a bunch of sticks into
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to use that many sticks
and to grow this size and in a screen
[SPEAKER_01]: method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put another trellis up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one's gonna hold your donkey dick
buds that start flopping over,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're gonna have a whole sea of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just gonna be rows and rows,
left and right, on a little grid of just
[SPEAKER_01]: big giant buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need another screen on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one is to hold them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is to spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't wanna go extreme and use
the screen to fill it out, you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: that just to pull them down a little bit,
and it'll just spread out the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make more of the inner branches
grow, because you'll get more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna talk a little bit more
about getting more light to the parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the screen also in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get them growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spread them out, get them growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll start seeing them popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have that canopy filled up,
let them start popping up out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that second trellis on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get them worked in there how you
want them, you've got to, what my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: would say, give it a fucking chance to win
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pull all these arms down and
bend them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using my own arm and hand as a visual
aid here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pull it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arm's gonna grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pull it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna try to go back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting my hand up in an upward
motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make that one struggle too hard at
the very tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the tips kind of grow up until they
get long enough to get to another screen
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put it down and make sure it's
got a chance to grow up again and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't flower it if you've got some of
them like struggle-budded tucked into
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them kind of get stable before you do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get it growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill in that canopy as much as you feel
like you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it grow into that second canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which could be anywhere from like six,
eight, 10, maybe 18 inches up above,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how long, what size pot,
hydro, soil, coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But get that next trellis up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is to hold all those buds from
falling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing something like blueberry
headband or jack flash, you may need a
[SPEAKER_01]: third trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing super lemon haze,
you may need a third trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I told you to make those poles
six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my grow, the poles are six feet tall
and right now the blueberry headband has
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking grown way past those poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in flower and they're only,
they're about five weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still got three or four weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be fucking savages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But put that third trellis on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's simply to support the gigantic buds
that'll be growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them to stay tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they start flowering, you don't want
to bend them over too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you can do at the beginning of
the flowering phase or late into the veg
[SPEAKER_01]: phase, if one little section is getting
taller, one branch is trying to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bastard and grow taller than everything
else, give it a twist between your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it a twist and let it turn and
squeeze it until it kind of cracks and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just bend it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I'm never going to say just
bend it over again like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just break it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't break it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bend it over is what you really need
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bend it over so that it's not as tall and
then it'll slowly grow back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just going to kind of slow it
from growing up and make it grow
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll get a little knuckle right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get a little tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk more about
knuckles and popping in just a second
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your first trellis on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have your plants grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will take that first
trellis and they'll lay it on top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and push kind of hard to make it go
down, which I am not opposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the time, you'd put the
trellis up and let the plant grow into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the time, force them
down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull those arms down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've already got the plant grown,
you can pull the arms and branches down
[SPEAKER_01]: and spread them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those fuckers nice and spread
out and horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizontal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can get them way more horizontal
than you can vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be amazed at how much
horizontal space you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got low ceilings,
this is definitely helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great way to use low ceilings
and use more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the first one stretching
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the second one supporting them and
you got the third one there for those
[SPEAKER_01]: giant, giant buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to have one top per square to
maximize the space vertically and
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say that this person who wrote
this email, his grow room is six feet by
[SPEAKER_01]: six feet square.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got 1,000 watt light hanging from the
center of the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air is handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air conditioning is well, the
ventilation is well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got air exchange happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperatures are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not our concern right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got this four by four table that's
raised up a little bit so it's work level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he's got this five by five trellis on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to fill that grow space and
that light area with as much bud as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can produce to make it cost effective and
worth your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were in a place where it's not
legal to grow, you need to make it worth
[SPEAKER_01]: your ass because you could end up in
prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need every fucking gram you can get
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're going to do it,
fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay for electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to pay for a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you don't have to do any lawyer
shit, but there may be costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to make everything you can if
you're in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about spreading it out and
getting as much light as you can into this
[SPEAKER_01]: square area and getting as much bud as you
can in that square area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're spreading out the plants
and putting one bud per square,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were putting as much bud from top to
bottom in that space as you can and also
[SPEAKER_01]: from left to right in that space as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now keep in mind that the light will only
penetrate depending on what kind of light
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a Gavita, maybe you'll get
three feet of penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are fucking savage beasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got just a normal single ended
HPS bulb, you're only going to get about
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 inches of good light penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get it to where you've got
18 inches of buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want 18 inch tall colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want more than that, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to grow taller,
let them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want at least 18 inch tall colas
in every single square of that trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to look nice and
uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to make that work is only do one
strain in that room or do one strain per
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're going to trellis,
do one strain per section or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know from experience,
it is a pain in the ass trying to trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: a tray with multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have Jack Flash and what else would
you have next to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum Tangi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Jack Flash grows big and tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum Tangi just grows like short and
stout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to trellis them next to each
other because then your trellis is like 18
[SPEAKER_01]: inches off the canopy in one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to make it go 24 off the next
bar just to make it fit that one fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stick with one strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've got things trellised and it
looks good, things I would recommend in
[SPEAKER_01]: there to increase your yield and also just
increase the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a pain in the ass trying
to trellis them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just turn different directions,
kind of like I'm going to do an Indian
[SPEAKER_01]: burn, but I don't let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the plant, I'm going to do with
my knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will do that and that was my
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you know you did it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That spot where you did that, in a few
days it'll make to where it looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: damn knuckle and it'll start to swell up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe and I think it's proven that
those little sections make the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger and they allow for more vascular
action through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can move more nutrient to where they
need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes the plant stronger and it
makes the plants bulkier.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see them all knurled up like
that, that's how you know people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: spending time loving those plants,
making them branchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take off all the bottom little ugly funky
buds that aren't going to make something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need that shit on the bottom
where the light's not getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need those skinny branches that
are just going to have fucking dandelion
[SPEAKER_01]: buds instead of real buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that energy, let that water nutrients,
let that move up to the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then pop them so that they get knurled and
they get stronger and they look thicker
[SPEAKER_01]: and healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that all the way up into like
week two and three of flower if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable doing it and you'll see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do it to some plants and don't do it
to others and see what I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_01]: see if it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it doesn't, message me,
call me out and I'll read it on the show
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll tell everybody I fucked up and
was wrong, but I've got faith in the tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've been rambling for a long goddamn
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never stopped and took a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been going for 37 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to me ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got more though.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing a screen of green
technique, you are going to fill in a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a bunch of screens in
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to keep in mind how
you're going to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get to every pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get water to every pot easily?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to have to crawl under
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to have a watering system
built in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that in mind before you get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you move the tables?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you move whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't screw yourself and not be able
to get in there to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's just a little extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing the trellising,
I would say use some zip ties,
[SPEAKER_01]: put up one corner, measure out how many
squares wide you feel like your tray is
[SPEAKER_01]: and then try to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this may sound crazy, but when you
start doing it, you'll understand what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hypothetically say that the tray,
that the net is like 30 squares wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might be accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like 30 squares wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for the five foot table that I
like to trellis, I have to count in two
[SPEAKER_01]: squares for that thing to fit perfectly on
the PVC pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I zip tied those two squares to the
PVC on the, on my end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just lay, I've dragged the net
across the plants, across the table to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I zip tie the appropriate squares
at that end, leaving two squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: I count two squares in, I zip tie that
into the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I cut off the excess,
but the two squares that are hanging off
[SPEAKER_01]: the right and left of each end,
it looks like a tablecloth with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: excess, you guys, if that makes it easier
to visualize.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do this, it will make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this, you'll go, oh,
that's what he fucking meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trellis will be wider than your table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you hang the trellis up,
it'll be extra on the left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use zip ties to create like a little
cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring those two down and zip tie them to
the side of the bars also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got vertical trellis,
keeping the plants up on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've also got a little trellis on
the sides, just two sections, maybe three
[SPEAKER_01]: sections of squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if there are shorter branches that
are falling on the edge of the table,
[SPEAKER_01]: those will be right there to catch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe some of the little guys that want
to wander off in the commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't have that there, some of
those will end up just falling to the side
[SPEAKER_01]: and smacking you in the damn face every
time you walk by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to leave a little extra trellis
on the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're a spendy and you want to be
bougie and go spend some extra money,
[SPEAKER_01]: go get more trellis and put trellis up
just like a fence along the sides and just
[SPEAKER_01]: build a fence around the whole canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you can get support all the
way around that whole damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just if you want to spend extra
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're one of those guys that just
loves to be in the grow all day and
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have shit else to do, go do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make it look really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I have taught you guys a little bit
about screen of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sir, my friend G, I'm just going to call
you G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your name starts with a G.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you want me to say your
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: G, the guy that sent me this email.
