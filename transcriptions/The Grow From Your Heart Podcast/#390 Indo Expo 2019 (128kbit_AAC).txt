[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 390 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds,
North America's largest online seed
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm taking dabs of chem brulee full
spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is copper chem and lemon brulee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma and flavor are described as
rotten lemon rind and sour fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is funky, it is gross, and it is also
delicious all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the texture, the aroma,
the flavor, and I really enjoy the high
[SPEAKER_00]: from the chem brulee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice that my voice is a little
bit funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I was at the endo expo
peddling irie genetic seeds all weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talk to a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we talk about the endo expo,
I want to share with you what I did this
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This afternoon, I pollinated a female
blueberry cookies plant and a female
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry fields plant with pollen from a
male buckeye banana plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people may be curious,
what is that buckeye banana?
[SPEAKER_00]: The buckeye banana is the Ohio buckeye
from Melvinetics cross to the banana OG
[SPEAKER_00]: from Texas Kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some pollen from that plant and I
applied that to the blueberry cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those will make some very
interesting crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't plan to release those seeds,
at least not the F1s, maybe further
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: My initial goal here with this original
pollination is to create a few seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to find a male from the
blueberry cookies buckeye banana cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to find a male that stays kind
of short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of squat, kind of branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want tight inner node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to have big fat indica dominant
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to find a male that doesn't
take a really long time to start producing
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want sort of a shorter flowering plant
at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also hoping that that plant carries
the aroma from the blueberry cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then I want the colors from the
buckeye purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want the trichome content from the
banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what I'm looking for in this
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to find it in the amount of
seeds that I create.
[SPEAKER_00]: I anticipate I've created about 30 to 50
seeds in my experience with the size plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that I pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have as much pollen as I wish I
would have had, but I feel like I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good job pollinating those little
tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in several weeks those seeds will be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dry the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll crack up the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pick a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll germinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I find a super stud of a male in
that first batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I find a couple of sexy females
in that first batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on what I see from that first batch
of seeds, I will make my decisions on
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants I choose to pollinate with
that new male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also decide if I choose to make
F2s or further generations of this seed
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really make any commitments or get
too big of an idea at this point in time
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know what I am creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to believe in myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to feel like I have a good
intuition, but these plants may not breed
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have made just a bunch of crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see what I have created before I
get too excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to put the cart in front of
my horse and start thinking about where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sprinkle the pollen from a
plant that hasn't been selected yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't make any decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make any future plans with this
project until the pollination creates
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, the seeds are grown, then I take a
lot of notes, and then I know what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I'd like to
mention before we get to the main topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show, which of course is going to be
the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to announce that iRegenetics
is now a proud member of the Oregon Elite
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds,
North America's largest online seed
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer, now carries iRegenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at
OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's jump into the main topic
of this show, which is the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Indo Expo is the world's largest
indoor cannabis and hemp expo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it landed in Denver on January 26th
and 27th, and I was lucky enough to be
[SPEAKER_00]: invited to be a vendor with Oregon Elite
Seeds this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past couple of years, I have attended
the Indo Expo as a visitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to walk around and check out the
expo, see all of the booths, see all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vending, see what was going on in the
entire place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked a hundred miles each weekend,
but this year I got to share a booth with
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds, our friends from
Oregon Elite Seeds, hosted a booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we brought several breeders to the
booth with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Always Be Flowering hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had MedTree Seeds hanging out with us,
and over the weekend we had Doc's Dank
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Shoreline Seeds pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a whole group of breeders at the
booth all weekend long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my first time vending at a booth,
and I honestly thought that it was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be really stressful, but parking was
the hardest part, and once you got parked,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you had to do was carry your shit in,
and it all happened on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Indo Expo moves all around the country
and does shows every few months,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was their 10th show, so they've
gotten really good at organizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows where to go, everybody
knows where to be, so it's not super
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing like some of the cannabis events
tend to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So loading in was super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started meeting people and making
friends at 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get loaded into the building
before people started coming up and asking
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and introducing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't waste any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got right to business and right in
action, started shaking hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of wonderful people this
weekend at the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of old friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some folks I only get to see at
Indo Expos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some folks I only get to see at
industry events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss a lot of those folks, and it is a
great time seeing all of your smiling
[SPEAKER_00]: faces, so I really enjoyed that part of
the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being stuck at a booth, I didn't get to
travel around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday, I left my booth one time to go
hit the men's room, and it honestly took
[SPEAKER_00]: me way too long to get away from my booth
to the men's room and back because being a
[SPEAKER_00]: member of the Colorado cannabis community
at a cannabis event, I was quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to say I'm popular,
but I know a lot of people at that venue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it took me a really long time to get
from my booth to the men's room and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to be away from my booth for
that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I had abandoned ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: My logo, my iRegenetics flag is hanging up
on the wall, and I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Saturday, I was away for maybe 20
minutes to go use the restroom and get
[SPEAKER_00]: right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Sunday, I didn't even leave my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no reason to take off from the
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have an opportunity to eat or
drink anything because the booth was so
[SPEAKER_00]: busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, there was no need to use the
restroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting at is I was at my
booth the entire time the entire weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the good part about that is everybody
knew where to find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted up to social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I am at booth 414.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people stopped by and said
hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see so many friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see, of course, I got to see all
of my expo friends, all my friends that I
[SPEAKER_00]: only see at industry events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see people that I have not seen
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet new people that I have never
met before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet people I've been interacting
with on social media, either Facebook or
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or whatever it is, for years,
and I've never met them in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do some handshakes, some high
fives, some hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to see what people's smiles actually
look like because you could post whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of folks who listen to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of the breeders next to me were
like, man, a lot of people are just
[SPEAKER_00]: walking up and saying thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, ah, bro, I've got a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach people how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, man, that is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people stood in line to come
shake my hand and say thank you for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant as much as all of the seed
business meant to me all weekend long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stopped and said hello,
if you shook my hand and said thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the podcast, if you stopped by and
said hi at all, that means the world to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I also met a lot of other great
breeders there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great breeders stopped and said
hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders I've been, like I said,
talking to, interacting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got to meet all of those
breeders that I've been talking to online
[SPEAKER_00]: and wondered what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I really enjoyed and something
that my friends at my booth were making
[SPEAKER_00]: fun of me for is every Dreadlock person at
the Endo Expo stopped at my booth and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: They either came straight to my booth or
they'd be walking by and they would see
[SPEAKER_00]: either me with dreads or they'd see my I
read genetics flag, which is the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: flag been turned red, yellow and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would see either me or that flag and
something in them would just bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: right to my booth and they would want to
come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really love that all the deadheads,
all the Rastas, all the Dreadlocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the freaks, all the weirdos,
they all wanted to come say what's up to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really means a lot that I've kind
of got my own little niche community there
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out, big fist bump to all the
dreads, all the Rastas, all the deadheads,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the freaks and weirdos, all the freaky
people that came to see me this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also talking about support, I want to give
a huge shout out to a few of my fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have known the boys from the Dude Gros
show for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met Scotty and the dude a few times,
but I don't remember ever meeting Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally got to meet Guru from the
Dude Gros podcast at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Guru?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking some great pictures of
the dude and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we have more conversations in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it was good to see the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude has moved to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really great to see the dude
back here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met the dude at a Dude Gros cup a few
years ago in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, he will always be a part of
the Colorado cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great to see my buddy back in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to take a few pictures and
get a few selfies and get a high five from
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my podcasting buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Scotty Real, I didn't see you at the
Endo Expo, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to catch up with you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys aren't listening to the
Dude Gros podcast, make sure you go give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like my show, you should definitely
like the Dude Gros podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to
Shango Los from the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several episodes back, I gave Shango Los
and his podcast a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango was gracious enough to find me at
the Endo Expo and approach my booth and
[SPEAKER_00]: shake my hand and personally thank me for
shouting out his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was really respectful that
he walked up and shook my hand and thanked
[SPEAKER_00]: me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not listening to the Shaping
Fire podcast yet, I recommend that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think you can learn a lot and I
think you will really enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, big shout out to the boys
from the Dude Gros show and also a big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Shango Los from the Shaping
Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm trying not to get too specific
with shout outs, because I don't want to
get too specific with shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I met and interacted with so many
people this weekend that I know I will end
[SPEAKER_00]: up leaving somebody out if I try to list
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to get to a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm talking about fellow podcasters,
let's talk about our friends from P&L Gros
[SPEAKER_00]: Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends P and Lee have been supporting
the podcast for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been supporting P&L Gros Systems
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their business is based out of London,
UK, and they made it all the way to Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: To come be a part of the Denver cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great honor to finally shake
hands with my friends, Peter and Lee from
[SPEAKER_00]: P &L Gros Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an honor to work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of great promotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with their equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've given me some equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in a future episode, I've got a
minder unit to give away to a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for details on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was great to finally meet my
friends that we have supported each other
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually told me that they would
not have been able to make it this far in
[SPEAKER_00]: their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly would not have made it to
the Endo Expo if it were not for the
[SPEAKER_00]: support of myself and the Grow From Your
Heart podcast, which means the support
[SPEAKER_00]: from you folks that listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great to finally shake hands and
get a hug and take a picture with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends P and Lee from P&L Gros Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you make it back over here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to spend more time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that is a great way to segue
into my next part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to see much of the Endo Expo
because I was at my booth the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent the entire day at my booth
interacting with consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to teach a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to teach everybody about irie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great debate about feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of great breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared a booth with Always Be Flowering
with Medtree Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several other experienced and
great breeders that passed through our
[SPEAKER_00]: booth and came and said, Hi, so that led
to a lot of great conversation and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of great introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I wish I would have gotten to see
a little bit of the Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I saw, there were a lot of
seed vendors and seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I was told, there were over 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we counted at least 23 seed
sellers at the Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Exotic Genetics was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Capulator was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our booth was right down the row from
Brothers Grimm, who is Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethos Genetics had a giant booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of seed sellers and
vendors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that was really popular at
the Indo Expo was LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I saw a whole bunch of was
auto trimming machines, which I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of, but they were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you what I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of auto trimming machines,
also a lot of extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that was really huge this year
at Indo Expo was hemp seed and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the people that approached my
booth on the first day were from out of
[SPEAKER_00]: state and they were looking for bulk hemp
seed that they could take home and start
[SPEAKER_00]: farming hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that was huge was CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, there was an area known as the
Hemp Hallway, and that hallway had all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, there was the Hemp and CBD
Pavilion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large portion of the Indo Expo Center
was dedicated just to hemp and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find anything with CBD in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were dog treats with CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tasted some amazing maple syrup that had
CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was CBD ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were CBD salves and rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were CBD concentrates available in
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you could imagine to put CBD into
was available in that Hemp and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: Pavilion at the Indo Expo this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I didn't get to see a large
portion of the Indo Expo, I still had the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my favorite Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly thought it was going to be
stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that running the booth may give
me a little bit of anxiety, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it went super smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have asked for a better time,
and I honestly had the time of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a huge shout out once
again to everybody that came and said
[SPEAKER_00]: hello, everybody that high-fived me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you just kind of walked by the
booth, and you just gave me that little
[SPEAKER_00]: head nod that people do, or the big eyes,
or maybe you threw up a peace sign,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe you did a little fist bump across
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said what's up to me at Indo Expo,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came to the booth and shook my
hand, if you walked away with some gifts,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you walked away with a shirt,
big up, thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came and said hello, if you came
and said thank you, I appreciate all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It meant the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a big silly smile on my face
from all of the fun I had at the Indo
[SPEAKER_00]: Expo, and I can't wait for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my Indo Expo
wrap-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this was a short, sweet podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had fun hearing about the Indo
Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely, I am going to repost the
trimming episode as the next grow lesson,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be followed by the drying and
curing episode, which will most likely be
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by the clean up and restart
episode, which will conclude my long
[SPEAKER_00]: series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I will start putting out
brand new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got questions, if you've got
some emails, now is a good time to start
[SPEAKER_00]: sending those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start getting them lined up for the
new episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
the long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank you for listening to
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to joining you on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to find me on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Facebook, search for the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, I use my seed company name.
