[SPEAKER_00]: Need a new cool catchphrase or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
all you bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me for episode 487
of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of Cutie Berry live batter
from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of member berry and
Tahitian punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
citrus, berries, and frankincense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've been over this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I for sure get the citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I for sure get the berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so sure about the frankincense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something funky in the background,
something musty, something earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I would agree with
frankincense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it is a delicious and highly
potent concentrate on the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains
67.39% THC and non-detectable amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approve of the Cutie Berry live
batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I'm going to
answer an email that asks a question about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, you know I like to do
some shout-outs to our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout-out and a thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to our new friend, Karen Crawford.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant thank you shout-out to
Tanner M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I always want to send a giant
thank you shout-out to Glenn G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to send a big thank you shout-out
to Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, by the way, Reefer Madness,
congratulations on your first breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue on with the big thank you
shout-out to Paul A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to give a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast high five, a shout-out and a
thank you to my buddy Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you, big shout-out, big respect
to everybody who has continued to support
[SPEAKER_00]: the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show, you can do so by visiting www
[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com forward slash Grow From Your
Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that covers the
business part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was spending most of my evening packing
up seeds for the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at the Endo Expo in Denver on
January 25th and 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 25th is industry and professionals and
business to business day, but the 26th is
[SPEAKER_00]: open to the general public, so I do hope
to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do get your tickets before you travel
because it will sell out and come stock up
[SPEAKER_00]: on some fresh, iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, while I was packing up those
seeds, I was thinking about an email that
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently received, so I thought it might
be a good time to take a break from
[SPEAKER_00]: packing up seeds, take way too many dabs,
and then knock out a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into the email that inspired
today's podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email starts off with a question
about LED lighting, but then it does work
[SPEAKER_00]: into a breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go quickly over the lighting
question, but what I want to focus on this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is the breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff with a G again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this email finds you well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Jeff with a G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff starts off by saying, the reason I am
harassing today is about my first time
[SPEAKER_00]: actually making an honest attempt at
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow lesson compilation was the tits,
and it has inspired me to pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that you thought my grow
lessons were the tits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody has ever told me
that anything I've done was the tits
[SPEAKER_00]: before, so that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am excited that you are now a
grower, and I am excited for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I scored an HPS lamp and two
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a tent, a blower, and a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some heating pads for the floor
and a couple of other things, all for
[SPEAKER_00]: $300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend you clean all of that
equipment before you put any plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but I think you've got a good setup
for a good price so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm sorry that I don't
have all of my specs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in a pile in the basement
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's completely fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question in the message is,
I've listened to your filter placement
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, but I want to still ask if I'm
good blowing directly into my basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially since I'm using the LEDs first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is sort of an odd question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what you were asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in a previous episode,
I've talked about carbon filter placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the air to pass through the carbon
filter before it leaves our grow space so
[SPEAKER_00]: that wherever it goes, it doesn't have
cannabis aroma in it so that air is nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean so nobody smells our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like Jeff with a G wants to blow
the air through the carbon filter out of
[SPEAKER_00]: his tent and directly into the basement,
which is not a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mainly what a lot of folks do who
are growing in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as that basement doesn't overheat,
as long as you're able to get that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there, or as long as it mixes with
enough cool air to stabilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature inside of that tent,
that should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the part about the LEDs that throws
me off here, since I'm especially since
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running the LEDs first, I don't know
why that makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're questioning about
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me another email and kind of
clarify this question and I'll give you
[SPEAKER_00]: further advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a great email because I really
like the second half.
[SPEAKER_00]: This second question is great and we're
going to spend a lot more time focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry I skipped over the first
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure what you're asking
there, but the second part is gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says also after a few sessions,
I'd like to breed and create my own
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I request an episode of breeding terms
and methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is a little esoteric at the
moment and I'm getting ahead of myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love learning about this plant,
especially if you're the teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says I will have many more
questions and updates in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is where I am thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks in advance and keep blazing,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff with a G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the enthusiasm coming from Jeff
with a G.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just got his grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not set up yet and he's already
asking questions about when I breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I do this correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are getting a little bit ahead of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are absolutely correct there,
but this is a good opportunity for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about breeding and breeding labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to focus too much on
breeding methods and too much of my tricks
[SPEAKER_00]: and techniques and stuff like that on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to focus more on the labels and
some of the wording that we see on seed
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of the companies use a
lot of trickery and a lot of mislabels and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of weird word play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if these companies are doing
it because they're trying to sell more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they're trying to word things
fancily so that the consumer is fooled and
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to buy shit that sounds better or if
they don't know how to properly label it
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are the words that they chose
for their packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of different things on
packaging and oftentimes it all means the
[SPEAKER_00]: same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the things we see
on seed packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may actually talk about some things
that we do not see on seed packaging that
[SPEAKER_00]: should probably be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with some of the very
basics, labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will often see the name of the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to pick one of my strains
because it's easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go with Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my listeners know that Arise is
one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about it freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all of the details and I'm not
going to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pick Arise as our strain for the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I label Arise, I write Arise on the
seed package.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know those are Arise seeds in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath Arise, in parentheses,
I put Golden Goat, X, Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are in parentheses together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I put that there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Golden Goat is the female plant
that was used to create Arise and
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker was the male plant that was
used to create the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got an idea of what the genetic
parents of the seeds you have purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That provides you a little bit of
information as to how the plant will grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly what it will taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a little bit of familiarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what Golden Goat is,
you know, oh, I like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you know what Daybreaker is,
you say, oh, I like Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you know what both of them are,
you go, oh, I wonder what that's like when
[SPEAKER_00]: he bred those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we see two strain names in
parentheses with an X in the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: that indicates that those were the crossed
plants that created the named strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that's listed above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you'll see Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then under that, you've got
parentheses, Golden Goat, X, Daybreaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a parentheses to close that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that indicates that Arise is a cross
of Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is another detail that is often
overlooked by many seed makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is proper practice to list ladies first
inside of that parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be proper to list parentheses,
Mother, X, Father, parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that Golden Goat is the female
and Daybreaker was the male in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that is not standard
practice across the board with all
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is proper practice in horticulture,
but not all breeders have adopted this
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to ask the breeder,
what was the male used in your project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can take this even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you will see something in
parentheses with the open and closed
[SPEAKER_00]: parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have Golden Goat, X, Daybreaker in
a set of parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll have another X, then two other
things in a set of parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that indicates that we have taken this
plant in the set of parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably got Golden Goat,
X, Daybreaker in a set of parentheses that
[SPEAKER_00]: made Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got, I'm just going to pick
something else over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we've got parentheses,
Strawberry Fields, X, Blueberry Cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then parentheses to close that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would indicate that we have taken
the progeny of the Strawberry Fields cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to Blueberry Cookies and we've got a male
of that because it is on the right side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the Golden Goat on the left
side of the X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically that would indicate that we
have now crossed the Golden Goat to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael is what the Strawberry Fields to
the Blueberry Cookies cross is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be an indication that we
have crossed Arise to the Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that we do the multiple
sets of parentheses is to kind of show
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents because breeder nerds like
myself and like many of you listening want
[SPEAKER_00]: to know oh yeah, so it's Arise to Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's Arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you want to know that Arise is
Golden Goat to Daybreaker and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael is Strawberry Fields to Blueberry
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to know a little
further back what the genetics are,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the family tree looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fun if you're a nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really do not care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders list that on the packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mainly when you see the parentheses,
that is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it has the parentheses and then a
bunch of words and then an X in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of words and then more
parentheses, that was one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on the left side of your X is
the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on the right side of the X is
your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you close that up and that's one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put an X in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're crossing that to the
other plant, which could be just one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to have something in
parentheses over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have taken Golden Goat to
Daybreaker in parentheses, X, Blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to have a cross on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this makes sense the way I'm
explaining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason this is done, like I said
before, is to let the purchaser,
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer know the pedigree or the
family tree of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes there may be letters at the
ends of those equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have Fs or Ss or Rs and there also
may be numbers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about more of the basic things
we see on some seed packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed packages will indicate a
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are working with photo period seeds,
that flowering time indicates the
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated time in which those seeds will
take to finish flowering once the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage has been initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are growing indoors,
flowering starts the day you switch your
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing outdoors, you have to
pay attention to your calendar,
[SPEAKER_00]: your farmer's almanac, and you also have
to keep an eye on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we are working with photo period
plants from photo period seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time means the amount of time
that the plants will take to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering from the day we initiate the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will veg as long as we keep
them properly fed and they don't get root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound and there are no environmental
factors that make them flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can veg them as long or as short as we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, I veg my plants for seven
to ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: By putting them under 12-12 or 11-13
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I veg my plants for a hundred
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about my goal and what I'm trying
to do with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the estimated flowering time that is
printed on seed packaging is an indication
[SPEAKER_00]: of how long those seeds will take to
finish flowering from the time you
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you are indoors,
day one of your flowering cycle begins the
[SPEAKER_00]: day you turn that timer to 12 hours on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have to keep in mind that many
breeders give you a range of when we can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect those plants to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep in mind that we are
working with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got nature to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been selectively bred
from phenotypes that have been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a good idea of how long they
are going to take to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're bred, we grow a bunch of them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how long they take to finish in
several environments, but they are plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are different phenotypes in
packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to give you an estimated
timeframe in which those plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give about a two week window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say these plants take eight to nine
weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means somewhere between that 55 and
65 day mark, those plants will be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of factors that
contribute to when a plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take the same clone and grow it in
my grow room and grow that same clone in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we pay super close attention,
we will notice that those plants reach
[SPEAKER_00]: peak ripeness at different times in our
different grow rooms, even if we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we offer a timeframe in which we expect
those plants to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to find different phenotypes
and they're going to be grown in different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to give the best estimate we can
based on what our test results have shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my packages say that the plants
will be finished within eight to nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks or nine to 10 weeks or 10 to 11
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sort of range that I like to
put on my packaging to give the consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: to give the grower a good idea of what to
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were growing from a pack of seeds
and you don't know how long those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: take to flower, I always recommend you go
the longest recommended time on the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains really like to beef up the
last seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains really like to beef up the
last five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains do really interesting things
if you let them go past that 63 day mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go to 70 days and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it really beefs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it really gets an interesting aroma
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it turns some really cool colors
that you never would have known about if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't let it go that extra week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the trichomes are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always pay attention to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got the opportunity to let
one plant go longer just as an experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be really satisfied with the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what we're talking about when
we list the flowering time on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: a package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I more often see on
websites, not as commonly on the package
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds because a package of seeds is
very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of space to write a
lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I occupy most of my space with cool
artwork lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I see on a lot of websites is
what is known as morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means what are these plants going
to look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of growth characteristics can we
expect from these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphology is an indicator of what types
of phenotypes we can expect from these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it say short squatty plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it say tall skinny plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it say wide bushy plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we mean by morphology,
shape and characteristics, growth
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and traits we can expect
from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I list that in great detail on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't list that on a lot of my
packaging, but my packaging is ever
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving and ever changing just like my
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may add morphology in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something I do list on
many of my packages and that is aroma and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by aroma and flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what these buds, what these
flowers are going to smell like and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully what they taste like once you
harvest, dry and properly cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that many breeders
include on their packaging is expected
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think expected yield and flavor and
aroma are things that many breeders kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get creative with when it comes to
typing details on their packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: their website descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to be completely honest with
my consumers when I am labeling my
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flavor descriptions are compilations of
what I have smelled, what I have
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced, what I have taste through
multiple phenotypes of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use information from my test
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of friends out there that
test grow my strains before they make it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great reports lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing great jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have many great friends around me
who some of them are cannabis snobs and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are honestly cannabis noobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep all those friends around and
when we have a new thing to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all of their information and I treat
the cannabis noobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their information is just as important to
me as the cannabis snobs because their
[SPEAKER_00]: palate, they say, oh, that tastes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a noob says that tastes just like
tangerines and vanilla cream and a snob
[SPEAKER_00]: says that tastes like tangerines and
vanilla cream, it must be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of their opinions matter to me
equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of people smoke and sample my
products before I put those words on the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do the same with the flowering
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got test growers out there that are
growing stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask all of my testers to keep
detailed notes for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what day they chop down
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know if they're going 55,
62, 72 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend out there right now
running a new strain of mine that is being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested who has been going for 12 weeks and
he's sending me amazing reports every
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting detailed reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my information comes from
that I put on the packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to be completely honest with
the consumers because you know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I sell you some shit and it doesn't do
what you expect, you know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who to email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that for every seed company
and breeder out there, but I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expected yield or harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how much product you're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, not all breeders are
completely honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to use like general terms like
big yields, small yields, medium yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will say this may not be the
fattest yielder in my arsenal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the turps make up for it because
sometimes that's how it is with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know that you are getting
connoisseur grade super stinky cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you may not get a whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be what some growers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be what you need for your
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honest as honest as I could be on my
packaging, the flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, like I said, we try to do our best
when describing flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get really creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are most of the basic things we
will see on a seed package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about some of those
random letters and numbers that we see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain descriptions and in the genetic
listings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to talking about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that set of parentheses
we had earlier with golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: X, daybreaker within that set of
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a female golden goat plant and I
pollinated it with a daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That created Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time that those two
plants met and the first time they hooked
[SPEAKER_00]: up, the first time they met babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the first generation of Arise,
the first filial generation of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that is technically an Arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people may argue that that is a
polyhybrid and they may be correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for this story, we're going to focus
on the F1 hybrid being the accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polyhybrid we'll talk about more way
in the future because that is a way deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's focus on the F1 at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So golden goat and daybreaker,
they hook up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduced these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make some babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those babies, I named them Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first filial generation of
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are Arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of the time you are not going to
see F1 listed on the packaging unless
[SPEAKER_00]: there is an F2 or a further generation
made and that breeder is known or has been
[SPEAKER_00]: known to use that filial generation for
other work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, if you don't see an F
listed on the cross, it is an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have got Arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take an Arise male from that
F1 batch and an Arise female from that F1
[SPEAKER_00]: batch and I breed them together,
their offspring will make the F2
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I would do that is to find
the traits in the F1 that are most
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable and stabilize those traits,
breed them together and make that F2 have
[SPEAKER_00]: the traits I want even stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, we kind of
eliminate other traits that we aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to stabilize those desirable traits,
I would find a male from that F2 batch and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a female from the F2 batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would breed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that subsequent offspring,
the progeny, would be known as the F3
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just continues that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time a breeder will take that
to F3 or F4 and they will have locked in
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact traits they are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those seeds will actually grow
like clones of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have very stable genetics by the
time you are to the F5 or F6 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a moment ago, I talked about
polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyhybrids are quite often overlooked in
the world of cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people, including myself,
are breeding with polyhybrids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually being called F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about polyhybrids versus F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: A polyhybrid is basically what most people
are calling an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: A polyhybrid is when you take a strain
like Daybreaker and a strain like Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat and you breed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those create a new cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be considered an F1, but it is
actually a polyhybrid because the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: were not worked for stability for singled
desirable traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is kind of a vague blanket
statement to cover the term polyhybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I talk about proper F1s,
it will make more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: By breeding with an F1 version of
Daybreaker and an F1 version of Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat, I did not have the opportunity to
lock in the traits of my parent plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that I got offspring that showed
those plants and not their grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proper way to do it would to have
taken the Golden Goat and worked the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat to F3, F4, or maybe F5 until I
locked in the traits that I was searching
[SPEAKER_00]: for on the Golden Goat side of the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I looking for on the Golden Goat
side?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted that sweet tropical flavor and
that potency, but then from the Daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: side, I also wanted that cushy stankiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to see what happened when I
put two plants that were completely
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite together and I hit the goal with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But proper breeding would have been to
breed the Golden Goat until I locked in
[SPEAKER_00]: the traits that I wanted and then also
breed the Daybreaker to the F3,
[SPEAKER_00]: the F4, possibly the F5 or F6 generation
to really lock in the traits I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for there, then breed those together and
make the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, that would have made a more
stable cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have less variation in
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is I only had one Golden Goat
because Golden Goat is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did not have the opportunity to work
that unless I did a back cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about back crossing in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that was not my goal with
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to put that super tropical
Golden Goat to the super dank and stanky
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush looking Daybreaker and kind of
create that polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my intention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is often confused as an F1 is the
point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, crossing two F1s that were not
stabilized makes a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to get some emails
about that because that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fumbled through that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't have a lot of notes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't plan on talking about
polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few more things I did mention
BX just a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a BX?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that I've made a Golden Goat
BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is only available in a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never a male Golden Goat
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is what's known as a clone
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder, Mr. Dank from Topeka,
Kansas, never put out a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made feminized seeds of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available in FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of consumers do not want feminized
seeds, but they still want a shot at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have created a Golden Goat BX and
I'll tell you how I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Golden Goat BX starts, of course,
with a Golden Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated that Golden Goat female with
a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is how Arise was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a really good reason for using
the Daybreaker male to create a Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traits of Golden Goat and Daybreaker
are very obviously visibly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat has long, thin, skinny,
pointy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker makes big fat white leaves that
you could fucking camp under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bred them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I grew out a bunch of the seeds and
took very close notes on how these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I found a male that looked exactly
like my female Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male had the exact same plant
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male took the same amount of time to
go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male smelled exactly the same on the
stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male smelled exactly like Golden Goat
late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part about this male was that the
leaves look just like the female Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat to the extent that it had the exact
same number of serrations on the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and the leaf tips did the same exact
little curling thing that the Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: female did when I overfed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a beautiful replica of my Golden
Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell that it did not have much
of the Daybreaker traits to it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: did not show any Daybreaker traits at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't act like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't grow like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly did not look like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was confident that I had a very
Golden Goat dominant male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that Golden Goat dominant male and
put that pollen on the original female
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have back crossed because I have out
crossed that Golden Goat to the Daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: and it made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I found a male in there that looks
just like the female and I put that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: back on the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that came out of there are a
Golden Goat back cross one which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled as a BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I were to grow those and find
another male that was even a more close
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of that original female
Golden Goat and back cross that onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: original female again, that would be a
BX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately for me, I did enough work
finding my first male that I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that back cross is a very close
representation of the original Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody who has grown it has been
satisfied with the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a back cross indicated as a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason for that is to make
something available in seed form that was
[SPEAKER_00]: not available in seed without making it in
a feminized form because many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm actually going to work my way into
some feminized seed labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have a strong bias against
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how feminized seeds are made
and how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are a great option for a
grower who is limited on numbers or a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower who needs every seed they plant to
be a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the need for feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how they are labeled
We're not going to talk too much about how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're made today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about how we label
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most often when it comes to feminized
seeds, you will see either an R or an S
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about S.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see something like a Golden Goat
S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make Golden Goat S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That S indicates the word self.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have done, I have taken a female
Golden Goat plant and I've made two
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them I have decided is going to be
treated with a solution that will become
[SPEAKER_00]: my pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is going to be a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets left alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: She becomes my pollen receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat the selected plant with a solution
that causes that plant to create pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that only contains female chromosomes
because there are no male chromosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat it with a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen is all female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that female pollen on to the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have taken Golden Goat female
pollen and put it on a Golden Goat female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcome is all female Golden Goat
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since there have not been any other
genetics introduced into that project,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is known as a self, an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Golden Goat S1 represents a Golden Goat
self seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A female Golden Goat that was reversed and
that pollen was applied to a Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to move forward and talk
about an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take that Golden Goat pollen,
which I spoke of before, and I apply that
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat pollen to any other female
plant, the resulting seeds are R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is a female lemon skunk
plant, which was pollinated by a reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat plant, reversed R,
reversed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reversal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar to the F1 that I spoke
of much earlier in the show, but I used
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So S indicates self and R indicates
reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self means I did it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: R means reversed pollen that was put onto
different plants to create different
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may see S2 and R2 and things of
that nature, but those are very less
[SPEAKER_00]: common than an F2 and F3 or R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a BX2 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common indicator you're going to
see on a feminized seed is usually going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be that S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see Blueberry Cookies S1 or Golden
Goat S1, that means that that plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: simply used, reversed, pollinated itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no other genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find those to be highly desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a strain that I need to
preserve, let's just pick a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing Lemon G for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got bored with it, but I didn't
want to give it up forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got Lemon G, feminized seeds
stashed away in a stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got just enough of them to where I
think when I grow them, I will find very
[SPEAKER_00]: close representations of the original
Lemon G because there are no other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics added to that gene pool and every
seed I've got is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very great way to preserve a
seed line if there's a reason why you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to get rid of that Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I gave clones of it to Tenasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave clones of it to everybody around me
so that it could live, so that it could
[SPEAKER_00]: survive, so that it could get spread,
but I no longer have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I choose to have it again,
I've got the Lemon G S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is proper etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grow those Lemon G S1s,
if I share the clone, I will label it
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when I put the buds in a bag,
they will be labeled Lemon G S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if there's a variance,
if there's a difference, if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis patient that smokes Lemon
G and it works beautifully for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dupe them into thinking
they got Lemon G when they just got my
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is proper etiquette as a grower,
as a bro, as a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like we have covered R1 and S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered most of the feminized talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered the male and female talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way toward talking about A
and B lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a breeder that we all know quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's dominating the damn seed game right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say his name or his brand
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to put out A and B lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are confused by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it to be a great idea and I
understand what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk a little bit about A and B
lines when it comes to breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and releasing these packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about polyhybrids and F1s
and stabilized strains earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the word work a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To work a strain means that you have
either bred it to something or you've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken it a further generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've out crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have done some work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about really working a strain
as a breeder to get sought after desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, it is important to start
with a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that goal is a couple of traits
in a specific plant that we are really
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to narrow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have two plants that we see great
potential in and we want to breed them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we may not be able to get there by
making an F1 or what is more properly
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled, a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we breed that together,
our phenotypes are going to vary widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% will probably look like the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% will probably look like the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other 50% are going to be mixed
mashes in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on what your goal was,
you may have hit your goal on this first
[SPEAKER_00]: round of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want more reliable seeds,
there's a better way to go about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes much more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that my new goal is to cross
these two plants I just got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get the potency of this
plant and the flavor of this plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: one solid hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to put that to market so that
you guys can purchase it and you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you can be completely satisfied
with your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easy and quick way to doing this is to
get a male of one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another female of the opposite strain
and pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, 25% of that progeny is going to look
like the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the progeny will look like the
father.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 50% are going to be variations
of the mom and dad and different
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of possibly the grandparents
and the mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I am okay with that, my project
can be done or I can take it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really want to lock in the potency
from that one strain and the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other strain and have reliable offspring,
I need to work this further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I could continue just to work the F
generations down the line and hope that I
[SPEAKER_00]: get that potency and that flavor that I'm
really looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just working the F1 and then
finding an F1 male and an F1 female that
[SPEAKER_00]: look like they're going to do what I need
done and breed them together and continue
[SPEAKER_00]: down that path working for both of those
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to do this would be to work
two separate lines of the same project and
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on the potency in one line and the
flavor on the other line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say that line A is the potency
and line B is the flavor, but it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have still crossed the two parents,
except I have selected different offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm focusing on different traits in
two completely different breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on how much space,
how much time, how many plants I can
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicate to this, I may be able to do both
of these projects simultaneously and fast
[SPEAKER_00]: track this whole project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I am limited by plant
counts and space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have to run the A line as one
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can breed that to my desired uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can work on the B line,
breed that to my desired uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about the next step after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would be doing is I would take
the line A, I'm looking for potency over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what I aimed the line A as,
but we're going to say A is potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would breed F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find the most potent phenotype out
of there I could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would breed that to an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would find the most potent
phenotype I could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't worry about the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't worry too much about the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be paying too many attention to
the other details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would only have maybe one or two things
I'm really focused on, the aroma and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably shape and structure or what I'm
after on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to breed that all the
way to like F3, F4, maybe five or six,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how long it takes me to lock
in those traits that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want 75 to 80% of my seeds that I sprout
to come out looking just like what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need that uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get there, I'll put that project on
hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a bunch of those F5 or F6 seeds
and I stash them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about those in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to work line B.
[SPEAKER_00]: On line B, I am only working for that
flavor I was searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking for, today we're just going
to say strawberry bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the flavor I'm seeking,
any phenotype that doesn't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry bubblegum dominance,
it's getting cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to find the most strawberry
bubblegum dominant phenotype I can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to breed that to an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in that F2 batch, find the most
strawberry bubblegum dominant phenotype I
[SPEAKER_00]: can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed that to F3 and keep going until I
get absolute uniformity around F5,
[SPEAKER_00]: F6, however far it takes me to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the uniformity I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got what I've considered my A
line and my B line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got new cross, which is super potent
line A and new cross, which is super
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorful line B.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same cross, but they've been
bred, selectively bred for different
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders will release the F1s of
those on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders may release the F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders may release one line of that
and not even let you know that there's a B
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in breeding, it is not uncommon to run
an A and a B line and focus on one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable traits on both of those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find a phenotype from line A that holds
that potency we are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we find a phenotype from line B that
holds that flavor we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we breed those F5 or those F6s
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a brand new, real F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is no longer a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a true bred, solid F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like we have gone full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got lost earlier on a ramble
about polyhybrids, but there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I wrapped that one up with a
nice little bow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the long rant about the
difference in the A line and the B line
[SPEAKER_00]: and why sometimes we see A lines and B
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just different breeding for
different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, we combine the A and
the B to create that super hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: that brand new F1 that has the desirable
traits that are locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you want to be a real nerd,
you can start F2ing that and you can lock
[SPEAKER_00]: in traits even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding gets addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more type of breeding written
down that I really want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: before I start wrapping up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of the total opposite of
working with an A and a B line or some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is called open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open pollination is basically a big old
plant orgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you put multiple males and
multiple females in a room and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get females that have been
pollinated by this male and this male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one female plant will contain several
different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an opportunity for a lot of
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open pollination can be done with all the
same strain or open pollination can be
[SPEAKER_00]: done by mixing strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it would be done with all of
the same strain is to find diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I put two males of Arise and
four females of Arise, all different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes in the room, and I just let
those two males pollinate all four of
[SPEAKER_00]: those females, we're going to have a lot
of different combinations of offspring,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will give me a lot of opportunity to
find a lot of great winners to breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I put two Arise males and four Arise
females in a room and I did a pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be known as an Arise open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they were all F1s I put in there,
there would be an Arise F2 open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination and it would be polite on the
packaging or somewhere in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, hey, I used two Arise males and I
pollinated four females and these are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seeds that came from all of that
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an open pollination and that is
very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the reason that is great is
because it will create a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really open up the gene pool and
give you a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people will do an open
pollination by putting one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: different males in with multiple different
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not ideal to me because I'm really
picky and I like to know what everything
[SPEAKER_00]: was pollinated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just trying to create seeds
to play with for the future and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: too worried about genetics, about
heritage, about pedigree, that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also find a lot of great
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the only thing I don't like about
that is we don't know what they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to some people that is not important
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people in some places that
don't have access to more seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just growing the seeds that they
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be tired of all the same old shit
they've been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a great way to diversify your
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my talk on open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about F1s and F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about S1s, R1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to listen back and see if I got my
part about polyhybrids right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also need to review the part about A and
B lines and make sure I said that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have very minimal notes here in front
of me so I need to go back and make sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: said things correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank our friend Jeff with a G
for a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a grow
question or perhaps you need to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: correction on this episode, my email
address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I would love to hear from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also look forward to seeing you at the
Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me at the Indo Expo in Denver,
Colorado on January 25th and 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 25th is Business to Business
Professionals Day, but the 26th is open to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend you buy your tickets for
the Expo before you make your travel plans
[SPEAKER_00]: because the Indo Expo will sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come by my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come take a selfie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting you at the Indo
Expo.

Hey, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really rough these past couple
of years to meet you, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't take it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time for you to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about the things you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about the things you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hurting you is the last thing I wanna
do, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't go on living a lie when God
knows how much I've tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: To love and treat you every way that I
should, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I see that holding on to something not
good is always what temptations got me
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But baby, it's time to say goodbye to this
love we share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye to this love we
share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[SPEAKER_01]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work hard each day and night trying to
make our love life right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to you, all I do is never good,
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been at this same place before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And God knows I can't take no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry days for me have gone out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that holding on to something
not good is always what temptations got me
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But baby, I gotta say goodbye to this love
we share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye to this love we
share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never meant to hurt you, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never meant to hurt you, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a man's gotta do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a man's gotta do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I heard about the things you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about the things you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hurting you is the last thing I want
to do, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't go on living this lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And God knows how much I've tried to love
and treat you every way that I should,
[SPEAKER_02]: baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye.
[SPEAKER_02]: To this love we share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye.
[SPEAKER_02]: To this love we share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to say goodbye, baby.
Time to say goodbye.
