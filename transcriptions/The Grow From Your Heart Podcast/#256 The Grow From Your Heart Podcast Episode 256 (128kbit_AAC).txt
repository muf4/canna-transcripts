[SPEAKER_01]: for letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Koo, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I also want to send
a huge shout out to all of my friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: just joined me on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing Instagram Live videos
occasionally, and it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts me in the mood to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me some ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me conversational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great way for me to hang out
and take a couple of dabs with my social
[SPEAKER_01]: media following.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is watching the Instagram Live video?
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the support and interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not following me on Instagram,
make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's irey underscore genetics,
I-R-I-E underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you can join us and watch the
live videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll answer your questions on the
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll answer your question on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get inspired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was doing the Instagram video,
I was taking some fat dabs of some,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some chem four from concentrate supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supply company and I was dunking it into
this delicious chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called sugar wax, but it was more
like a slurry, more like a sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciated the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dumped the chem four shatter into the
chem four slurry and it made a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made a whole bunch of lung expansion
and it got me, obviously it got me super
[SPEAKER_01]: high and super chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great work to our friends at
concentrate supply company for the
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to give a huge shout out to
our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need some new seeds for your
garden, go check out Hella Dank Seed Co at
[SPEAKER_01]: dankseed.store or simply search on Google

[SPEAKER_01]: They do different deals that will suit
your needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some Googling, do your research,
see what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody out there growing
from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what's next on our order of
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, you guys, Stitcher will
not load episode 253.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've reposted it several different ways,
different times, different methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: different plans of attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of know what I'm doing with my RSS
feed and I cannot get Stitcher to load
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 253.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are going to say change the
file name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed that file name to something
random and it still would not pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reposted it several different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes would get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Podfeed would get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My website would get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Website would pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, Stitcher just did not
want to pick up number 253.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I emailed Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always take for damn ever to reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Stitcher, if you're listening,
please help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my episodes won't load.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wait for them to reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they will say something back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if they can fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't respond, I will go back to
trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been overwhelmed with stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, the Throwback Thursday
episode didn't appear as it should have
[SPEAKER_01]: today this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go manually repost that at 420 PM
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what's going on with
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything will be fixed as soon as I can
get them to reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying, but it's kind of a Stitcher
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's their service because it
works everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works on my website, which isn't
anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up in iTunes, which is the main
podcast server.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up in Podbean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up in Podbay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows up in all the other podcast
services.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's got to be a Stitcher
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if you are a Stitcher
listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell that I'm missing listens
because my ranking is slipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually at like a thousand or better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually somewhere between 600 and a
thousand in the rankings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not anywhere near that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get Stitcher fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get everybody the information and
knowledge that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: People rely on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize One thing I can do to get it
going while Stitcher is messing up is I
[SPEAKER_01]: can make more YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've posted several YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that like the first 103,
maybe 105 YouTube videos are up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart podcast YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not subscribed to the YouTube
channel, go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 19 or 20 videos are on the old
iGrowCulture channel, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: playlist on the Grow From Your Heart
podcast channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 19 or 20 are right there on that
playlist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on the playlist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get you that playlist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to the first 19 or 20, then all the
way up to like 103, 105 are all right
[SPEAKER_01]: there on the Grow From Your Heart podcast
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will keep updating it until I get caught
up to current.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a little bit of time,
but I just did some upgrades to my
[SPEAKER_01]: computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly did some downgrades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just deleted a whole bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the computer goes way faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe now I can do more video editing a
little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get more videos up for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I can do when stuff fails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find new ways to try to compensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But check out the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, let's talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rambling on for like five or six
minutes and I haven't spoken much about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep you guys updated on my most
recent breeding projects and I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: spoken much about it on a couple of
episodes, but I've got an Arise male in a
[SPEAKER_01]: room with several females.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal right now is to make a few new
crosses because I've been inspired and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few new clones that I want to
pollinate and make a few new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some great ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also going to replenish some seeds
that I've got available commercially that
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting low in stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some familiar plants and some
new plants in the breeding room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the familiar old stuff is like
there's a grateful dog in there so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can make more of the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a prana in there so that,
or a flow in there so that I can make more
[SPEAKER_01]: prana.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of Arise females in
there so that I can make more Arise seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Hell's OG in there so that I can
make more of the Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the new stuff that's in there is what
has gotten me excited and probably you all
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I put a Kosher Kush female in there
that will be pollinated by the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to try to name that
until I grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got name recommendations,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Jewish names would be cool because I
call my male plant King Solomon and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some Jewish attachment
to the name, maybe some Torah relations to
[SPEAKER_01]: the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's strawberry fields in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a Zach Hayes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys know anything about Zach
Hayes, that's a strawberry cough plant
[SPEAKER_01]: bred to the killer Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were two of my friend Zach Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: His real name was Zach Hayes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zach Hayes was bred for my friend Zach
Hayes who actually passed away of cystic
[SPEAKER_01]: fibrosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a great young man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a great dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a cannabis advocate and he was just
a great dude all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Zach Hayes was bred for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends at Organica got me a clone of
that and now I am putting pollen from my
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise on that and I will return a bunch of
the seeds to our friends at Organica and
[SPEAKER_01]: we will see what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, but it needs a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a cool name for Zach to
Arise, let me know now that you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also space bitch number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred space bitch number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think many people, I gave out a
few clones of that a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody's got it alive
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space bitch number three is of course
space queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a really pungent, like a rotten
mango fruity kind of smelling phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: and I pollinated that with my grateful dog
and that made space bitch number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was of course number three because it
was just the third seed that I planted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I labeled the cups one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I went up to number eight and that
was number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three and four were the keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three is the one that stuck around for the
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there is ecto cooler in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot recall the cross on ecto cooler
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some DK in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some other cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ecto cooler was bred by Tierra Rojo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect some great shit to come from the
Arise to ecto cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should be a fun cross to come up
with the name for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can think of any names for ecto
cooler to Arise, I'd love to hear your
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send your suggestions to me on Twitter at
GFYH Podcast or email them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know what you think I should
name those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, all of those girls are in the
flowering room and the male is dumping
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and it is just about pollen time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably when I'm done recording here,
I'm going to wrap up the dreadlocks in
[SPEAKER_01]: something real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put on different clothes and
I'm going to go in there and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: smack that male around and make sure he
gets pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn off all the fans, turn off all
the blowers so that I have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: control over where the pollen goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go smack that male so he
shoots his dust everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him a good shake and then I'm going
to take a bud off of him and just rub that
[SPEAKER_01]: one bud of male flowers all over a couple
of females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a whole bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollination is happening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pollination time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just shy of 30 days into flower with
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means in about 30, 35 days ish,
these seeds will be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means I'll get to take them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the plants dry up, I'll get to see
what I have created.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the funnest part of breeding
is seeing what you have created.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way to segue into the topic
of this show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to talk about breeding a lot and
I'm known for a lot of my breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects and my breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people approach the subject of
breeding, they seem to be overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to think that breeding is some
sorcery, some magician's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, breeding is the most natural
thing that cannabis plants can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing cannabis plants without seeds is
actually the trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were able to produce cannabis that
does not have seeds in it and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and smokable, you yourself are
able to make seeds for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to make a small batch of
seeds, I'm going to give you some advice
[SPEAKER_01]: on an idea that I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not perfected this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to work on this idea
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am certain this would work for a small
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about what I have
called single pot breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this could be a book,
but I want to give it to everybody right
[SPEAKER_01]: now for free because I love you guys and I
think it's a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a great way in one pot,
in one small space with one light for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to create enough seeds for yourself to
play with and maybe share a few with your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you don't have to buy more
seeds and you can start your own breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects and see that it's not wizardry,
that it's something that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've grown a crop to fruition,
if you've made a plant live that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: nine or 10 weeks through a flowering
cycle, you are able to breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a strong enough light,
you are able to breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clear my throat real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a couple of drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably take another dab and get my
throat all choked up again, but I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the power of editing,
I'll be back before you can blink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will talk about single pot
breeding and how you can make enough seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: with one pot, with one light, in one very
small grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world, I just noticed
something funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was recording, our friend Jesse
sent me a message and he pointed out that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a vendor who sells cannabis seeds
online and he claimed to have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: iry genetic seeds that are honestly sold
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he's got them, they're rare fucking
collector's items and you might want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get on there, but I know that they're not
what he claims they are because those are
[SPEAKER_01]: simply not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's way too late to have those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those probably don't even exist anymore
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy claims he's got heart of gold
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy claims he's got grateful dog
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also claims he's got tons of seeds from
all kinds of other vendors and breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: that it doesn't seem like it's even
realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he doesn't have my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never bought anything from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most of where my stuff is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying is that Graybeard
Seeds, the ultimate seed bank at
[SPEAKER_01]: graybeardseeds.com is not an official
distributor, vendor, representative of iry
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics products in any way, shape or
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a picture of Jerry Garcia up
as their picture, as their icon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry's not part of their seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fall for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't recommend that you troll them and
email them and or contact them and let
[SPEAKER_01]: them know that they suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't say to do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm a podcaster and this goes out
and I don't want to get myself in any
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that you don't contact them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you don't harass them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you don't let them know
that they're a fraud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let them be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ignore them and let them continue as
usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my friends that support me and
love me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't do me any favors by reaching
out to these people and disrupting their
[SPEAKER_01]: business for being completely fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I asked you guys to do
something like that, it could backfire and
[SPEAKER_01]: get me in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't do anything like that on
my behalf because I clearly did not ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you for all of your help and
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my main whole point of pressing pause
was to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I saw that Jesse messaged me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to press pause again now
that I told you guys about what Jesse
[SPEAKER_01]: messaged me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go back and message Jesse
that he needs to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm actually going to take the
dabs that I press pause to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, please hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of poking around that website a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really a lot of ways to
contact them through looking at the app on
[SPEAKER_01]: my phone or at their website on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe you'll find more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was talking about single pot
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't have a lot of
space, that you're interested in making a
[SPEAKER_01]: few seeds for yourself, why not breed in
just one pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not into the one pot idea,
we can also call it one light breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just say every time I say one
pot, you just say three or four three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots, however many you can fit
under your light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about light for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to breed under anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly wouldn't go smaller than a
400.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, but you're not going to make a
lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be a lot of viable
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a 600 watt light,
that's just about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand watt, you're golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 will be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to make a lot of
white seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get enough seeds just
to make it worth your time and effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just won't be any good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would stick with the 400 or bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 600 is probably your best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just trying to breed for
personal seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm talking small spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a lot of people out there are
growing in like a five by five hydro hut
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe a small closet or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I say single light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got the idea of a single pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's to stop you from getting one semi
large pot, like maybe a seven gallon and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting three pot, three plants in that
seven gallon pot, three small clones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, once you put them in the
dirt, you've got six, maybe 10 inches
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking out and you veg them up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get them all about 12 inches
tall, maybe eight inches, 18 inches tall
[SPEAKER_01]: or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you use like a tomato cage or
three sticks to spread them out to where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not all growing straight up the
center of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to spread them out to where you
give a little bit of space in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe top them, veg them out until they're
like 18, 24 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of those is your male.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the plants in that three,
the trio of plants, there is your boy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other two are your females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got an indica and a sativa in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be better if you don't do a full
indica and a full sativa because your
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering times will be wonky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd want them a little closer together,
but it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll make enough seeds for yourself
if that's your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But put two strands that are similar in
there or two females of the same type,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then one male in there and flower that
out in that one pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can make enough seeds for
yourself with one space, one light,
[SPEAKER_01]: one pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason this would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of great reasons why
this would be helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One reason, maybe if something goes wrong,
it looks like you've only got one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having three plants,
you're only going to get in trouble for
[SPEAKER_01]: one, should something happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how well that'll work for
you, but you've only got one pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can only have one plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason why this would be helpful
is because now you've only got to water
[SPEAKER_01]: one pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've got three plants in there,
but you've only got to mix up enough
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and enough water to water that
one pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're somebody that works a lot,
if you're somebody that can't be home
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly, a seven gallon pot is going to
stay wet for like three, maybe four days,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on your environment in your
small grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll buy you time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've only got one pot to water and it
reduces numbers and it saves you floor
[SPEAKER_01]: space because you don't have so many pots
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've only got one pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that eventually,
once you're done pollinating, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to cut down that male plant and it's going
to give you a little bit more space in
[SPEAKER_01]: that pot, so it will be less crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can probably fit three or four
plants in a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could flower it all in the same pot
under one 400 watt light, use very little
[SPEAKER_01]: space, and then you can make your own
personal seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about the same thing,
but let's change up the plan of attacking
[SPEAKER_01]: the method just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you've got maybe, I like saying
a five by five hydro hut, those are very
[SPEAKER_01]: available and it doesn't have to be a
hydro hut, just whatever grow hut you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get, get a quality one or a small five by
five space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I like for a one light
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk like a five by five hydro
hut with maybe like a 400 watt light in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, maybe a 600 watt light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a duct on top to get the heat
and the stale air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would do in a five by five hut,
I would run a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hang it from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would run the ducting from the filter
through the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would run, I would have a vented
light or a ducted light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would run the ducting up right out
of the top and I would set the blower
[SPEAKER_01]: right on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the outside of the hut,
just resting on the roof and it's sucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got ducting attached to it and it's
sucking the air through the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_01]: over the light and out of the top of the
hut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're extracting air that has
been filtered and doesn't stink out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will pull fresh air in through the
vents in the bottom of the hut while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're pulling that old stale air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll also be cooling the light at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one blower is serving multiple
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon filter, ducting, light,
ducting, blower, resting on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're just blowing that heat
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all you have to do is get that heat
out of whatever room you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That heat has to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so you got a 500 or a five by
five hut or like a four or a 600 watt
[SPEAKER_01]: light in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to do a single pot,
here's another method that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered works very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do this for breeding or I like
to do this personally for running new
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I make new seeds, I've got a lot of
them and I want to grow them, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a whole bunch of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to grow some small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'll do in that situation is I will
use very small pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to use four or six inch net
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Amazon, you can find a five
or six inch net pots used for hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fairly cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a pack of 24 for not much
money at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably get free shipping a pack
of 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use the method I'm talking about,
you'll have enough for two runs and they
[SPEAKER_01]: are reusable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what I like to do, I like to get the
six inch net pots and I like to fill them
[SPEAKER_01]: with a very aerated cocoa, like 50% cocoa,
50% perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill it almost all the way to the top
and I'll put my clones right inside there
[SPEAKER_01]: or my seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will sprout it and get it, I'll
germinate it and I'll get it growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll put it into the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I take, I get Tupperware or
Rubbermaid dishes from Walmart or Target
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're only like six, maybe five,
maybe eight, inches tall at the most and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just made for like storing clothes
underneath the bed or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have wheels on them,
but I like to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about three feet long and then
they're probably 18 inches wide and I like
[SPEAKER_01]: to put five of the six inch net pots per
Rubbermaid container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a row of three and a row of two
and they fit like three and then two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they don't fit side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not parallel, they're staggered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you know what I mean,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got five per tub and I do two tubs
under one light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got 10 of those and the six
inch net pots and when I put them into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa the first time, I'll water from the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will water those plants with a lot of
mammoth microbes plus life from veg bloom,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of veg bloom base,
maybe a little liquid karma, maybe Kalmag
[SPEAKER_01]: if it needs it and then a little bit of
carbohydrates depending on what brand of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates I'm working with at the
time, but I'll add some carbs in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want to focus on the root
development at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I will water it from the top at
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put the clone into the cocoa and
water it from the top just like normal,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the cocoa saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I set them into the Rubbermaid dish
and slide them under the one light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's the last time those plants get
watered from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I mix up a three gallon or a five
gallon jug of water every Monday and shake
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit out of it and divide it in half
and pour two and a half gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to save some.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if I do the five gallon
container, I only try to do about one and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half to two gallons of water per
Rubbermaid container and I fill it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's honestly I've got long fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a little more than up to the
second knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be an inch and a half,
maybe two inches deep worth of water just
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in there and it works because
those net pots have so much space up top
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're still getting air and they're
not drowning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water only sits in there that deep
for like an hour before all the cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wicks it right up and then you've
got like one knuckle deep worth of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and that sits there for a couple of days
and the plants just absorb all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drink it all up from the roots as the
roots get dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the cocoa gets dry, it wicks it right
up and keeps it going in there and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: let that go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I can water it on Monday or
Sunday night and then I can work
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout most of the week and I don't
have to add water until maybe Thursday or
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually today's Thursday and I put just a
little bit of fresh water on top to top it
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watered it Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got dried up by Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just added some fresh water on there so
that I'm not adding, I didn't even add
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just added fresh water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll probably rock until like Saturday
or Sunday and then Saturday I'll take the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll set them on the floor and I'll take
those Tupperware dishes and clean them out
[SPEAKER_01]: real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just hose them out outside in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll bring them back in and then I'll
remix more water and then I'll pour that
[SPEAKER_01]: three gallons and divide the three gallons
up by the two tubs and set them in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and let it rock just like that under the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll do a small breeding project
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm making new stuff, that's often how
I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm running new seeds, that's often how
I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can do 10 small plants under one
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can do even more if you want
to do another Tupperware dish and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: just veg them for a very short time just
until they're, you know, like maybe eight
[SPEAKER_01]: inches tall and then you flower them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't veg for very long and then that
way you can see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just running a 400 watt light,
that's enough space for that many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what you made if you're
running new seeds or you can make plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend if you're going to do it that
way, do a male separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the male in a saucer and set him to
the side because he's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminated once he pollinates anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't waste your space in that
Rubbermaid dish for the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put the male in there and water the
saucer so that you could take out the
[SPEAKER_01]: saucer, eliminate him once everybody gets
grown real well and once everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great way to run a semi-large
number of plants in a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also do the same thing with beer
cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't want to spend the money on
the six inch net pots, you can fit more
[SPEAKER_01]: beer cups in the same amount of space and
you can use the Tupperware container as
[SPEAKER_01]: your reservoir, as your base like I like
to do, as my hydro table.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're running that many plants,
you have to worry about the rules and the
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fit a lot more beer cups under
that light and you can get them real close
[SPEAKER_01]: together and grow them up until they're
about three or four inches tall and then
[SPEAKER_01]: flower them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what you've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to pollinate those at that
height, you certainly can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a bunch of seeds from a
really short crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my idea started with a single pot to
stay legal and get away from all the large
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to go with large numbers,
just use beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you poke holes in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a drill and I stack like
five or six cups together and go straight
[SPEAKER_01]: through the bottom three or four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I actually like to go through the
side right about, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe half an inch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go right through the side of the cup
four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be filling the
reservoir and you're using the cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't go as deep because you will
start to get root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not as much drainage happening,
not as much oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a good idea to put an air
stone to get one of those aquarium air
[SPEAKER_01]: stones with the two, that come off and
drop one air stone in each reservoir of
[SPEAKER_01]: water to keep the oxygen level in there
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're using well aerated cocoa
with the net pots, you should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using beer cups, you certainly
need oxygen flowing in that water or it
[SPEAKER_01]: will get funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treat it kind of like hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measure your PPMs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just let it flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing brand new seeds,
I like to let new seeds go nine to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pollinating to make new seeds,
let that go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably have pollination start
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not touching anything,
the pollen will start dropping around day
[SPEAKER_01]: 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in there and smack the plant one time
around day 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have heavy pollination by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until about day 65 to cut that stuff
down, let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've just made a tester batch of
seeds with one light, possibly one pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly a Tupperware dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just depends on what method you chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, something I should mention that just
dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do the Tupperware
method with the water in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is cold as shit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it's Colorado where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's winter time, it's getting cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the house, the floor is cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that Tupperware container up off the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put something underneath it to where
it's not touching the floor to where you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get it a little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water in there will get cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will cause you problems right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Cali and it's not cold,
don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're somewhere like I am right
now, starting to get super chilly,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't let that water get real cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it may sound like I'm
oversimplifying things, but if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do stuff for yourself in your
house, and you don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: resources, it shouldn't be as intimidating
as a lot of people think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can breed, just like I said,
under one light in very, very minimal
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, and you can have great
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't scare yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overcomplicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overthink things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people make mistakes in
the grow by overthinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cause problems by overthinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people come to me for advice on the
internet, and they're like, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them, dude, smoke a joint,
go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then come back and look at your
plants, and the answer will come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be so freaked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be so panicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be overthinking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just driving yourself crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we do with most of life,
honestly, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to overanalyze things, overthink it,
look too deep into things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start fucking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just see what you see and accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overthink the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants grow, like I've said it
several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kush grows on a mountain, on a Kush
mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A goat peed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got a bunch of wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got a bunch of rocks thrown at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a happy plant and it survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where it's all from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban poison is from Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a Durban poison plant that won't
grow in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't figure out what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We quit giving it water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from random places with random
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't come from place.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these plants were, they didn't
happen naturally in a grow room,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sterile facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were on a mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in a jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in a forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in shitty climates, getting
pissed on by goats, getting chewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: at by bats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Random, terrible things were happening to
these plants and they survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be scared to take it and treat it
like a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a puppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can take some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you may kill some plants in your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've killed a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've killed a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I learned to be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only post really cool things to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only tell you about really cool
experiences on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten spider mites a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had powdery mildew before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have fucked up trays of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time when I was a new grower,
I got too stoned and fell asleep and left
[SPEAKER_01]: a grow room door open all night and seeded
the entire fucking crop and hermed the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to try new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't be afraid to not treat this
plant like it's a princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it weed for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear it if you decide to use
any of my new growing techniques I taught
[SPEAKER_01]: you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to breed in a single pot,
if you're going to breed in several small
[SPEAKER_01]: pots, if you're going to breed in the
little tray and six-inch net pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you're going to grow in the six-inch
net pots like I recommended, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reach out to me at
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will answer your questions personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take me a minute to get to them,
but I'm doing my best to answer each one
[SPEAKER_01]: personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I want to thank
everybody for listening to episode number
[SPEAKER_01]: 256 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to sponsor the podcast or if
you've got a product you'd like me to
[SPEAKER_01]: review, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it's Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love it if you find me on social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stalk me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram, it's iree, underscore,
genetics, I-R-I-E, underscore,
[SPEAKER_01]: G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, I do some Instagram live
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be fun to have you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see your comments,
love to get your input, see what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to remind you again about the
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep writing down the word email,
so growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not into the social media and
you'd like to reach out, the email is the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, don't forget that I put out
throwback Thursday episodes every
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I do that is because iTunes and
Stitcher only hold 100 episodes in their
[SPEAKER_01]: feed, and I've got 256 episodes out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there are episodes people
cannot find in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am putting all the episodes together in
blocks of like maybe three, maybe five
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually about three hours worth of
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mash them all together and then I
release them on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you can go back and listen to
that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick now is that a lot of that old
stuff is being reposted and it's pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: the older old stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my solution to that, like I mentioned
earlier, is to put it up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find the show on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 103, maybe 105 episodes are
available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, click subscribe, click like,
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one more request.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love it if you'd go to iTunes and
give me a five-star review on iTunes and
[SPEAKER_01]: click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think about the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may read your review on a future episode
if you leave an iTunes rating and review.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, my throat is burning
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Johnny Snipes, and until next
[SPEAKER_01]: time, take a fat dab and give your mom a
hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember going to the city,
the apple, just the big apple.
