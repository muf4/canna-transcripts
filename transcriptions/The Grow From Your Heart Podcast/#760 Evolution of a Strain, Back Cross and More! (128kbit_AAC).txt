to the Irie Genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of updates and
feedback from great customer service
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel like that is most of the
rambling that I had written down here for
[SPEAKER_00]: the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about something that I've
got called evolution of a strain and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we will work our way into some grow
questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently in a chat and somebody
asked kind of how long it takes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I make a strain until it is released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, man didn't you make those
like a long time ago and why are you just
[SPEAKER_00]: now putting them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought that that would be a
great thing to talk about here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about the evolution
of a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make a new cross, when I get a male
plant and a female plant and I do some
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen chucking and those plants make
magic happen, how long from the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross is made until those seeds are
actually released to the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the process that takes,
the steps that takes, just the way we do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that I'm in a grow or maybe
somebody sends me a plant or I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: in my garden and I realize that female
plant right there would work beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: with that male plant over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something intuitively tells me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I'm smoking a plant and I go,
this is really good, but it's missing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go, oh, well this male plants
got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an inception.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spawned idea in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got to cut some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to clean out a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get space that there could be
at this time, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have just put a room into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 70 days before I could fucking
do this project or I could get it going
[SPEAKER_00]: right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the idea in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got to get the idea on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to breed plant A to plant B and my
goal is going to be to improve the part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant that sucks, kind of get this
straight from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will cut a bunch of clones,
the appropriate clones to breed this
[SPEAKER_00]: project about female A and male A and
we're going to cut those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to put them in the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course there will be some pollen
chuck and then six to eight weeks later
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have seeds and it takes about a week
for them to dry, pull the seeds out,
[SPEAKER_00]: separate them, get them all packaged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time I start cutting those clones
to the time I actually have usable,
[SPEAKER_00]: packageable seeds in my hands is probably
somewhere around 16 to 20-ish weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how large I want those plants
to get, depending on how much space I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got, depending on which strains I'm
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some veg much more quickly, some don't veg
as rapidly so they've got to go another
[SPEAKER_00]: week, but it could be up to 20 weeks from
the time I cut the clones till I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: first seeds in my hand ready to put into
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there there's a lot of work to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say I got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the male plant and the female plant
in the room at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did their magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the seeds harden up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds have been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants get harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants dry, pull the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 20 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the other steps that
it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the work really begins
before I can start releasing this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put 20 weeks into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got to harvest it, package it up,
and do some testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I start growing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 20 weeks already and I don't
even know what I've made yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna grow these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna veg them out for just a couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be really little on my first
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tester plants are tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They veg till they're about eight or nine
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take a lot of pictures and a lot of
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is to make the seeds we
already established.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about a 20 week process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm gonna grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna veg for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm gonna flower for 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already up to approximately a 30
week process and all I've done is test the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else has even grown these yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I grow them, if I approve,
then I package up testers and I go
[SPEAKER_00]: recruiting the test team to get some seeds
going for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're gonna take a week or two to
get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're gonna take two to four weeks
to veg those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys go even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at 40 weeks already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they've got nine to 10 more weeks of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 50 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we're at nearly a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two more weeks is a full year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is several weeks of work before we
even really get to put a seed out to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to send it out to the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's oftentimes when I see that the
testers are having success with these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, I will add them as freebies to
orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting seeds off of iRedirect,
then you will get some brand new shit as
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just putting them out as test
seeds, I also give them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're labeled on the package that
they're testers that I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make it clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a freebie tester, but here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What then happens after I give those
testers away, a lot of those people will
[SPEAKER_00]: grow those before they even grow the seeds
they paid for because they got some brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new exciting shit they weren't expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get even more feedback because now
I've got the feedback I got from the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get feedback from my testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get feedback from the people that
are growing it as freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group tests it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes out as freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm getting a bunch of photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a bunch of data and a bunch of
feedback, and we know what we've really
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, if it's gotten this far,
I know it's going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't get this far if it's not gonna
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't like it, if the testers didn't
approve of it, if there were problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just got scrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got put on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got forgotten about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are probably flushed down the
toilet or in a compost bin or fed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I see enough people growing it and
I've got pictures and photos and data,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I can start hyping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to come out for an
official release.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I may do at this point is do kind of
a pre-release on my website or another
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I will pick one vendor and
I will do an exclusive drop with that one
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it is seeds here now
because that's my preferred exclusive
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor, but sometimes I will rotate it
around to where vendor A is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these packs on this day and then vendor B
is gonna get these packs on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I don't overload one vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money gets spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business gets moved around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to support all of the vendors
because they do support me and they
[SPEAKER_00]: support you, the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we have gone from me
making seeds, me testing seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the test crew testing out seeds,
the freebies going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are going to a pre-draw drop at
one vendor or on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just put out a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what the excitement is like,
what the hype is like, get a count of how
[SPEAKER_00]: many sell and how quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that lets me prepare for the official
drop where I will call up all the vendors
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, hey, I got this many packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll claim their packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send it out to them and we will all
agree that at five o'clock on this day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are going on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all drop them on our websites all at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that process is over one full
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the seeds that you guys see me
putting out on the websites right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds that are dropping on iREDirect
were made a solid year, maybe 18 months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the Inspector Royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on the website, on the iREDirect
website right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make a huge debut at the DGC
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have plenty there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was made in a greenhouse
approximately a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put plants outdoors already in that
greenhouse again and I am just now
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what goes into testing and
ensuring that a seed is a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just make some seeds and throw
them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these seeds sitting around being
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being saved and preserved for up
to a year before you guys get to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want to make sure it is a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, I'll make a small batch of
these seeds and we'll test those and once
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize if it's a real big hit,
then I'll go back and make a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's really time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to bang it out on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the inception of a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, from the time I think about it
to the time you get your first batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds is up to a solid year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as a consumer, as a buyer,
as a customer, as a grower, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: excited that I'm spending a solid year
doing research and development on one
[SPEAKER_00]: package of seed so that you don't get
intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: DUD plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really put a lot of care into this is
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inception and evolution of a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's one more part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I will release a strain and this
was really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Fiscal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiscal wanted to buy some seeds off of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you've got that cross and I was
like, yeah, but I got a lot of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, sell it to me and I said,
I can't sell it until I've got a name for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was throwing out names every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get a list of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, that one did become fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I've got for the evolution of
a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into these emails that
I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great email right here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from my friend Pete Pan007
and it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, question maybe for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, a lot of people are going on
vacation right now and harvest time always
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to fall on one week you leave for
vacay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says the thing that I was
going to say right after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to plan better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you plan to the grow and the
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet your wife planned the vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how that shit goes, but you do need
to plan better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got a calendar and a schedule
and we got Alexa and Siri to tell us when
[SPEAKER_00]: we fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But planning is key right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says, my question is, would you
harvest when things are looking super
[SPEAKER_00]: close at about a week nine or would you
wait and cut them down when you get home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love your straightforward info you give to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Pete Pan007 on the gram and your
awesome discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go follow Pete Pan007 on the gram
and also join the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link in the show notes and
in the video description to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are traveling around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't left Colorado, but I've been to
every fricking border of Colorado in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past couple of weeks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been no complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great, but it's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the garden does almost suffer at
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll catch myself driving home
going, fuck, I hope the plants are OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the plants are OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are, but it's a little nerve
wracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go on vacation,
it will be less nerve wracking if you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants will do you better if you
wait until you get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut them until you get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in doubt, always just give them that
extra week, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them grow longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have better buds if you go
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have more bud, better bud,
more dense bud, more flavor, more potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cut them down after the vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go enjoy your trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go enjoy the time with the family or
whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get back, you've got
something really cool to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to cut it down right before
you leave anyway, because then it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hang there your whole trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get too crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to do some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't burp it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put it in jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait till I get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for watering while you're gone,
I would just soak them real hard right
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go unless you've got a buddy or
a grow helper, which I really I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: that most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear more stories about the grow helper
fucking up than helping all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just water them real hard before you
go, and then just let them ride it out
[SPEAKER_00]: until you come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you'll have some buds that are
already drying on the stick before you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little pre-harvest going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my advice is always let them go a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do them too early ever unless that
is absolutely what you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you learned your lesson,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant ahead next time so you're not on
vacation during the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question here comes from my buddy
Alabama Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Alabama Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope all is well, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, things are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business is booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relationships are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world hasn't exploded yet,
so I guess things are going quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, have you ever initiated
a backcross using pollen from the original
[SPEAKER_00]: male donor?
[SPEAKER_00]: The original male donor using pollen
initiated a backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I had the original male,
I probably wouldn't need to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I make a backcross generally is
because the male plant is not present,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to make seeds of a female
plant, something we would call a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, I wouldn't do that because I
don't have the original male pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main goal when I'm making a backcross
is to replicate a female clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about how I make a backcross
since we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do, let's just say we want to
make Golden Goat backcross seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want Golden Goat regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want the fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not available because there's no
male of the Golden Goat available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I took Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is a great strain, but it is
completely different than Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the opposite in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got big fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows kind of with a stretchier
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little shorter and squatty,
but stretchy at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cush, you know what I mean,
but it is totally different than the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat's got the big skinny sativa
leaves, really tight internode spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal here, I took a male Daybreaker
plant and I pollinated a female Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I found the plants that came from
there, my goal was to replicate Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that looked like Daybreaker in
that progeny got immediately eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that looked like Daybreaker got
cold from the population right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only needed plants that looked like
Golden Goat, and I only needed a boy that
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like Golden Goat, so females got
pulled right away, and plants that looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like Daybreaker got pulled right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I narrowed it down to a male
plant that looked just like the Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the same leaf serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reacted the same way to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked just like the original female
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked so close to the original Golden
Goat that when I took leaves off and held
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to the other leaves, they matched
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the same serrations, same ripple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a perfect match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the pollen from my Golden Goat
to Daybreaker cross, and it's a male that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks just like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that pollen and put it onto the
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my goal here is to wash out the traits
from that Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got Golden Goat in here twice,
Daybreaker in here once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mathematically, genetically, this should
be mostly Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I saw it in my prediction,
I thought that I picked such a close
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat that probably 80 to 90% of the
phenotypes should look just like Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we ran a bunch of the seeds,
you guys have ran a bunch of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say 75% of them look just
like the original Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next step would be to backcross it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, what I would do is I
would take the original Golden Goat clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a female, and I would find some
of those backcross, the first filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of the backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a backcross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a male out of there that
looked just like Golden Goat again and put
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen back on the original Golden
Goat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, making a backcross number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the seeds that come out of there
should, in theory, if my selection was
[SPEAKER_00]: done correctly, those should be
approximately 80% Golden Goat dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, maybe 82, 84%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method here is to keep finding Golden
Goat looking males and putting that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: back onto the original Golden Goat to
solidify that Golden Goat trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in an essence, wash out all of the
traits of the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the Daybreaker in there,
I only used it for that pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: for that one inception, for that one round
to create some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my whole goal is to wash that out,
so I don't think I would use the original
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen unless my goal is to lock in
that male trait, but that doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary because I'm working with a
female clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's hypothetically say that a friend
of mine got a seed of a plant that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been wanting forever, but it turned out to
be a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, in theory, take that male plant,
pollen a female, create seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: find a female that looks like the male
that I want, use that original male to put
[SPEAKER_00]: on another female and keep going,
but I don't know what I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't have the original female,
so it's kind of a wild goose chase there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what my goal is
unless I can identify the female that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know what it grows like,
what it looks like, what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases, no, I would not initiate
a backcross using pollen from the original
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had the original male, then I
wouldn't need the backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole goal is to wash out the pollen
from that original male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that answers the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered the question there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that did spark any more questions,
please do follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address, of course, is
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a big stack of emails here right
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not say if they want their name
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I'm asking about
that 10 days in flowering on the light
[SPEAKER_00]: change to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me recap a little bit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For about the past year, I've been talking
about a method where I turn my lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 hours on and six hours off for the last
10 to 14 days of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people think that flushing is a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do or don't flush, when you start
flushing, just turn those lights back on
[SPEAKER_00]: to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, your buds will get
beefier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may even finish up a few days early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra light really makes the plants
go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it does a lot of great
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend here is trying the 18.6
method and they do ask how much PPFD
[SPEAKER_00]: should I run?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently at about a thousand with
13.11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great switch from 13.11 to
18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a great cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would not recommend changing the
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I do is change the amount of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing the PPFD will be too many
variables in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just change the amount of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get more light
without stressing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you change it to more light,
you may burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you change it to less light,
it's kind of pointless to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with the exact same amount of light,
the same number of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I do is increase the amount of hours
which the plants are given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else also asked me if I do a ramp
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do like going from 12.12,
do I do 13 hours one day and then 14 the
[SPEAKER_00]: next?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go straight from 12.12 to 18 on and 6
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll even do 19 and 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new thing I'm fucking with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do seem to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more question for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from another person who
would like to remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what is the reason some plants
lose their aroma at the end of flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that could be
causing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a VP D issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a light intensity issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your lights too close and too hot to
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that breaks down
terpenes is heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got too much heat in the
room, the terps are getting destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would do is check on
the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the VP D.
[SPEAKER_00]: How hot is it in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get it a little bit cooler toward
the end of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold temperatures later in the grow will
give you better flavors, aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also will bring out some really cool
colors and may really help with the
[SPEAKER_00]: density of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be a feed issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a VP D issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a lighting issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also could be a genetics issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not cutting down on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you letting them go too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they simply going into senescence and
just giving up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not feeding them long enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you feeding them too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you feeding anything to enhance the
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you giving it anything to make it
smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several things that I would
check on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check on, like I've already said,
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my number one culprit for killing
terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would check on light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far from the canopy is your light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just roasting your terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to tell by looking at
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have plenty of airflow in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would make sure that you're feeding
something to encourage healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of details,
but those are things that I do think could
[SPEAKER_00]: make plants lose their smell at the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pamps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
