calm, you know, I like to start the show
[SPEAKER_01]: off by talking about what I'm smoking
today I've been taking dabs of bananas
[SPEAKER_01]: foster live batter from green dot labs
This is a blend of banana og and Paris
[SPEAKER_01]: Larry on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor is described as banana sugar
and oatmeal I think I agree with those
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked about the banana fosters on
the show before I really enjoy the banana
[SPEAKER_01]: turps I think I forgot how much I enjoy
banana turps not only do I enjoy The
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor of a banana strain, but the buzz
that comes with it is really desirable in
[SPEAKER_01]: my opinion So I'm really digging the
bananas foster live batter on the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: the package It says it contains sixty
seven point five seven percent THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: non-detectable amounts of CBD Big shout
out to our friends at green dot labs for
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect bananas foster live batter All
right in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cover a maintenance checklist
this episode will come out on the 31st
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow We'll be the first that is a good
time to do a bunch of grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance before we get to the main part

to do is visit www.patreon.com forward
[SPEAKER_01]: slash grow from your heart All of the
information you need will be right there
[SPEAKER_01]: on the screen And of course, I did include
a link in the show notes to make it nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and easy I think that covers most of the
business part of this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into this grow room maintenance
checklist We spend a lot of money on gear
[SPEAKER_01]: in the grow We rely on all of that
equipment to work properly But it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna run on its own without a little bit
of a checkup without some maintenance
[SPEAKER_01]: without some routine maintenance So once
in a while we need to think about the
[SPEAKER_01]: moving parts in the grow and maybe take
care of them update them a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: need maintenance many things may need
replaced especially if you haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing maintenance So what are some of the
things in the grow room that we really
[SPEAKER_01]: need to maintain?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started thinking about this list Just by
going through my day in the grow in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head and thinking what are the tools and
equipment that I touch and that I pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to One of the first things that
came to my mind was my ph meter I use my
[SPEAKER_01]: ph meter on a daily basis I've got
multiple ph meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a blue lab combo meter that's
stuck to the wall the probes dangle into a
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir I can always see the ph the EC
and the PPMs and the temperature in that
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that device However, sometimes I
second guess my equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I know that that one device is
reliable?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a second ph pin to double
check my first ph pin I use the ph testing
[SPEAKER_01]: solution I make sure that they all test
right then I double check with two pins
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally I just want to Double-check
because ph is very important, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: to a cocoa grower somebody run in a hydro
system Your ph is going to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: important So let's clean and calibrate our
ph meters on a regular basis as a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: your ph meter if you're a salt-based
grower if you're a cocoa a hydro type
[SPEAKER_01]: grower your ph meter is like your Hammer
or your saw if you were a carpenter that
[SPEAKER_01]: is something you bust out every day on a
daily basis You need your hammer and your
[SPEAKER_01]: saw to work reliably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get a good quality Ph pin a good
quality ec meter all the good quality
[SPEAKER_01]: meters that you can get we don't want
trash here We don't want junk here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said in a previous episode I
believe you get what you pay for when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to ph meters and ec meters and
testing devices So pay for those get
[SPEAKER_01]: quality devices then let's maintain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's clean them We need to clean the
probes they come with the cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have it order a little bit of
cleaning solution It's not expensive clean
[SPEAKER_01]: your probes Recalibrate your ph meters if
you haven't been doing it On at least a
[SPEAKER_01]: monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend weekly every Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start the Monday off just by
calibrating your meters It doesn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: that much time and it feels really good to
know that your gear is in top shape So
[SPEAKER_01]: clean and calibrate your meters your ph
pin your ec pin your ppm pin Whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got clean and calibrate those bad
bitches now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is something that you may not know
I'm not sure that I knew this when you
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire a new ph pen You are supposed to
soak that pen in the storage solution the
[SPEAKER_01]: kci Storage solution for 24 hours before
you activate that new ph pen I've seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people get a new pen pull it out of
the box dip it in calibration solution
[SPEAKER_01]: start mixing solution and use that as
their calibration tool That's not the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to take these pins out of the box
Fill a most of them come with a little cup
[SPEAKER_01]: fill that little cup with your kci storage
solution Set the probe in there for 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours Then after 24 hours use your four
and seven and possibly some companies use
[SPEAKER_01]: other calibration Standards, but use your
four and your seven and calibrate your
[SPEAKER_01]: device that way and then rinse it off Then
now you are ready to ph your solution You
[SPEAKER_01]: can put it in your nutrient solution and
it will show you an accurate reading But
[SPEAKER_01]: those things don't come out of the box
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need some prep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need some love We need to soak it
then we need to calibrate it So don't
[SPEAKER_01]: forget those steps take good care of your
equipment and it will continue to take
[SPEAKER_01]: good care of you Another thing keep that
probe on your ph pen moist if that probe
[SPEAKER_01]: dries it dies the grower cries keep that
fucker wet because once it goes dry you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to buy a new one and they are not
cheap good quality ph pens are expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way to remember to always keep
your ph pen moist is to forget to moisten
[SPEAKER_01]: one you spend 130 bucks it dries up it
dies grower cries You got to spend another
[SPEAKER_01]: 130 bucks at the grow store blue lab is
happy with you the guy at the grow store
[SPEAKER_01]: is excited But you're at 130 bucks because
you let that fucker dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep moving another thing
that I think about we need to maintain is
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning all of the filters what kind of
filtration do you have in your grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have an air conditioner I have got
a 14,000 BTU rolling air conditioner with
[SPEAKER_01]: the filter in the back of it that thing
needs cleaned about every two weeks it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets sticky it gets dusty in there it's
got a filter in it pop that filter out
[SPEAKER_01]: take it to where there's a sink and just
hose it down then let it dry then put it
[SPEAKER_01]: back clean out that filter that will
increase airflow that will decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: restriction air restriction on your air
conditioner which makes the air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioner work harder which makes it
last less time if we maintain these
[SPEAKER_01]: devices they will last longer for us we
need this gear to last money is expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not making a lot of money on growing
cannabis these days because everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis every dollar and every
gram counts so maintain the gear we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: with the time we've got and make this gear
stick around so clean the filters in your
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioner clean the filters in your
humidifier and dehumidifier those should
[SPEAKER_01]: be done probably every three to five maybe
seven days but if you haven't done it get
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and do it and add that shit to
your task list put that on your general
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance list clean the filters on the
humidifier and dehumidifier check them
[SPEAKER_01]: they're probably gunky if you haven't
cleaned them in a while they're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: gross other things to check out the RO
filter if you're running reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you got a big boy filter or a small
boy filter are those filters in there are
[SPEAKER_01]: they any good is your membrane any good in
your filtration are you just running water
[SPEAKER_01]: through a device and wasting time and not
really cleaning it and thinking you're
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning it are those is it time to change
those filters is that do also irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: filters in a commercial environment I run
a big reservoir with a pump that goes up a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of PVC tubing in one point of that
PVC tubing there's a straight line going
[SPEAKER_01]: up and a filter that hangs down at a 45
degree angle going down the idea is that
[SPEAKER_01]: the heavy sediments will fall into that
filter and the water will keep moving so
[SPEAKER_01]: that by the time my water gets to the end
of the line it doesn't clog up my emitters
[SPEAKER_01]: with chunky nutrient dust those filters
need to be cleaned often depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: we feed if we mix up certain nutrients we
have to clean that fucking filter while
[SPEAKER_01]: we're feeding but most of the time it's a
once every couple of days once a week sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing if you haven't cleaned that
filter now is the time get in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: clean that shit it's the first of the
month it's monday let's get in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: clean shit up monday is the second but
this comes out on the 31st so you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: day to prepare and get your shit together
so clean all of your stuff all your stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: clean all your stuff you guys clean all of
the things that have filters in there
[SPEAKER_01]: clean out your reservoirs do you have a
reservoir where you've got 50 gallons of
[SPEAKER_01]: water 200 gallons of water just 10 gallons
dump that fucker out and give it a good
[SPEAKER_01]: scrub and let it dry if you use any sort
of a cleaner make sure that you rinse out
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that cleaner no matter what it is
if it's faizan if it's simple green if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bleach make sure you remove all of
that cleaner from your reservoir clean it
[SPEAKER_01]: out let it dry rinse it out again then you
can reuse it but clean that res we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need shit building up on the reservoir
also another thing you need to clean is
[SPEAKER_01]: the pump many of us are using many
different styles of pumps we've got hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: pumps we've got mixed pumps lots of pumps
going on many of those pumps have little
[SPEAKER_01]: filters in them many of those pumps have
little moving parts take it apart get a
[SPEAKER_01]: toothbrush clean that shit out i know it
sounds tedious but do you want your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room to be a Ferrari or do you want it to
be a 92 prelude you've got the opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the grow room the Ferrari if you
take care of it it will never run like a
[SPEAKER_01]: Ferrari if you put fucking prelude care
and love into it if you got one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: preludes it's just balling out there no
disrespect but you know what i'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about that dude with the primer gray
prelude that's fucking falling apart he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't take care of it it's falling apart
now if you got that Ferrari every day
[SPEAKER_01]: you're tinkering on that Ferrari making
sure that every corner is polished and
[SPEAKER_01]: buffed the rims look shiny the
undercarriage is clean you're making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that Ferrari is well maintained there's
oil level is perfect brake fluid is
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect muffler fluid is perfect you got
it all going just the way you need it
[SPEAKER_01]: let's make our grow rooms fucking
Ferrari's then we can win the race another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing i see people forgetting to clean
especially in a commercial environment is
[SPEAKER_01]: the measuring cups which we measure our
nutrients i don't know what size of a
[SPEAKER_01]: grill you're working with you may have a
shot glass you measure 20 milliliters you
[SPEAKER_01]: may have a like a small pitcher you
measure 100 milliliters whatever device
[SPEAKER_01]: you are pouring your nutrient solution
from the bottle into this measuring cup
[SPEAKER_01]: let's clean the measuring cup why not it's
probably got some nutrient stains on it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got different colors on it are those
salts mixing in to the other nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: you're pouring in there did bottle a just
mix in with bottle b and then bottle c
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed with a and b what are you doing to
your nutrient solution let's clean those
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing cups it's really not that hard
while we're cleaning those mixing cups
[SPEAKER_01]: let's also calibrate the scale which we
may use to measure dry powdered nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're using veg bloom you weigh those
nutrients out by the gram they're powdered
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need to you don't do milliliters
or whatever you put it on a scale and you
[SPEAKER_01]: do two five grams if it's the base you're
doing five grams per gallon if it's shine
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably doing two it's plus life
you're probably doing one gram per gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a scale let's clean the scale
off i see those scales covered in
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and it's gross let's just clean
that fucker up get a paper towel get some
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner and just clean that bad bitch up
get a rag if you're not a paper towel kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of guy i get it someone's going to give me
feedback i mean i noticed as soon as i
[SPEAKER_01]: said that but let's clean up that scale
let's also calibrate the scale we've
[SPEAKER_01]: calibrated our ph pens we've calibrated
everything else let's calibrate the scale
[SPEAKER_01]: it's real easy most of the scales come
with the calibration weight keep that
[SPEAKER_01]: handy have that next to your msds sheet or
something to where you can just grab it
[SPEAKER_01]: measure make sure it weighs right make
sure it's accurate go back to work measure
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrients we're measuring five grams
per gallon if you got 20 gallons that's
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 grams if you're just a little bit off
you can end up with 110 grams and that
[SPEAKER_01]: could actually have seriously adverse
effects on the plants or you could give
[SPEAKER_01]: them 90 grams and the plants are going to
be starving so make sure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: calibrate and clean up the scale if you
are using a scale for dry nutrients we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to move on a little bit to things
that i see in the grow the actual grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space a lot of grows have lights these are
old school but a lot of people are still
[SPEAKER_01]: doing them some of the breeders still use
these you've got a light with a vented
[SPEAKER_01]: hood with glass between the bulb and the
canopy of your plant so you got basically
[SPEAKER_01]: a big metal shoe box with glass on the
bottom so that the bulb is inside there
[SPEAKER_01]: and it shines down through the glass and
then you put ducting on both ends and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can run air over it that way the heat from
your bulb doesn't go down to your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: it just gets blown right away by the
ducting it stays inside there because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the glass that glass gets really dirty
let's clean that glass by so much percent
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm going to say that glass probably cuts
down your light by five to fifteen percent
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a guess i'm really not a scientist
when it comes to light but then for every
[SPEAKER_01]: little speckle of pesticide spray or
foliar spray or every bug on there you're
[SPEAKER_01]: losing two three five more percent and
you're paying for it you're still plugging
[SPEAKER_01]: that light in it's still cranking out
electricity it's still pumping out light
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you're not getting as much light
over the canopy as you thought let's keep
[SPEAKER_01]: moving i've got a lot to try to cover
that's why i'm talking kind of fast here
[SPEAKER_01]: um check all of the moving parts i don't
know what else you've got in your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that makes noise that words that
moves around the fans are the fans
[SPEAKER_01]: clicking is one of them wobbling do they
oscillate properly check all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: do a safety check is there something for
your dreads to get caught up on is there
[SPEAKER_01]: some corner for you to get snagged on is
there a sharp spot on a table is there a
[SPEAKER_01]: stick for you to poke your eye on do that
kind of maintenance and just set yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: up for success so you don't have to slow
down in the future when you got your hands
[SPEAKER_01]: full and you're in a rush take the time
now to put some duct tape on that sharp
[SPEAKER_01]: corner maybe clean up that stuff you're
going to trip on that's more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanliness episode but check out all the
moving parts we've got air conditioners
[SPEAKER_01]: humidifiers dehumidifiers we've got a ton
of stuff to check on anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: moving that's got parts check on it listen
to it sometimes i can hear the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier making the wrong noise it's
way up there and i can hear it the rhythm
[SPEAKER_01]: should be but sometimes it went that means
something went wrong we need to check on
[SPEAKER_01]: it pay attention to that kind of shit um
check outside for light leaks if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing at home just walk around walk
around the house walk around the building
[SPEAKER_01]: look for light leaks do you see any signs
that there is a grow inside the building
[SPEAKER_01]: is there light reflecting through your
ducting is there light reflecting through
[SPEAKER_01]: some weird spot you didn't think of can
you see the light at all can you hear any
[SPEAKER_01]: of your equipment outside that would tell
thieves snitches or cops that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: something going on that's part of the
maintenance routine walk around the
[SPEAKER_01]: building walk outside and check for light
leaks um is your carbon filter working
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another important thing to think
about is your odor control actually
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling odor sometimes i can walk into
a commercial cultivation facility and i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even smell herb i'm around cannabis
so much my nose is blank to it that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like smelling normal air to me so i don't
smell ganja i have driven away from my
[SPEAKER_01]: house before and i've come home and went
oh fuck i need a new carbon filter so make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure your carbon filter is working you may
need to leave for a full day go away for
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire day because your nose is fucked
up you smell your skunk weed you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even notice it go away for the day come
back and when you walk in the house really
[SPEAKER_01]: pay attention do i smell my own ganja if
you smell it other people can smell it
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're accustomed to it and if you
can smell it it's out of control you need
[SPEAKER_01]: a new carbon filter i think many companies
say they last two years depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: moist the room is how much air you've been
blowing through it how well you took care
[SPEAKER_01]: of it how i don't know did you jostle it
around when you moved it there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing factors a good one should
last about 18 months a crappy one will
[SPEAKER_01]: last you maybe a year if they're really
good maybe two years i only trust mine for
[SPEAKER_01]: about 18 months because i don't need that
stink going out of the house so check on
[SPEAKER_01]: your carbon filter excuse me for clearing
the throat here check on all of the moving
[SPEAKER_01]: parts check on all your gear then let's
move into uh part of a maintenance routine
[SPEAKER_01]: is also ordering supplies what else are we
going to need this month it's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to order everything in one shot and
get one delivery or if you're going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: store it's so much easier to go there i
order for a commercial warehouse i can't
[SPEAKER_01]: go pick it up in the car we get trucks
delivered so my mindset's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different but do one order every month if
you can that way you don't have to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow store too many times to be seen
there too much every time you're there
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to make an impulse buy and
buy some dumb you didn't need also every
[SPEAKER_01]: time you're there you're exposing yourself
to other people who grow who probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites or pollen or powdery mildew
or something on them also you're exposing
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself to a sales guy who's going to
sell you some shit you don't need and
[SPEAKER_01]: change your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy and also you're going to find
other growers
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to go to the store
and buy all of those bottles in one shot i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to go back makes it very easy
for me and the grow store loves it because
[SPEAKER_01]: i don't have to go bother them again so
think about all of the nutrients you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to need have a strategy go to the
grow store get all those nutrients in one
[SPEAKER_01]: shot also get all of your pesticides and
fungicides in one shot think
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you're going to get you should
already have a strategy what the fuck to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for i can eradicate bugs quite
quickly also i keep one fungicide on deck
[SPEAKER_01]: at all times as well if i see a powdery
mildew situation or something i've already
[SPEAKER_01]: got the products here to get rid of it so
be prepared also gloves and personal
[SPEAKER_01]: protective equipment buying gloves here
and there gets expensive if you can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: enough gloves to last you the month that
is much more cost effective and again if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting it online less amazon
shipments if you're going to the store
[SPEAKER_01]: less visits to the store get your gloves
your personal protective equipment if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're spraying you need a tyvek suit if
you need respirator cartridges those are
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to get right now honestly the
respirator cartridges are on backorder
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere so respirator cartridges
hopefully you got a couple of those
[SPEAKER_01]: stocked up for your grow but get all the
personal protective equipment another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing we should think about is how long
have those bulbs been in that grow room if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're running conventional bulbs like hps
or metal halide bulbs they don't last
[SPEAKER_01]: forever it is time to change them i always
write down when i put new bulbs in a room
[SPEAKER_01]: i've got a spot where i keep documentation
for the grow so i'll put in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grow here's how i do it i will write on a
piece of duct tape new bulbs on january
[SPEAKER_01]: 1st and i put that piece of duct tape on
the door to the grow room it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious these bulbs january 1st so in the
determined amount of time my determined
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time and the owner and investors
determined amount of time for changing
[SPEAKER_01]: bulbs are always different they don't want
to buy bulbs until it's fucking dark in
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow they don't realize that those
bulbs are still sucking up 100% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity but not putting out 100% of
the light because the bulbs are dying so
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't fucking want to buy new bulbs
until the harvest comes and they realize
[SPEAKER_01]: why didn't we pull as much as we did last
time and he say the bulbs are shot we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting as much light as we did and
they go oh really it would have made that
[SPEAKER_01]: much difference we'll buy bulbs now and he
had to show them the hard way so how long
[SPEAKER_01]: have your bulbs been in your grow is it
time to swap those out did you use a par
[SPEAKER_01]: meter did you do anything to document how
much light you're getting and how much
[SPEAKER_01]: light you're getting now did you write
down the date that those bulbs were put in
[SPEAKER_01]: there maybe it's time to get new bulbs
mark down the day and start fresh with a
[SPEAKER_01]: good idea because like i said when you
plug in that ballast that electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: happens it gets generated it gets moved
down the cable it gets put into your
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking socket it tries to come out of the
light it's still giving it a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: watts if your bulbs only going i'm burned
out i'm going to put out like 700 watts
[SPEAKER_01]: you're ripping yourself off for 30 you're
still paying for it the electric company
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't go oh your harvest was light we'll
give you a break they don't give half of a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit so make sure your light bulbs are in
good condition if you're using leds those
[SPEAKER_01]: should last for quite a while but they
will degrade over time you have a much
[SPEAKER_01]: longer lifespan on your leds what else are
we going to talk about mop heads and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that order cleaning supplies many of
you overlook how important cleanliness is
[SPEAKER_01]: in your grow room and you just kind of
half ass that let's stop that shit it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the first of the month let's get in there
and clean all that shit up and start off
[SPEAKER_01]: with a fresh clean month you may need new
mop heads i am certain that you need trash
[SPEAKER_01]: bags maybe you need another dedicated
trash can for the grow area that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just set right there and not have to go
chasing down a trash bag all the time have
[SPEAKER_01]: a trash can prepared to go also do you
need to order more rags or paper towels or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you use to clean stuff also do
you have a bunch of newspapers on hand so
[SPEAKER_01]: when you spill something you can just go
grab a stack old newspaper and stack those
[SPEAKER_01]: newspapers on the wetness and it'll suck
it all up for you that is a grow trick
[SPEAKER_01]: from way back in the day keep all the old
newspapers in a pile if you spill some
[SPEAKER_01]: liquids drop the newspaper on there
newspaper will clean it right up it was
[SPEAKER_01]: free throw it away not a big deal another
thing you may need to stock up on if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can find it i highly recommend that you
get some isopropyl alcohol i like to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: my shit with 91 iso it's hard as shit to
find right now during these weird pandemic
[SPEAKER_01]: times isopropyl alcohol will hit the shelf
and it is frenzied over and it is a melee
[SPEAKER_01]: people put in the carts and it's gone i
usually grab about six bottles try to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them stacked up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the fridge if you can get some
isopropyl alcohol for
[SPEAKER_01]: isopropyl alcohol you don't want to be
cutting clones and realize oh i don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any clone gel you've got all these clones
cut you got your dome set up and no
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking clone gel make sure you've got all
of the stuff you're going to need set
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself up for success then once you've
got all your nutrients and things that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're going to need pesticides and
things like that then we will move into
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning supplies make sure you've got all
the shelves stocked make sure you're well
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go and prepared also part of the
monthly maintenance checklist i almost
[SPEAKER_01]: forgot does the fire extinguisher have a
charge your fire extinguisher has got a
[SPEAKER_01]: little gauge the fire extinguisher may be
a rasta because it's got a red a yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: and a green chart on it and you want to be
obviously in that green that's when the
[SPEAKER_01]: fire extinguisher is the best when it gets
to the yellow it is time to get that fire
[SPEAKER_01]: extinguisher either replaced or recharged
depending on the size quality and brand of
[SPEAKER_01]: your fire extinguisher many of them once
they get to that point they're done
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got to be disposed of properly
some of them if they're the correct kind
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take it to the fire department and
they will actually recharge that for you
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure that you've got a safe fire
extinguisher also while we're on this
[SPEAKER_01]: subject check all the batteries in your
smoke detectors and your carbon monoxide
[SPEAKER_01]: detectors if you're running co2 in your
grow space that carbon monoxide detector
[SPEAKER_01]: be a totally different story but if you
are if you've got smoke detectors go test
[SPEAKER_01]: them out make sure that they work we don't
want to just have them as props we want
[SPEAKER_01]: those to work all right i think that wraps
up my grow room maintenance episode i
[SPEAKER_01]: think the other thing i could say is just
stand by the door occasionally and just
[SPEAKER_01]: look i notice a lot of details that i
didn't think about but i'm just looking
[SPEAKER_01]: i've just got this look into the grow just
looking just glassing just staring at the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants i don't know what i'm looking for
but i'll find something i always find one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that the grower the grotex would be
like what are you staring at boss i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know yet but it'll tell me and then a
couple couple minutes into my weird stare
[SPEAKER_01]: i go that that's the problem we got to fix
you guys i need a guy to come help me
[SPEAKER_01]: solve this problem and then we get a
grotech on it and i go help them figure it
[SPEAKER_01]: out we solve the issue i notice a lot of
problems just doing the growers gaze
[SPEAKER_01]: notice a lot of issues that way able to
solve them that's a lot of passion and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of dedication of the plants all right
