[SPEAKER_00]: And I did include a link in the show notes
and in the video description to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really thank you guys for all of the
continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this podcast episode does come
from Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Patreon member did ask to remain
anonymous so this doesn't come from
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody with a specific name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, you only consume
dabs and I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does dabbing require, oh and it says,
and I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes more sense that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, does dabbing require less cleanup
and is dabbing more expensive than smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do notice on the show, most of the
live shows I'm on, most of the video feeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm on, I do talk about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk much about smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do prefer to smoke mostly dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like to catch the buzz that I need
from smoking flour, I would have to just
[SPEAKER_00]: be smoking from the bong all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not super healthy for my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be consuming a bunch of
chlorophyll and green leafy matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get everything I need in a big fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take about a dab every hour,
maybe every two hours, depends on what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in an ideal world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I'm hanging out doing work
around here, if I'm somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you don't get to do dabs every hour,
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's every four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an ideal world, I would just have
to take a dab every hour, maybe every two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: As to where if I were smoking flowers,
I would smoke until my throat was harsh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my voice was dry, my lungs were coughing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I find that smoking flour makes my
eyes much more red than smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a podcaster, being somebody who
works with other people, teaching people
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of in a boss situation most of the
time, I can't be real scratchy voiced,
[SPEAKER_00]: real coffee lunged all the time,
real red eyed, and I can't be going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: car to take a bong rip every fucking 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a break about every two hours in
a real work environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pull a big fat dab about every two
hours, allegedly, I don't know if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working for you, maybe I'm not smoking
dabs, wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you will notice that I do prefer to
smoke concentrates over the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I have been smoking a lot of
flowers lately, I've got some great blue
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry truffle flowers that were grown
by a friend, I got some good Nepali girl
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, ran into some good double dose
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm stocked up on good flowers right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rolling king size joints,
joints the size of my middle finger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and during the Super Bowl, I didn't watch
the game, I watched the Tom, Tom Segura,
[SPEAKER_00]: Burt Kreischer was the companion to the
Super Bowl, I watched that instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: watching the Super Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that day, I smoked a big old giant
joint during the Super Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I digress, I'm rambling,
you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke a lot of flour on camera on
video, but I do smoke some flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch the video with Mike and I
that I recently put up, I smoked a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of bowls during that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do smoke flour, but the main part of
the question is dabbing less cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, I guess everything is sticky is
the bottom line when it comes to dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a jar of concentrates,
you stick a little tool into that jar of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that tool is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that into the banger, you put a
carb cap on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a sticky dabber and a
sticky banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to set those down somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put them down, that surface
becomes sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, my elbows and my hoodie
sleeves are sticky because the table and
[SPEAKER_00]: desk around me are perpetually fucking
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that it's cleaner and less
cleanup than smoking flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no ashtray, which I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to scrape out a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to scrape my bong,
scrape my pipe, clean my pipe as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing doesn't make that black funky
residue, the tarry like shit, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is fucking sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a slick mat to put down on the
table so that after you take a dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could put your tools on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you got to clean that up with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were dabbing what I used to call
insert dabs or a bucket dabs, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker banger and you heat that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your dab inside of another bucket
that looks like a thimble and you drop
[SPEAKER_00]: that inside of that banger so that you
don't roast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a double boiler is sort of the
idea there, but that way requires a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother setup of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a thing of alcohol and you got to
clean it immediately or it just gets too
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know about cleaner or less
cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying everything is fucking
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a point in time when I wanted to
name the studio Sticky Knob Studios.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds a little bit obscene,
which is right up my alley, but the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: was that everything was fucking sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my knobs, my computer gear,
the table, Sticky Table Studios was an
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went with GFYH Studio, Girl From
Your Heart Studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works out quite well, but everything is
sticky when you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it says, is dabbing more expensive
than smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also another thing that I was going to
say, the rig water isn't so bad compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to bong water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep your rig water fairly clean,
it's not nearly as bad as bong water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you spill it, a bunch of funky shit's
not going to come spilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig water, the water inside of your
rig, if your rig is just dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking dabs, the water that pours out,
if you don't get big chunks of reclaim and
[SPEAKER_00]: oil just pouring out when you spill it,
it won't smell as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may actually smell kind of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I clean my rig,
I dump out the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like whatever the last few dabs
I took were, and sometimes it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rig water is not as bad as bong water
if you keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking flowers and dabs through
the same piece, that water is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: smell terrible, and you are a fucking
savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you would get two separate
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can enjoy the flavor and
turps of those dabs and enjoy the essence
[SPEAKER_00]: of that flower through two different
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a totally different podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is dabbing more expensive than smoking
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial setup to smoke dabs could be,
can be, a little bit expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some hurdles there to getting
into smoking flower, to smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke flower, you get a bag of
weed, or now it's a medicine jar filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with weed, and you need a pipe or some
rolling papers and a lighter, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get into the accessories,
something to scrape it out, an ashtray,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you get a bong, something fancy to
carry your pipe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't go too far from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too much fancy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to taking dabs, there is a
lot of equipment involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a rig, first of all, and a
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your first combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The banger is what the dab goes into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You neither need a banger, a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called a turp slurper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a honey bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all kinds of different variable
nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the piece that the dab actually goes
onto, the piece that gets heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need a rig to put that onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part that you smoke through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the water, then it goes up
to your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass piece you smoke through,
that is your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a nail, a banger, a bucket,
a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you probably need a carb cap to cap
that banger, your bucket, your turp
[SPEAKER_00]: slurper, whatever you chose to go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like a normal club banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're probably going to need a torch
to heat that banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're looking at anywhere from 100 to
thousands, thousands of dollars for a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a rig, a banger, a torch,
a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to stick in the
concentrates and transfer the dab from the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate to the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need other things
that you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need Q-tips?
[SPEAKER_00]: After you take a dab, that fucking banger
is going to be filthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and wipe it out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're super cool, you need
something fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just throw the Q-tips on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something fancy to throw the
Q-tips in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a little fancy trash can for your
Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also you need a Q-tip holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't just come out of the fucking
plastic container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need matching glass Q-tip holders and
Q-tip trash cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something if you're super cool,
if you're a heady boy, if you're hyped up,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going out in public and people
are going to see you, that's the shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need that slick mat that I talked
about a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to set all your sticky shit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a lot of people like to buy some sort
of a mood mat, a dab pad, something thick,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a mouse pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically repurposed mouse pads
made out of that thin rubbery type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mouse pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them cut into all kinds of
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every brand out there has got their logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you'll see the Rasta Jeff dab
mat, the rig mat, the rig pad,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mood mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to set your rig on so that you
don't have to set your expensive thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar rig back down on the hardwood
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you take a dab, you got that
soft little surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear tink, tink every time you
set your rig down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get into dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you're over the entry hurdles,
then it's not expensive per se to take
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no more expensive than smoking flour
once you're into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you can get yourself a cheap
rig for probably 75 to 100 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little bit cheaper depending on
where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they go all the way up to
thousands and thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rigs that I drool over that are
in the five and $10,000 price range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on where you go, where you are,
who you know, what store you shop at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably about 30 to 50 bucks for a good
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them for 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what you want to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entry level 30, 40 high quality shit,
three, five, maybe a thousand dollars for
[SPEAKER_00]: a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: A torch anywhere from 50 to a hundred
bucks for a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to spend 80 to a hundred
dollars on a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy a lot of different devices for
a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take bigger dabs in most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use, I use a bigger dabber than most
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a happy daddy dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called the glob father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at happy daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're doing things
anymore, but shout out, shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're not going to go too far into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A carb cap can be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a clear one for like 20 bucks
or you can get a fancy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep saying three, five,
maybe seven or 900, maybe a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a mothership carb cap,
they could be 2,500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even called carb caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got their own special name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things can be cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can get really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab mat can be anywhere from 30 to a
hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy normal Q-tips to clean your dab
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to melt in the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to clean it, if that oil
is still hot, get glob mobs, glob mops,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's kind of aimed for the
dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit thicker, a little
more industrial strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're honestly made for the
cosmetic industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my alley, but get the better
Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that Q-tip holder, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get a fancy, heavy Q-tip
holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's talk about the prices of dabs
versus flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got all that gear,
the prices aren't too far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying like an eighth of flour versus,
I don't know where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what shit costs where you
are, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here right now in Colorado, you can get an
ounce of weed for anywhere between 90 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 240 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality will vary based on your price,
just like you should expect the $90 ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a $90 ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 240 looks like a $240 ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you would expect here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grams, depending on who you are,
where you are, one gram of, this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrative choice today, the garlic
banger number nine from Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't advertise with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay cash for this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am friends at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually the first person to buy
recreational cannabis in this county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from this dispensary, the same
ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of a VIP friends and
family discount that does help me out not
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a little bit of a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 10%, which goes a far away when
you're buying 300 bucks worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't advertise with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love garlic turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good brand quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are $40 or $45 without any
discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an ounce for about around 240
if you want to get that top shelf shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to get some stuff that you
don't want to show it off on Instagram or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like 80, 90, maybe a
hundred bucks, a gram of top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate, 45 bucks maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can find it for 35, somewhere
between 35 and 50 out the doors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you should expect for a top shelf
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know about the price difference
because I would smoke a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to be blowing a bong hit in
each ear while I take a bong hit through
[SPEAKER_00]: my face and maybe do bong hits through
other orify at the same time to get me
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly as high as I can get off of one dab
of this garlic banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid cash for this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I chose to buy with my own
pocket money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also tip your budtender when you're
buying shit you guys that fucking tip jar
[SPEAKER_00]: was not full enough today for how many
cars were in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that tip jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is dabbing more expensive than smoking
flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are the type of person that likes
to just have a pipe in your hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bowl and just be puffing on
something all the time, maybe maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: flour will get expensive because I like to
take a dab and then maybe to take a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I wait an hour, maybe two hours
for another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'll take two or three dabs and
then wait an hour or two for another one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, you know, I like to have that
pipe in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just carry my bowl around and hit a bowl
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to know that if you're just
sitting there watching a Netflix video or
[SPEAKER_00]: a YouTube video, you don't have to get out
the torch and heat up the fucking dab nail
[SPEAKER_00]: and do all that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just pick up your lighter,
pick up your bowl, take a couple of quick
[SPEAKER_00]: puffs off the bowl and just enhance the
buzz that you've already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of keeps it going, keeps riding
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're the kind of person that likes
to keep toking on something, you may go
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of your concentrates super
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're the kind of person that can
just take a dab every hour, a dab every
[SPEAKER_00]: two hours, and they're not gigantic dabs,
it could be more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was joking earlier about all of that
fancy equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people have $3,000 rigs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people buy custom made torches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people buy $1,000 carb cap?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a $30 carb cap sitting right there
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I buy the one that's $1,200 and
fucking purple and faceted and has all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different colors of glass in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a cultural thing to that's a
way to flex to show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wear chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people drive fast cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us like to wear fancy shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people prefer to show off that
they're doing okay by having a really
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy glass setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of us we do it often all day
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could definitely say I'm passionate
about consuming cannabis and consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it only makes sense to have and in
Rastafari, we call it the chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of my ceremony, part of my
connection with the most I job,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of my connection with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not have something that's ornate
and decorative and makes me smile when I
[SPEAKER_00]: see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why a lot of people spend
extravagant, extraordinary money on a rig
[SPEAKER_00]: that is shaped like their favorite cartoon
character or that's got their favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: color scheme or is orange and has crazy
spirals on it and hits just the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe a lot of times it's just an
artist that they are buying from is very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known and has a good reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like if you wanted to buy a really
fancy painting from an artist that's well
[SPEAKER_00]: known, you're going to pay extra money for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to buy a painting from me,
it's a dollar because nobody knows who the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: My paintings are cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the glass game and art goes just like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to have nice shit just to
show you that they're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will just save all their money
for that one real nice ornate fucking rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a nice rig, a nice carb cap and
their smoke session, their smoke ceremony
[SPEAKER_00]: is top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking the best concentrates they
can through the best piece they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself I prefer a rig that is not super
ornate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of rigs, a few rigs that
are quite decorated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got I've got one with a really
stylish star of David on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm afraid that I'm going to bump
it on something and break that star of
[SPEAKER_00]: David off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pass it to a buddy and it's
going to get broken and I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbroken because it's beautiful
artwork, which that's what happens when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite rig is what I call
functional scientific glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a spot for your banger to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a downstream that splits off two
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It percolates on two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small rig that fits in the palm of
my hand with the mouthpiece that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call a sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mouthpiece is flared out like
a like a fucking exhaust pipe or a
[SPEAKER_00]: trumpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have one of those like a PP
shaped mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make a funky lip funky lip
shape to try to hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flared out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that I get a better dab
because my mouth fits better on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to make a funky face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take monstrous dabs compared to a lot of
people bigger dabs than you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the smaller the PP shape,
the phallic kind of shape mouthpieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of buildup around my lips when
I take a dab of fat, a fat dab of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates with that flared mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get that effect because there's
more surface area for that dab to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get all sticky lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some rants on why we buy
expensive rigs, rig preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just they're trying to flex a lot
of young kids, a lot of fucking other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks are just saying, hey, look,
I did all right one month or a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months I saved up or I just fucking maxed
out the credit card and I got this rig I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna set it on the table and everyone's
gonna go ooh ah, then we're all gonna dab
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really ornate piece that we
could be proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can support and show off one of
your favorite artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dabbing prices versus flower prices,
that's debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy top or bottom shelf product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get a top shelf product or
bottom shelf product when it comes to dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: or when it comes to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people buy bottom shelf
concentrates and complain that that store
[SPEAKER_00]: sells shitty product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to any store and you buy the
bottom shelf shelf shit, expect bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's concentrates or flowers,
don't complain about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're buying pens, pens can get
a little bit expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cartridges are like 30 to 50 or
something bucks for a I think it's a half
[SPEAKER_00]: a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's point five of whatever's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a liquid unit of measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that measurement wasn't
prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can get expensive quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I love how discreet they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to be in a place where we
really aren't supposed to smoke or consume
[SPEAKER_00]: products, I could just say I've got to go
to the bathroom and I can allegedly
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly take three to four good rips off
of a pen, one in the hallway, two while
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking a piss and one in the hallway
on the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can get fairly ripped off of a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to go to a concert,
you don't want to take the dab torch or
[SPEAKER_00]: your joints and shit into the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of pens, take those right on in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke with a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pins are semi cost effective for
what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're great for their price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a good battery and a good
cartridge, that you can replace their cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for what they are for their
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a casual smoker, if you're not a
heavy dabber, those pins will get you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do double pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the double dragon, put a pin in
each side of my mouth and hit two pins at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a big fat cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is wax wax is cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a shatter or wax,
that shit should be like 15, maybe 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, maybe $22 a gram depending where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also SHO solventless honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's anywhere from 85 to $150 a
gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some of what they call Percy
rosin, personal rosin from some companies
[SPEAKER_00]: will run you $150 per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on how hard you want to flex
with your equipment and your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to buy affordable stuff and
just be satisfied, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to throw your whole wallet and
your whole fucking paycheck at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and at the fucking glass store,
that is also an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a sip of this marvelous
coconut pineapple juice out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful grow from your heart rig and
then we will continue this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sips tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is delicious and tropical and
refreshing all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that covers up that part of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next part of this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you hardly ever talk about what
you're dabbing on before the show anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that by choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons that
factored into that politely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touched on this a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me to advertise for their
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a little bit of a discount from my
friends at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Colorado
Cannabis Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually the ones that hook me up
and give me good deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the concentrate companies reached
out or replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talked about doing a sponsorship
deal or an advertising deal, I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I'm smoking your shit on 600
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to work out a deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just help me with concentrates or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not going to respond,
I'm not going to give them a boost on
[SPEAKER_00]: every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems fair that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still enjoy the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still smoking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my polite way of saying nobody
wanted to do an advertising deal,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're not going to get free
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a capitalist attitude,
but advertising is expensive and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it for free to be quite honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be completely honest and
transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a fucking completely honest
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of why I stopped talking about what
I'm smoking, because it's always the same
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told you who I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer their batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The live batter is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will smoke the full spectrum extract if
that's what you give me, but I prefer the
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I didn't think anybody really cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of comments like,
hey bro, nobody cares what you're fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we just move on with the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: If people don't care what I'm talking
about, then there's no sense in talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, so I just moved on with the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I was going to mention,
I've been taking less dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clear my throat less on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is less itchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the show is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show has only been 25 to 32 minutes
long lately, because I don't spend fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: six extra minutes talking about dumb shit
because I'm too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the show has been better
with less dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been more functional and I'm not
dabbing super hard before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to take like fucking six dabs
before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, I took two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three fatty dabs tonight before I did this
podcast, but I didn't try to dab myself
[SPEAKER_00]: into a fucking coma like I used to do,
so that is also part of why I don't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about why or what I'm dabbing so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest answer, nobody's paying me for the
free advertising they've been getting for
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think anybody gave a shit and
I've been dabbing less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took a couple of dabbing days
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the doctor just for a regular
checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a cold that lasted a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to go make sure that I was okay
during this season, which we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doc's like, no, you're young and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the things I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor said, are you addicted to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor said, do me a favor,
give me three days without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'll see you three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you five.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doc said, game on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went three days and I was like,
that was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't smoke a single dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't eat any edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking living large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went five days and I was like,
this is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm gonna try to go seven full
days without smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went seven full days without smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to seven days, I decided let's
go 10 days and there's just something in
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in me clicked and I was like,
well, let's do 10 days and at day 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like 10 days was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do 11 and I thought the challenge
was three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it 11 on day 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab and I got high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I was high school high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to chill out on the couch for a
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to regroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to recoup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to write my name down on a fucking
piece of paper and keep looking at it just
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember who the shit I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized at that point when dabs weren't
affecting me, I could take fucking three
[SPEAKER_00]: fat dabs and do whatever you needed done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're at work and you're like,
hey, corporate called.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be hitting the dab rig and blow
out my dab and talk to corporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't talk about some of the
physical activities that I did with
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery and driving equipment and stuff,
but allegedly I could still do all that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit just fine, which meant something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I took 11 days off and took a dab
that nearly incapacitated me, maybe I was
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I was just dabbing too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I took my little break, I feel like
I'm working back up to where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took another couple of day breaks and
then I would smoke for like a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: then take a day or two off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've been taking little breaks,
I get much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buzz is much more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sticks around for a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'll blow out that dab and my
eyes get heavy and I'm like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to grab onto the table and make sure I
don't float away or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it was really advantageous to
take that little bit of a dab break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was dabbing a little bit less is one
of the reasons why you didn't hear me
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I'm dabbing on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor said, give me three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'll see your three and give
you five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in my brain like the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went 11 days without a dab day 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got fucking wrecked you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it taught me a lot about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It taught me that maybe I'm not smoking
medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm not smoking recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm just smoking fucking habitually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even about chasing the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even about feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even keeping myself healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just when I'm sitting here editing
a podcast or writing a podcast or watching
[SPEAKER_00]: a YouTube video, I got some time to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest thing was after I would eat a
fat meal was to not go take a big fat dab
[SPEAKER_00]: after I ate because that's one of my
favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You finish up a meal, put the dishes in
the sink, clean yourself up, go take a fat
[SPEAKER_00]: drink or something to get all that spicy
out of your mouth because I eat a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: spicy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at whoever you're with
and you go, you're ready for some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody goes, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you head into wherever you take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go get the rig and you take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you got some sort of routine like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the hardest part for me was not
dabbing after every single fucking meal
[SPEAKER_00]: that I put in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running out of time, but there are
more parts to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the next next page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says since dabbing concentrates or
sometimes as high as 70%, does that ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: your tolerance of smoking flour at all or
do you still get a buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned before, tolerance breaks
are key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yes, I am getting stoned again when I
smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to smoke flour because I'm a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll breed some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get to select which phenotype gets
me the better buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a lot to do with what gets
selected for next breeding projects gets
[SPEAKER_00]: moved forward with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to smoke those flowers,
which means I need to be able to feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, taste the aromas and flavors and
enjoy that flower to make good decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the question again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so stoned I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still get a buzz from smoking
flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because I do take tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bit of a different buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that a lot of times dabbing will
make me bug eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this beanie over my face right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dabbing makes me like, whoa,
I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But smoking good flour makes my eyes heavy
and makes me like, oh, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the evening, in the nighttime
when I'm chilling out, I like to carry
[SPEAKER_00]: around that bowl and just hit on a bowl or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing shaving, getting in the
shower, editing a podcast, I got the dab
[SPEAKER_00]: rig and the bowl next to me so I can hit
that bowl, smoke those flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: get myself nice and chilled out nice and
mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned earlier, I like that
comfort of just carrying a bowl around
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having that bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's because I've been a pothead for
fucking 20 something 30 something years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just knowing that I've got that bowl,
even if I'm not going to smoke it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but just knowing that this is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I decide just to smoke this bowl,
I can just take a couple of puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got to do is put this one thing in
my pocket with this other thing in my
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket and flick one and rub it on the
other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lighter, I got a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be stoned whenever we want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a nice security feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having a security blanket right
there in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pull it out, get stoned whenever I
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concentrates are as high as 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are like in the 80s, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, 83.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here 70.90.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some high ranking concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the bubblegum T 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great taste and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me nice and stony today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one and the garlic banger have had me
in a nice buzz today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that is all I've got
time for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys actually have to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some other things that I have to do
