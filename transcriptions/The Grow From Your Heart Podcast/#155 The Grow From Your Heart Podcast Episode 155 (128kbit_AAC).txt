[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 155 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, I want to thank you guys again for
[SPEAKER_00]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys are having a great evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're taking some dabs with me,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've got a blunt rolled up with
some hash down the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing something to adjust
your vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're getting nice and iry with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some big fat dabs of some
taffy and Cascade Nug Run Shatter from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually kind of had a sort of a
pineapple aftertaste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you hear this, that'll all be
sold out because they sell that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly over at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in this episode, I am going to
address some emails that have been sent to
[SPEAKER_00]: me and some questions that I received on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really good question that I
have titled the turp sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about why
somebody's got some sizzling turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, before we get that
far, I do need to make a very special
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about getting my hash at
Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I was known as the
master grower or the lead cultivator or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no longer involved with Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friends with everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt and I are still bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amy and I are still bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a chick, but we're still bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay and I are definitely still bros
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breezy and I were never real close bros,
but I mean Breezy and I are still bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got no problem with the Green and
Healthy Crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just no longer a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am moving on to do different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus more on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus more on my stuff instead
of working for another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate the opportunity
they gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a different vision and I want to
do my own thing to tell you the damn
[SPEAKER_00]: truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm no longer part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the entire Green and Healthy
Wellness crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that everybody
knows I am no longer a part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails and questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me a lot of things about the
commercial growth from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to be straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no longer a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell am I doing since I'm no
longer there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on my breeding projects,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got some, I've been talking about
the breeding project here on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about 50 days into flower at this
point, which means it's probably close to
[SPEAKER_00]: 35-ish days since it has been pollinated,
which means in about seven to 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 14 days, I'm keeping a real close
eye on it, I will be able to chop these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down and I will be able to harvest
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the plants dry up, I'll pull
the seeds out and then I'll be able to let
[SPEAKER_00]: them dry a little bit and then I'll
package them up and I'll get them in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: of my friends' hands and we will see what
a RISE F2 has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what comes from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a Grateful Dog female
pollinated by the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to see what that's
gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Lemon Skunk pollinated by the
Arise and of course, I did the Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by the Arise in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will be done in like 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pulling, I've pulled three seeds
out total so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to do investigation, I have to see
what's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get a seed in a normal spot of the
plant, pull one seed out, clean it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually tried to germinate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are with the breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot more breeding projects
planned and lined up and charted and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the females are gonna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what male I'm gonna use and there
is going to be some heat coming up from
[SPEAKER_00]: the iReGenetics gardens very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's what's going on with
the breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I'm gonna cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Elevate and the new dab rig
they gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I mentioned it on the last
episode, but they gave me a sweet dab rig
[SPEAKER_00]: with a Lion of Judah on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of coughing a little bit,
but it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have I been doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: On Monday night, I got the honor to go see
one of my favorite reggae artists,
[SPEAKER_00]: the master, Sisla Kalanji was at Cervantes
Masterpiece Ballroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an opening act by the name of
Dubskin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I had seen Dubskin before and
didn't like them, but I was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band that played that night that was
called Dubskin was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their drummer was very charismatic and
played very creative reggae beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, a reggae drummer is either
boring or really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either lock in and you play reggae
beats or you kind of fill in and you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys that gets on top of
it and plays a lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked his sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the way he played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dubskin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a great set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very Colorado-esque reggae is my best way
to describe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course Sisla Kalanji came on
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something happened when the band switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Dubskin left and Sisla came on,
something in the soundboard happened and
[SPEAKER_00]: the drums sounded like shit when Sisla
came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a sound guy, but I obviously run a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a soundboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really bummed out when the drums
sounded like shit, but I tried to get past
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to look for the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was seeing one of my favorite reggae
artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to show appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to show some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sisla puts on an amazing show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude put on, he used more energy in
an hour and 30 minutes set than most of us
[SPEAKER_00]: use it in our entire day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came out on stage in a long sleeve
button-up shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long his dreadlocks are,
but I assume they are quite long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he always keeps them tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's always got his dreads and a
turban on his head, so he's got a turban
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with dreadlocks on his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's under the lights at the concert and
he's running in place basically for an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and a half and singing and not
missing a beat while singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude was covered in sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like he ran through the
sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude put out huge energy even though
he was kind of frustrated with the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched enough stage shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell that the drummer couldn't
hear the monitor mix, so he was falling
[SPEAKER_00]: off the beat a little bit trying to listen
to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking up the singer and the
singer was getting mad and was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: showing it a little bit, but it was a
great show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get the chance to see Sisla
Kalanji, go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you get a chance to see a show at
Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave all your fancy shit at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to park right there with a
bunch of fancy shit in your car though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a sketchy area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to some of the emails that I
have received because I've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about my stuff for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm opening up an email right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm unlocking the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a screenshot of a message I
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit clearing my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from a friend on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls himself TerpsOnly710 and they
said, Hey Rasta Jeff, just recently I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gifted some pure Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I've encountered these
before, so I don't know too much besides
[SPEAKER_00]: they taste great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, you guys, I'm trying so hard not to
cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it out of my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cough, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a small dab of some other
concentrate, then drop a drip of Terps on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it comes out great and tastes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is the Terps make the dab sizzle
a tiny bit, not like the 4th of July Tain
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain status, but definitely a small
sizzle that wouldn't have happened to the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate without the added Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also said, any info would be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time podcast listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say, can honestly say I've
listened to all episodes since episode one
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like we're the best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening for that long,
we're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to Chris Hardwick,
the Nerdist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following Chris Hardwick
basically since he was on Singled Out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen Chris Hardwick spiral out of
control and ruin his career and then get
[SPEAKER_00]: his shit back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Chris Hardwick is on top of his
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard Chris Hardwick say several
years ago that all he ever wanted to do
[SPEAKER_00]: was play Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see Chris Hardwick at the
Oddball Comedy Tour a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: play Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt like I was watching one of my
friends reach his goals because I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: following him for so long and I listened
to his podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely know what you mean about
us being friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ever meet, if I walk past you at an
event, if we're in the same area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you better come say what's up and
introduce yourself because we're friends
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you've listened since episode
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm embarrassed when I think about episode
one, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sticking along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked about dab sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as long as it's not going too
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I'm going to say is you
might have your nail just a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot when you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to let the nail cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the e-nail, turn it down
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting too much sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's happening is I'm going to pick
up my little jar of turps here and let
[SPEAKER_00]: these turps talk me through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps are liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least my turps are completely liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding them in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could pour them out of this little vial
if I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are completely liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're putting that liquid onto your
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you might be using a little bit
more than necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pouring it onto there and it's
sizzling when you dab it, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to put about half of that and
conserve your dabs a little bit and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it last twice as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're still going to get the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still going to get everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excessive too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do big fat dabs with way too
much turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's sizzling, that might be part
of the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's happening is you're just
putting moisture on a hot nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would put water on a hot nail,
it would sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in the summer when you get
sweaty and you have to manhandle your
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter with your fingers because there's
no other way to pick it up or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a dab will sizzle from that too,
because it's got moisture from your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that's happening is basically
you're boiling the turps on the hot nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they hit the nail, it's just like
you're throwing some water in a skillet
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going, and you're just getting
that sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be using too much turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just check those two things out or
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you like the way it works,
do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're into, do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take too big of a dab with way too many
turps on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with your turps that
I know of from that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like just science happening
because I'm going to take a drink and
[SPEAKER_00]: another dab and hopefully get rid of this
thing in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be cool for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for dealing with my coughs,
my throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I was talking about turp
sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you have too much of a
problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions about your
turps, please send that message to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear more about your
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of turps are you dabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you get them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you sure those are
cannabis-derived terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, our next email came from
Mazar421 and he says, Greetings,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to hear your thoughts on
question number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always reading and researching on
cannabis cultivation for endless hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you could list your top three
books that you have found a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: information from or have heard good things
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to the internet for answers,
but the problem with the internet is that
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody can post anything and I find a lot
of bullshit posted on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see people giving people advice that
is just going to lead to more problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting to the root of the
evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Hey, I've got this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well then do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh shit, that's just going
to make the problem you've got even worse
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause three more problems down the
line that you're not aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to teach new growers to avoid the
internet a little bit because the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: can be really full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to go is trusted books from
trusted authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know three books,
I would highly recommend the first one I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend for everybody is called
marijuana botany and advanced study,
[SPEAKER_00]: the propagation and breeding of
distinctive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's a really long title,
but if you go to amazon.com and you search
[SPEAKER_00]: for marijuana botany by Robert Connell
Clark, you will find that book it's less
[SPEAKER_00]: than $20 with free shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the book I would start with
marijuana botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go with another trusted
classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go with the marijuana horticulture
indoor outdoor medical growers Bible from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge is kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, both of the authors I've told
you about are kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of the authors I'm going to tell
you about are kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've started, they started growing
cannabis and breeding cannabis probably
[SPEAKER_00]: before I was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys have been doing it for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of their techniques are very old and
they seem a little outdated, but this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys were doing it right back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shit still works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like karate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to learn the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start off as a white belt and your
goal is to get that that crystal the green
[SPEAKER_00]: belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to start off as a white belt,
get these books, get a good foundation and
[SPEAKER_00]: then build on that from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first book again was marijuana
botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second book is the marijuana
horticulture indoor outdoor medical
[SPEAKER_00]: growers Bible from Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep updating that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can find it on Amazon for
like 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third book I would recommend is
Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is actually the Oakster Dam course
guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the book that they use at Oakster
Dam in California to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book is very in depth and I really
like the way it's laid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches you the basics of how to set up
a grow, excuse me, how to set up a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to maintain your setup, what size of a
grow to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches you about how to find males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches you about cloning, vegging,
flowering, teaches you how to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, how to identify bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers
handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also known as your complete
guide for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I'm looking at it right now on
Amazon for 23.99 with $4.99 shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if I shopped around a little bit
we could find it for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the first three books I would
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a book by Soma that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have the book sitting next to me
right now, but it's a small thin paperback
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis book from Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then DJ Sure also wrote a book by the same
publisher that Soma's book is out from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also a book called Let's Grow
a Pound, which is a very useful book in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Let's Grow a Pound from
Seymour Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that book would do every grower
some justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from day one of the grow all the
way up to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very helpful guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm thinking about it,
let's throw in a book called Secrets of
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast Masters by a dude named
Drew West.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be plenty of books to get you
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a lot of those books on PDF
form for free on the internet somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick search and you should be able
to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those books will be available on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions that you
need answered with more depth or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: need more interaction, feel free to send
me more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know my email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my favorite books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to part two of your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two of your question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have read that digital ballots can mess
with and disrupt radio signals like ham
[SPEAKER_00]: radio and wifi cable reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know this to be true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard you are all right as long
as they have something called an RF
[SPEAKER_00]: shield?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, thanks again for the
love on the show and keep dabbing and
[SPEAKER_00]: sipping on that drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny because I said I need a
little sip one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew somebody was gonna give me shit
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about digital ballasts that
mess with and disrupt radio signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do put off a frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that frequency matches your TV or
your radio, it could definitely cause
[SPEAKER_00]: interference or be picked up by something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is most of the digital ballasts
available work at a much higher frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: than what most personal electronics would
work at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them are in the 200 range and
most of your personal appliances are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 60 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should not have any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does happen, you are usually using
a lot of ballasts like more than 15 or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be enough ballast to disrupt
some signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you're getting imported Chinese
ballasts that are poorly made from other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries and they have a lower frequency
vibration and those will be more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that people are worried about is
that they're putting off an RF frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: and that frequency is able to be picked up
by law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes a lot of people paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the new ballasts are made with an
RF shield inside of them and they're at
[SPEAKER_00]: such a high frequency that it will not
disrupt your household appliances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not disrupt your wifi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day that was a thing,
but they've kind of solved that problem
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: An alternative to the new digital
ballasts, you could go with your old
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with those is it's hard to
take good photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make your pictures look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either have the digitals and you
can be paranoid about the RF frequency or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have those old magnetics and you
can take shitty pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really don't think you have anything
to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the new ballasts, you should be
just fine in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge article on THC Farmer about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to read about it on THC
Farmer, that's where I did my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those guys bicker about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I read, I think we'll all be
okay with our digital ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dude, I truly appreciate your
interaction and your emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep dabbing and sipping on that
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep sending me good emails like
this, I appreciate your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazar421.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Artie and
he says, Hey Rasta Jeff, don't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: the episode, but you mentioned a female
plant dying as soon as you put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room with the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had the same exact thing happen
except my damn killer male plant shriveled
[SPEAKER_00]: up and died within 48 hours of entering
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea on either situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to see that black cherry kim soon,
Artie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a long time ago, I did a breeding
project where I had a reversed,
[SPEAKER_00]: was I putting the, okay, I had a reversed
golden goat in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a golden goat that was a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied silver thiosulfate to it for
about 14 days before I put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued applying silver thiosulfate to
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This golden goat plant became a male that
produced male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put female plants in that room so
that they can receive that pollen and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody, so I put, I timed the
plants differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants go in early, some plants go in
later for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put the plants in, most of the girls
looked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a clone of headband in that room to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a female and it looked okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the pollen from that reversed
golden goat plant hit that female headband
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, that plant shriveled up and died
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not know what caused it because
all of the plants in that room got treated
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feed was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of water they got was basically
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was overfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was underfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was over or underwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything seemed legit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, when the pollen hit
that plant, the whole plant fucking died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no idea what caused it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to other breeders about it and
they all scratched their heads and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at me like I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I don't know if
something else was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happened,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy said he had something similar
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said his killer male plant shriveled up
and died within 48 hours of entering the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any idea on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you took a male plant from a veg room
and then you put it into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room to initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 48 hours, it straight up
croaked and died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know offhand what would cause
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few guesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to know was that
plant, is this a soil or a hydro grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I really am curious
about because soil is much more forgiving
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydro, you have more option to damage
the roots and everything happens much more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would explain a little bit more if
it were hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my main questions, did it go from like
a T5 light to right underneath a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that may have been a little bit
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have just fucking microwaved it or
barbecued it or broiled it, however you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have just put that little tiny
plant that came from a T5 or a little
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you moved it to a thousand and put the
thousand too close, you might have roasted
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have just overpowered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't ready for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it too much energy and it died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have had too little light also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have gone from your thousand watt
in your veg room where there was only that
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant and you had all the space and
then you put it in the other room and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you hit it between a bunch of girls
and it didn't get enough air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it got too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it got too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it got too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you carried it into the flower room
or when you put it in the flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: did you get excited and overwater it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, this sucker is going to be a
beast and you overwater it or did you
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeed it or did it need nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could walk into your grow room and
look at the room and the other plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another question I need to ask
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do the other plants look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have other plants in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have females in there that look
happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the females in the room look
happy, then it's just this one plant we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all the plants are shitty,
then it's the room we have to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could walk into the room with
plants and see what's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could just walk in, take a quick
look around the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your source of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how you're getting rid of the old
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how you're handling humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things I would like to
see in there that would help me answer
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm not able to view your
room through my brain yet in the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be so handy when we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just teleport to your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check it out right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to send me some pictures or
send me some follow-ups to all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I just said, I will talk about
it further on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on because it is
really strange that you put a plant into a
[SPEAKER_00]: room and it died within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on all the things that I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably checked all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like an experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably all the stuff you went
to right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was hydro and you moved it from
another room to another room, I'm assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some root damage is what caused
that plant to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because last night I transplanted a medium
amount of clones from an easy cloner into
[SPEAKER_00]: solo cups with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got kind of hasty and I was in a
hurry and I felt myself kind of fuck one
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I pushed the soil down, I felt it
press too hard and I've kind of felt the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, that plant's all drooped over and
looks really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may pull through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spare that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having 100% success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have 99 because of that
fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just a little bit of root damage on a
hydro plant is a huge difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: happiness compared to just a soil plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't mess up the roots as much on a
soil plant is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the bottom line is I really don't
know what caused your plant to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better answer for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you had a clone of that male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you just got to get some seeds and
do some more pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you email me back, let me know what
strain you were working with and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds you went through to find that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got questions for you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about this more on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Artie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for that
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear back from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I received two emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was about LEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's light emitting ceramic lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new 315 seemed to be really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company that makes the 315 is just to
put out a smaller version, a lower wattage
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't paid too much attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do some research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got an email about LED,
light emitting diode lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you guys, I have never grown
with an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never grown with an LEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used some T5s and some thousand watt
HPSs and some thousand watt metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some fours and sixes,
but I mean, I've never done anything other
[SPEAKER_00]: than high intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to find the people that make
the 315s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you can put me in touch with
the guy that makes the 315s, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: get him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have him email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can find him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would like to have somebody that
represents, manufactures or works with an
[SPEAKER_00]: LED company or somebody that has grown
with LEDs a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like you to come on the show and teach
us about LEDs and maybe run us through the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences of LED lighting and HID
lighting because I honestly don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in that department.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a pro with that and you're able
to articulately tell our listeners about
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, I'd love to get you on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've got for you about LEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: LECs and LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got a
question you'd like me to talk about on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we're going to talk
about a recent cease and desist letter
[SPEAKER_00]: that was sent to the cannabis lounges in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also answer a few more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I want to thank everybody that
sent me messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer it if you sent me the
messages at growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to get in touch with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're already corresponding on
Instagram or wherever it is, keep doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But new messages, I would love to get
those at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love building content based on your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets me know I'm hitting my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know I'm helping people out
with information they actually need
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just talking about random
things that aren't helping anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy, John Randall Jr. John, boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you would like to sponsor the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you've got a product you'd like me
to review, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it one more time,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to check out your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, now that the show is
over, I would love it if you go to iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the iTunes store, search for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, find the
[SPEAKER_00]: review section, type in a comment,
let me know what you think about the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will read your comment on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're there, you have the
option to give me some stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'd ask for a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, give me what you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on some stars, type in a comment,
let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'd love it if you guys follow me on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got
for you this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence,
and until next time, take a fat dab and
[SPEAKER_00]: give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just chilling on the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listening to the music from Jamaica to
Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we decided to go link the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need something for the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy as a lark when the good vines stir
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the chanting starts, you get burning
fuel corrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke all day, and still we got the
earth to rub up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Babel and he rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give thanks for the stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep the meditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music and more music, we burn the pagans.
[SPEAKER_01]: No ifs, no buts, no argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana is my holy sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay above the wicked Zen flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pour the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks and precise desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: All when Babylonians going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
