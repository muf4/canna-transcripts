[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 369 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of something called
fluffernutter sauce from Contraband
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at a cut above and called
it Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff has a very unique aroma and
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bust the container open again
just to get a fresh smell to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that dryer sheet sort of smell
that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the concentrates from Contraband
have that dryer sheet turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which turp that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body really likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got almost a citrus thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let it sit on the nose for a
minute and you just give it a nice smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it rest, it has a really warm
aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something warm in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tell me that my strain
descriptions are completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you bought a gram of this and you
cracked it open and gave it a smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would say that is sweet with a hint of
citrus with a little warmth at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would probably agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I always love the high of the
products I buy from Contraband
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always got that nice head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe that sharp dryer sheet
sort of aroma has something to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: head buzz that I get from this
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they always do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the fluffernutter sauce
from Contraband Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously got me nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of great information
written down for you in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to it, I would like to
give a few people some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with Brett Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant shout out to Brett
Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to Aldridge once
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally appreciate that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a shout out to Sam and Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate that.

[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need will be right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thanks for all the
support, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to do another
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that series, we set a goal for our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a safe place for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've selected the appropriate equipment
for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also selected the appropriate
nutrients and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also selected the best management
system for that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have either sprouted seeds or
potted some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this point of our grow,
we have got clones or seedlings in small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably six to 10 inches tall at
this point and they are developing nice
[SPEAKER_00]: fat roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are in these grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, I plan to talk a little
bit more about small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue that conversation
since time has progressed since we put our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into the small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to work my way into talking
about micro products and root development
[SPEAKER_00]: and the importance of healthy roots and
the benefits of using a quality micro
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this episode may feel like a
recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will be a recap, but we will
work our way right into our current state,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like it's good to remind
people not everybody listens to every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, so I like to get people up to
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I move forward, I do need to
correct myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a mistake on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I was talking about
ideal lighting for our small plants and I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I completely overlooked ceramic
metal halide lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halide lighting is a very
viable and useful option.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your small plants, if you feel like I
left you out by not mentioning the CMH
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are quality lights and I recommend
new growers to use those lights for small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is an option, they are affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put out a lot of light and they
don't use a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a ceramic metal halide light is a very
viable option for a small grow for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to step up, move up from
the 315s to the 630s, I've seen great
[SPEAKER_00]: results with those in a flowering room as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let me forget the ceramic metal
halide lighting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a viable option in a
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on track and talk more
about continuing our small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what I consider small veg are small
plants, anything basically from a cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: or a seedling that is in a small pot,
maybe like a four inch pot, maybe a six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch net pot, maybe all the way up to an
eight inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our smaller plants that don't have a
super strong, healthy developed root
[SPEAKER_00]: system are plants that are probably only
eight to 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I am considering my small
veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now up to this point, we've mainly been
focusing on healthy pest and pathogen free
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you check every day for the
presence of pests or pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as the plants are small, we still
need to pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip a leaf over.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see any weirdness on the bottom
of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the tops of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any stippling?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any gooey stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flick some of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flick some of the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see anything fly out?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sign of either fungus gnats or
white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're white, they're white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're black, they're probably fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention for pests in our small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to take care of them if
we do get them, but we need to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: our problems early so that we can conquer
them before they get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in and check for pests every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to spot it on these
little plants very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start in the center of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will usually start at the whitest point
of one of your biggest leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will look like somebody just took a
little drop of donut powdered sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: just dropped it right on your leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like some sort of white powdery
water that dried up and just left a little
[SPEAKER_00]: stain right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first indicator of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably happen in a low light
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not getting a lot of light,
but there is a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes it will happen where that
little bit of water just hangs on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf in that one spot and it never quite
goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to get the PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal right now is to keep these
plants pest and pathogen free and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them developing strong, healthy root
systems so that we have strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants when it's time to
transplant them and then later move them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that your plants are starting to grow
and you've spent some time with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably seen what happens when you
over and under water them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably done one or the other,
which has probably caused a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to pull off all of the
ugly leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got yellowing, crispy leaves,
take those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow leaves are an invitation for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use yellow sticky cards in
the garden to help the pests go to those
[SPEAKER_00]: cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them on the cards and we can tell
that they're there, but the pests love to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to that yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that is a weak leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you're a hungry spider mite and
you see a big, healthy, robust leaf that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a really thick layer of healthy
vegetation to chew through before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get some nutrients out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or imagine just a little lower on the
plant, you've got a weak leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yellow on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real thin layer and you can
just poke right through it and suck all
[SPEAKER_00]: the juice you want right out of it like a
hungry little vampire bug you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go right to those weak
yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as much work for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get right in there and get what
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites are going right for that
yellow weak part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull off all those weak parts,
pull off all the yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problems are going to
start anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the plant is the weakest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're pulling off leaves,
you may notice that the couple of branches
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very bottom of your plant are just
weak and shitty and kind of in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a couple of leaves that are
hanging down into the dirt, pick that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that very bottom crap on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it makes it to flower,
we're going to clean up the bottom eight
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 inches of that stock anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottom branches will not even be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you take some of those
little sucker branches off the bottom now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will encourage growth up to the top of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that stuff on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's not going to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problems are going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not cut that stuff right off?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with the way your plants
look without pruning anything off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, you don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got two or three branches on
the bottom that just aren't growing to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the rest of the branches,
if they look weak, why not take them off?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that weak shit down there at
the bottom of the plant wasting energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting nutrients and wasting water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just cut it right off and send that
energy right up to the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as the plants get bigger,
you'll notice they're starting to branch
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottoms of some of the branches,
you may start developing shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those little shoots are weak,
you can pinch those off as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to take off the entire
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just take off the shitty shoots at
the bottom and you can still leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: ends of those branches and you can still
have more bud sites and more branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take off too much now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always take off more in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot glue branches back onto the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, the plant grows out of
the top, so the shit you take off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom will not replace itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cleaning up the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend starting off with light
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are showing any yellow or
if they're not growing as quickly as you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like them to, you may need to
increase the overall amount of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: we are giving the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend starting low and
increasing as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are a little bit pale or
yellowish, if they're not as green as we
[SPEAKER_00]: would hope they would be at this point,
it is probably time to increase our
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it may be time to add some Kalamag
to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are growing properly,
if they're nice and robust, if they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice root system in this small pot,
I would recommend adding a small dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalamag once a week to your feeding
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're feeding your
plants properly, you're giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: proper amount of nitrogen, you're giving
them the proper amount of Kalamag,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also giving them some beneficials
for the roots and you're not seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth you would like to see, I would
suspect that it's probably a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the pH of the solution you are
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pH is off, your plants won't be
able to uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means they will not grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have mixed up your nutrients,
put your pH pin in there and see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of that solution is before you feed it
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not in the appropriate range,
adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such an overlooked step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time when people send me
pictures of their plants, they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is wrong with my plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask them, what was the pH of your last
feeding solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what most of their answers are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually tell them, check the pH and
get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back to me because I would assume if
you're not checking the pH, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even bother to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know if you've got another
nutritional problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know if you're overfeeding or
underfeeding a specific nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't know what the pH of your
solution is, you've got to dial in the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on the
importance of pH for these small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think they would be happiest with
the pH right around six one or six two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go five eight to six three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to have a wide range,
but I think six one or six two in cocoa or
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix is going to be ideal for
these small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may increase that pH as we go along the
grow process, as we pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and see how they react to certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I think this six point two is
right about where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got clean, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have increased our nutrients to
increase our vigor and increase growth
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably time to spread your plants
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are too pressed together,
if they're too crowded, they are not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to branch out properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got them crushed in there
real tight, it's time to spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like your plants are getting
too tall and too skinny and too stretchy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either want more light or they are
too close together, which probably just
[SPEAKER_00]: means they want more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got branches pressed together,
if you've got leaves pressed together,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got plants overlapping each
other, if you've got one plant pressed up
[SPEAKER_00]: against the wall, they know they're too
tight together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of branching out, they're
going to go straight up and try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all competing for light space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably running your small veg
under smaller lights, which means they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really competing for that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we crowd them in, spread them out,
let them get some light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired nutrient
and source of energy for our plants over
[SPEAKER_00]: their entire life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want light more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants think they're going to get
the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we brought them indoors and wired up
little T5 bulbs and we're trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them grow with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spoil them and give them as much of
that T5 lighting as they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them as much space as they can handle
so that you can get maximum performance
[SPEAKER_00]: from our small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I feel like we've got healthy
plants that are pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably about eight to 10 inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to get nice branching on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cleaned up those crappy branches on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pulled off any funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spread them out so that they're not
too crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are probably going to transplant these
plants into their forever homes within the
[SPEAKER_00]: next week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the next grow lesson
that I provide will be transplanting into
[SPEAKER_00]: our forever homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing we should really focus
on until we transplant is fat root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my plants to be nearly root bound
in these small pots before I transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have to kind of break that root
ball up at transplant to make it explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds crazy, but if you get that root
ball kind of tight in a small pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we transplant it into the next pot,
it will really take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will really see it explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see explosive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a really robust and healthy
plant from the very beginning with a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let these plants grow and get
kind of tight in their pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some roots coming out of the
bottom of your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those roots are nice and white,
that means you are feeding those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: very well, that your plants are very
happy, that they are getting a nice amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of moisture, that they're getting a nice
amount of dry time, that everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: going well inside your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to take a look at your
roots and see what kind of root
[SPEAKER_00]: development you're working with,
don't be afraid to grab a cup or a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with a plant in it and put your finger
over the pot and kind of make a spockhant
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're spreading your ring finger
and your middle finger apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the stalk of the plant right between
those two fingers and then just flip that
[SPEAKER_00]: pot upside down and give it a little bit
of a shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're confident, you can pull that pot
off and you can look directly at the root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start lifting that pot off and the
dirt starts falling out like crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not compact and pressed together,
push it back in there and just leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are not developed enough to try
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start lifting that pot off and all
the dirt stays in one piece and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see those roots, you can just lift that
pot right off and you can take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see those roots wrapped around
inside of there and all the dirt and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots are tight into one piece,
that is what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are almost ready for transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let those get almost root bound
to where the plant is almost filling that
[SPEAKER_00]: container with roots to where it is almost
panicking time to put that into a new pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we wait that long to put it
into our next pot, we get explosive root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth when we transplant it into the next
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like we get less transplant
shock and I feel like the plant is more
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and more prepared to go into its
larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are experienced or confident,
grab a plant, flip it upside down and
[SPEAKER_00]: knock the container off of it and see what
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the dirt goes flying and the roots
come unraveling and hanging out,
[SPEAKER_00]: just plant that back in there really
carefully and it will be okay if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: careful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best not to break any of the
roots, don't disturb the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you've got it out, sprinkle a little
bit of root inoculant powder on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle some Plus Life or some Great
White right onto the roots and put it back
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and that inoculant will encourage
those roots to grow even more quickly than
[SPEAKER_00]: they already were.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I'm going to
press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably take a couple of dabs while
I'm at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get back, we will talk more about
developing healthy roots and we will also
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a dab with me and I will be right
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well-medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well-hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about healthy roots and
mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we transfer our small plants into
their forever homes, we want to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: thick, healthy white roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a big fat root system so that
we've got a well-established plant to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good microbe product will encourage
explosive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the other
advantages of our mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first obvious advantage is more roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: More roots means our plants can eat more,
which means our plants can drink more,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means our plants will grow more
quickly, which means we will produce more
[SPEAKER_00]: branching, which means we will produce
more buds, which is our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first benefit, more roots,
which means more productivity overall from
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great function of our beneficial
fungus is they work as a protective layer
[SPEAKER_00]: or a security guard for our root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They protect against pathogen problems and
illness in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a colony of beneficial
fungus gathered around the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything else tries to get near it,
those colonies say, hey, this is our turf,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fight off any potential pathogens
that want to get to your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our beneficial bacteria work in a
similar function as an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will break down decaying matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will break down nutrients and it will
make it more bioavailable to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants can take that waste and
actually turn it into food and consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it to its benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are using a microbe product,
I don't recommend that you stop using your
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you use them together,
let them team up and create a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in your rhizosphere that will
also create a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have multiple things in there
breaking down the decaying matter that
[SPEAKER_00]: should really encourage a clean,
healthy rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another function of some of our beneficial
bacterias is they aid in the processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that encourage branching and bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by introducing these beneficial
bacteria, you may see more branching and
[SPEAKER_00]: you may see more bud sites in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another great thing that these
beneficial bacterias do is they work to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase essential oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are essential oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential oils are our terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the overall production of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the overall flavor,
aroma and potency of your plants by using
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I try to avoid recommending brand
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several great mycorrhizal
products available at your local grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will list a few products that I have had
great experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have to recommend Recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge made my plants go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the good things about Recharge is
it contains dried molasses, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly feeding the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes do need some sort of fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already got fuel in that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another acceptable myco product is called
Extreme Mycos and they spell mycos with a
[SPEAKER_00]: K.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy a very expensive
micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something that's affordable,
if you're just going to try it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme Mycos is probably one of the most
affordable micro products on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a liquid micro product,
you can get HydroGuard from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Great White.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great White is a powdered micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the powders because you can
sprinkle them directly onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that when
we get to the transplanting episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during transplant, I like to sprinkle
the powders directly onto the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the hole where I'm transplanting my
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also sprinkle some right around the
outside where it's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: These beneficial fungus do not work unless
they actually touch the roots of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That triggers them to germinate and become
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to come in contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sprinkle those powders right onto the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to stick with liquid and use
something similar to the Great White,
[SPEAKER_00]: they make a product called Orca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orca is very similar to the Great White.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took out two specific beneficial
funguses, but I don't think you'll ever
[SPEAKER_00]: notice they are missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just easier to keep them in a liquid
solution without that fungus in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great White also makes a product called
MycoChom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke earlier that I like Recharge
because it's got a product that feeds
[SPEAKER_00]: their beneficials that comes in one
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that make Great White and Orca
have put out a product called MycoChom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product will feed your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains other things that will
encourage root growth and healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that make Great White and Orca
and MycoChom also make a time release
[SPEAKER_00]: granule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm working in a large container,
I like to start that pot with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time release granules already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix up a large batch of soil with my
amendments, with my perlite, with my
[SPEAKER_00]: persilite, and then I will just pour a big
bag of the dried granules from Great White
[SPEAKER_00]: right across the top of that, mix it right
in, put that into the pot and plant right
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like giving them plenty of that
beneficial bacteria really reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock and it really encourages
explosive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another powdered root inoculant I can
recommend is the Plus Life from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the commercial grows in Colorado
are running Veg Bloom, so I would
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage them just to add the Plus Life
product right along the Veg Bloom base
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had great success using the Veg
Bloom product line and adding the Plus
[SPEAKER_00]: Life root inoculant powder along with that
mix and I've used that in grows of all
[SPEAKER_00]: different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it in four light grows and I've
used it in 400 light grows and I like the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it works in all conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more product to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great liquid microbe product is
mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about mammoth pea
is it is highly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing is you do not have to
add anything to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea uses microbes that can sustain
themselves off of the carbon in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown happening within the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a list of great microbe
products I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary in application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary in amount of microbes per
container and they are going to vary
[SPEAKER_00]: widely in prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what works best for you and your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are going to enjoy the dried
powdered forms more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are going to like the liquid
forms more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you simply cannot get the
overpriced expensive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you will only buy the overpriced
expensive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got their style.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommended several products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used each of those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great experience with those
products and I feel like I can recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: those products to you with confidence that
they are going to work in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: under just about any type of conditions or
any type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that you may need to feed
your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that some of the
microbes do contain other additives that
[SPEAKER_00]: will feed themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still encourage you to feed the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes want to eat carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to eat carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a little bit of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbohydrates will give your plants
energy and the carbohydrates will feed
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overdose the carbs trying to feed
them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally suggest starting off with half
of the recommended dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a bottle of a carbohydrate
product and it says feed 40, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you start off with 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants seem happy, you don't need
to increase the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, you can increase the
dosage until you see the plants react
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of growers like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push it as hard as we can and then back
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn the limits of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a newer grower, if you're
not super experienced, just feed it half
[SPEAKER_00]: of that recommended dosage and the plants
will be receiving that nutrition even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see anything happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful overdoing it with a
carbohydrate product late in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will make your buds burn like a
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just turn into a charcoal
briquette and they won't burn very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overdo it with the molasses or a
carbohydrate product, late in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I mentioned MycoChum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a quality product to feed your
microbes and encourage microbe growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage root growth and overall plant
health, check out MycoChum from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that make the Great White product
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to feeding your
microbes, I recommend more frequent
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first time I introduce microbes to
my feeding regimen, I usually give it what
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottle says.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the container says one gram or 25
milliliters, I will add that to my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution and I will water that
right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to get a good start of the
colonization of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give it a good head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them in there and get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my subsequent waterings, I will
probably give it half of the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those products usually say to water it
in once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing it once a week,
I'll reduce the dosage to half and water
[SPEAKER_00]: it every time I water for a couple of
weeks to build a nice solid colony of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus in my rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after I transplant into my three
gallon pots and I get the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: cranking and I've got a nice fat root ball
in that pot, I will start reducing my
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency of inoculant feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, when I'm in flower,
I generally feed plus life once a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's enough through the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got the roots nice and healthy
and everything is developed, I will
[SPEAKER_00]: generally use the plus life to keep
problems away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the root zone nice and clean,
a nice enzymatic product and a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal product again will work to
keep the roots clean and healthy and happy
[SPEAKER_00]: and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just continue the once a week
feeding just to keep everybody clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like plant probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like giving probiotics to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take probiotics for your gut
health, it just has a good, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: good gut biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making a good gut biome for our
plants by feeding them probiotics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are actually mycorrhizal fungus when
it comes to the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I've got one
more thing to talk about and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start wrapping up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are listening or reading or
learning about mycorrhizal fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will hear three words quite frequently
that basically mean the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear the word inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear the word vaccinated and you
will also hear the word infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: These words all basically mean that the
root zone shows the presence of a
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculate our root zone with a fungus
by adding it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now inoculated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that takes hold, it is basically
vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it travels across the root zone,
it is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they sound like scary words,
but in this situation, all three of those
[SPEAKER_00]: words are positive things that we want
happening within our rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you hear the word inoculated,
vaccinated or infected, keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just means basically the presence of
mycorrhizal fungus within our root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, that is my talk
about continuing small, healthy veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also my lesson on mycorrhizal
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in learning a lot
more about mycorrhizal fungi, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend a podcast called Cannabis
Cultivation and Sciences by Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad recently had Jim Egan on the show and
they do a deep dive into mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus and I highly recommend the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already planned this episode to come
out this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was writing this episode and then
Monday, this episode popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautifully timed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a nice introduction from me
and then Tad takes it really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to listen to Tad's
podcast, I highly recommend a notebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to learn a lot about
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn a lot about organic
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn about permaculture and you
will certainly learn about mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the podcast is called Cannabis
Cultivation and Sciences and I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend it if you want to expand your
cultivation knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast World, that's all I've got for you
for this episode.
