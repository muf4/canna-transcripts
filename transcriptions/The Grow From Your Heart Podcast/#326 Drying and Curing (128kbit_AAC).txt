[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be the longest long
awaited, long anticipated dry and cure
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done an episode on determining
ripeness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an episode on harvesting your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is time to dry and cure our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, let's cover a little
bit of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of the grow from your heart
podcast is brought to you by my friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: the hella dank seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need new regular or feminine seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_01]: hella dank seed company.

[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, please support my
friends at the hella dank seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this podcast is brought to you by
our friends at PL grow systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should know what's going on in your
grow room at all times and you can pay
[SPEAKER_01]: close attention with a PL grow minder
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out my friends at PL grow systems
at PL grow dot systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more order of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people let me know that the
episode with dab and granny and giddy up
[SPEAKER_01]: and max had an audio issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, that audio issue has
been corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were frustrated listening to that
show, I encourage you to go back and check
[SPEAKER_01]: out the corrected audio version of that
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being patient with me and big
thanks to everybody who let me know there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a technical issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of technical issues,
I am still working with Stitcher to
[SPEAKER_01]: resolve the technical issues that happen
randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some episodes will play for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some episodes randomly will not play for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only people experiencing the technical
issues are people who are listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast through the Stitcher application
on an Android device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it works for you, sometimes it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what's causing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought we had it narrowed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We corrected a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has done it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will keep working at getting that
resolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't listen to the episodes
through Stitcher, through the application,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can always go to the Stitcher website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find the show there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can find the show on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep all of the episodes
updated on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize if Stitcher is fighting
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tech team and the customer support
team at Stitcher are helping me and we
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot find the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I feel like I've gotten most of
the technical business out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into a podcast, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I like to start the episodes off
by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I've got the honor of dabbing some
sauce made by a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was locally grown and locally
extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy doesn't wanna be mentioned on the
show, so I'm not gonna say his name,
[SPEAKER_01]: but dude, thanks for the great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend grew some cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I bred the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cream is cookies and cream to a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I passed along some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew it, he harvested it, he extracted
it and made sauce out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he was kind enough to bring me a
couple of sample jars and you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost gone because it is so
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought me a little sample of straight,
isolated crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought me a little sample of straight,
isolated turps and he also brought me a
[SPEAKER_01]: sample of the two combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the turps, I've got the
crystals and then I've got the saucy
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture put together at a beautiful ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the mixture smells like cupcake
frosting and cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you take a dab of it,
it tastes like you just took a big bite of
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie dough with cupcake frosting on it
and then when you blow it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells like somebody's baking fresh
cookies in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like warm chocolate chip and
cinnamon cookies filling the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This concentrate is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is super smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a couple of gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no throat tingle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no heaviness on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super smooth, super clean, super delicious
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I know you don't want me to say your
name on the air, but great product,
[SPEAKER_01]: great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a hell of a job with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem is that it is almost
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably got one or two dabs before
this stuff is extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bro, come back with a bigger jar and
let's make a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I'm obviously loving
these cream dabs grown and extracted by a
[SPEAKER_01]: local farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey bro, great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this episode is gonna be really
long, so I've got all of the open ending
[SPEAKER_01]: business covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take a dab, probably the last
two dabs of this cream and when I get
[SPEAKER_01]: back, I will give a long lesson on drying
and curing your freshly harvested cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world, I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am well hydrated and I am ready to talk
about drying and curing your freshly
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me do a quick update from the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last episode, we talked about
harvesting your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about cutting them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about hanging them in a room
upside down in a climate controlled room.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I failed to mention,
you should only hang one crop in a space
[SPEAKER_01]: at a time to prevent re-moisturizing the
first crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cut down one crop and then let it
hang for four or five days, five or seven
[SPEAKER_01]: days and then bring in a fresh crop and
lock that in the same room because what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing is just introducing a whole
bunch of moisture into that room and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just gonna go into the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to re-moisten the other
plants and make them take longer and now
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to kind of restart your dry and
cure process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one crop at a time is ideal hanging in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I should have mentioned
on the episode before and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we are up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's actually get into drying and
curing our freshly harvested cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now after spending four weeks in veg,
eight to 10 weeks in flour, you really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to mess these plants up at the
very end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing is a very critical process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing, you can make the most delicious
buds taste like total shit from drying and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing them improperly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ruin the entire crop at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too scared because I'm gonna
guide you through not ruining it but keep
[SPEAKER_01]: in mind that this is one of the most
critical parts in the growing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge process and a lot of things
can go wrong if you don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take your time and pay attention and
don't rush to smoke your new crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've waited, what do we say,
about 14 weeks probably is what we did the
[SPEAKER_01]: math on, 120 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've grown these plants for 120 days is
about how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not wait a couple of days longer until
they are perfect before you start smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into actually drying and
curing these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the last grow episode was a harvest
episode and it left us with our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging upside down in a room with proper
temps, proper humidity, and minimal light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've been waiting for the sticks for
our plants to snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got plants hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just waiting for the right humidity
within the plants for the sticks to pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sticks should snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for them to snap but not
explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grab a branch of the plant and
you just bend it, you want it to sound
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to go, you don't want it
to explode with dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to fall apart and you
don't want it to be gummy or rubbery or
[SPEAKER_01]: bendy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to bend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to snap and pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sticks should snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger sticks and larger plants are
going to take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skinnier sticks and smaller plants are
obviously going to dry more quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't hold as much moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you took off less leaf or more
leaf, they're going to dry more quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: without the leaf and they're going to take
a little longer with that extra leaf on
[SPEAKER_01]: there because it's going to hold more
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be more moisture in the room,
just more moisture overall to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're waiting for is those sticks
to snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sticks snap, that's when the
container curing process begins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use two different methods for this based
on crop size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that I run commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a commercial setting, we do things a
little differently than we would do in a
[SPEAKER_01]: home setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm used to pulling down 50 or more pounds
in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a bunch of jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really have the space for a
bunch of jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the manpower to open a
bunch of jars all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do things a little differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a home grow, it's not as many pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use jar technique in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about the way I would do it
in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a commercial grow, I'll chop the large
stalk and naked stems out of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and place the buds still on sticks into
large, rubber-made containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a big plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've lollipopped up probably 12 to 18
inches of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got some naked sticks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean by naked sticks,
the shaved legs and that main big stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll cut all of that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a commercial grow, that's actually got
to be weighed and documented as removed
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got two piles, one pile is
naked sticks that need to be documented as
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be chipped up and thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's another pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the usable product of the sticks
with buds up it that need to be trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those buds still on the sticks get put
into the rubber-made containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: untrimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully label your rubber-made
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not label the lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never label lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a facility, in a home grow,
don't label the lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lids are interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chop the sticks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the good usable buds into the
rubber-made container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't squish them in there too tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it up pretty well, but don't cram
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need some air space in there and you
don't want to smash anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's too tightly pressed together,
it'll get funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start to smell bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture will get trapped in there and
you'll start to get that stale ammonia
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to avoid with
proper drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would go through and remove all of
the sticks, get all the good buds into the
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they are all completed,
I would go through and put the lids on
[SPEAKER_01]: every container at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have everything labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd all be sitting open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we're done with every plant
that's going to get binned that day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I start putting the lids on
and sealing up the containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I feel like I haven't described these
containers properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: These rubber-made containers are like the
size of maybe a laundry basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about three feet wide,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe a foot or so wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I said wide, but three feet long
and a foot or so wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then probably about 18, maybe 20
inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the one that you use for packing
or you just put a bunch of clothes in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, just a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's the one when the kids come to the
front door and they're trying to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: candy for church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got some candy for church there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to raise some money?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got the big rubber-made
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the container I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a moving box or something
is what it looks like, a storage
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can fit three or four large plants in
those containers from the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I should have mentioned that a
little earlier, but it just dawned on me
[SPEAKER_01]: that I did not describe these containers
in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's talk more about what happens
to these plants once they are put into
[SPEAKER_01]: this container and the lid is put on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be opened and rotated every
day until they're dry enough to seal up
[SPEAKER_01]: without risking any mold development.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first day is always scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you seal them up and then leave
overnight, that is always a scary feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: until you get there the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to leave them open if you
feel like they're a little too moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cut them down and get them in the
bin and realize, ah shit, a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: these are too wet, don't be afraid to
leave those open overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would rather leave them open and get
them a little too dry than close them up
[SPEAKER_01]: and get them a little funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little funky doesn't go away,
a little too dry we can work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you seal them up, you put the lids on
them, and then you might want to check on
[SPEAKER_01]: them before you leave for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that nothing needs to be
rotated, nothing needs to be flipped
[SPEAKER_01]: around, nothing needs to be left open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if it needs to be left open,
leave it open, don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to leave, you're going
to come back the next day, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a bunch of sealed containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be popped open immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would pop them open for four,
maybe six, maybe seven hours and check on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: While they were sealed, a lot of the
moisture that was inside those sticks
[SPEAKER_01]: reconstituted throughout those buds and a
lot of moisture built up in that
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find a lot of spongy and
wet buds when you come in in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to leave it open and get some
of that shit out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to open it up every day and let
that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start getting dry again,
some of the sticks might not even snap
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them may have re-moistened to
where they don't snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you may have gone just a little
bit too early, but it's not bad because we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get that moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to get too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to pop them open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see how wet they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave them open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may just want to leave them open for
an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're real dry, an hour is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four to six hours is not uncommon on the
first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you chop those plants down or if you
bend those plants a little bit too early,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may be really wet and you may have to
leave them open for four to six,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the whole shift of eight to 10
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have to stay open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to cut them down and put them into
the bins so early next time, but you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something you're going to have to
dial in with your facility and with your
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the duration of burp time is going to
decrease slowly as the buds dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bins are going to sit in a room
ideally that is at 50% humidity and 70
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees until you have time to trim them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a humidifier and a dehumidifier at
the same time and they're both set at 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that room gets to 55% humidity,
that dehumidifier kicks on immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets to 45%, the humidifier comes on
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get out of that 10 degree range
and it stays pretty close with both of
[SPEAKER_01]: those machines and they're fighting each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pretty much just stay on all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got these buds, they are in
containers, they have not been trimmed yet
[SPEAKER_01]: and they still need to be burped on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing the dry and cure manager
or the trim team manager should do when
[SPEAKER_01]: they get to the grow is pop open these
bins and see what type of situation you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be getting drier and more
smokable and they should start smelling
[SPEAKER_01]: more like daint cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fresh green wet smell should be going
away, but you're going to have to pop them
[SPEAKER_01]: every day and pay attention to how long
they need to be opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, that first day, you're going
to get four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the second day, four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the third day, four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the fourth day, three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then maybe you're just going to have to
pop them open for an hour every day and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what's going on and check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, you won't have to open them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've gotten them to about 65%
humidity inside the container
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently, you don't have to burp it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is cured where you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also in that room with 50%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to stay about 50% humidity
and it won't get less than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the containers hold moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to stay above 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while you're drying and curing inside
those bins, be sure to burp the bins every
[SPEAKER_01]: day and rotate the buds to prevent mold
and funky aromas until they get dry enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to take the buds and pick
them up right outside of the container and
[SPEAKER_01]: flip them over and set it back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the buds that were on the bottom
are now on the top and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that once or twice a day if you
feel like you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are really wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I want to keep stressing is if
they are too moist, don't be afraid to
[SPEAKER_01]: leave the lid off the containers until the
buds are nice and dry and you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable closing them up and you're
sure there's not going to get any mold in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you leave it closed for too
long or you've been these buds too early,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to create an ammonia type
funky terrible smell inside your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to burn well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to smell funky and it's not
going to be desirable and you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to sell it at your dispensary
or however you plan on selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one problem you may run into if you
leave it closed too long is funky aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you can do to fix that is
try to air it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just leave it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to let that smell go away and it's
probably not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably gone too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure not to seal it up for too
long and make sure not to seal it up when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's too moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another problem you could run into during
the drying and curing process is the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: could get too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your buds get too dry in those
containers, a trick you can do is to go
[SPEAKER_01]: pull a few leaves from your growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a flower room, you probably
need to defoliate a little bit and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: some leaves off those flowering plants
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get, I would say four to six large
leaves per Rubbermaid container is more
[SPEAKER_01]: than enough to rehydrate some semi dry
buds in one of those containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to put too much in there and it
made it really wet really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four to six leaves is more than enough
to re-moisten an entire Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_01]: container if you left it open just a
little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got it down into that Colorado
crunch zone, then you've done fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: and you might not be able to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll talk about that a little bit
later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you didn't go too far, just grab
four or five, maybe six leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: throw them in the container and seal it up
for just a few hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then go check on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That moisture will reconstitute the buds
and give you a second chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not recommend using anything other
than cannabis leaves, maybe both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boveda packs, Boveda packs, however you
like to say it, the Boveda packs come at
[SPEAKER_01]: 62% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use those if you'd like,
although I do not prefer them myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they make a weird flavor in my
cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that using the leaves of the same
plant is the best idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that is basically the
commercial grow version of drying and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing your cannabis plants on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to take a giant dab and when
we get back, we will talk about drying and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing your cannabis on a smaller scale
for the home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world, let's get back
into this dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home grow or the connoisseur version
of drying and curing your final product is
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit different than the commercial
grow version, but it's basically the same
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to slow down the drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get those buds to feel nice and
sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to smell nice and sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to burn nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how I would dry and cure my
product in a small connoisseur batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a smaller grow, a home grow or a
boutique grow, or maybe something I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to enter into a competition,
if this was going into a cup, this is how
[SPEAKER_01]: I would cure my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference is that I would not be
using the gigantic Rubbermaid containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use quart size wide mouth glass
jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to use bigger jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like maybe too much moisture gets
stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the same conditions that you
create in those Rubbermaid containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the smaller, more focused jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another note before we get too far,
make sure you label each jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with more than one
strain, label the jars, not the lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lids are interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with this, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with different
phenotypes, label the jar whatever Arise
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenotype 2, Arise Phenotype 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running a pack of seeds or
whatever, label the jars so that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically everything up to the point of
the sticks snapping is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for the sticks to snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the sticks snap, that's when we can
start the jar curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: For jar tech, I would take the snappy
sticks and chop off every bud into a
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get all those buds off the sticks,
into the bucket, throw those sticks away,
[SPEAKER_01]: get rid of them, do whatever you do with
them, compost them, shred them up,
[SPEAKER_01]: toss them, those are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I hand trim the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do another episode all about hand
trimming the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like trim machines and I don't
like wet trim, but I'll talk about that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the trimming episode that is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I trim the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be dry enough by now to knock
off most of the leaves with your thumbs
[SPEAKER_01]: and thumbnails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trim them up pretty closely with your
thumb, then put the trimmed buds into the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass jars that we talked about,
the wide mouth quart size mason jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill those jars about 75 to 90% full.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your buds are fluffier, if your buds
are bigger, you're only gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get 75% in there because of all the air
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got smaller buds, you can put up
to 90% in there, but do not press them
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the jar and don't overpack them
and don't squish them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want them lightly sitting in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once the jar is full, I add the lid
and I set a timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to check my buds about four hours
after being sealed up for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This first check lets me see how much
moisture is trapped in my buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the inside of the jar is extremely
humid, I'll just leave that lid off for an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the commercial grow, we were talking
about four to six, maybe eight hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are much larger plants, much larger
batches, and much larger containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is much more moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for these smaller jars, I only wanna
leave it off for a little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These smaller batches can get away from
you quite quickly, so pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So open it up, see how humid it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's really humid and really squishy,
you're gonna wanna leave it open for an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour, maybe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep checking on it and do not forget
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set another timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the humidity has not made the buds
squishy again, I'll leave the jar open for
[SPEAKER_01]: only like 15 to 30 minutes to let the
moisture out and that old funky air out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar and then it'll kinda refresh with
fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll reseal the jar and let it sit
for another four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set a timer for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in four to six hours, I pop that jar
and I gently stir the buds around and
[SPEAKER_01]: check the aroma that comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm looking for when I smell is an
aroma of ammonia or funk or just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll notice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nose will crinkle up and your eyes
will make a weird squint and you'll go,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for that aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that's not present.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm looking to see if it smells less
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it gone from that wet, juicy hay smell
to more of that cured, chronic,
[SPEAKER_01]: smell that I'm looking for because it'll
start doing it quickly and then it will
[SPEAKER_01]: improve over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm cracking the jar open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking to see how much humidity is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stir them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the buds seem damp or extra spongy,
at this point, I'll dump them out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: jar and let them sit for a few minutes
until that excess moisture evaporates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the buds super soggy and
sealed in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the buds super wet and
pressed together in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they still feel wet and spongy on the
outside, I'll dump them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them sit out for a few minutes until
they feel dry on the outside, but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: squeeze them, they're mushy still a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want them dry on the outside,
wet on the inside is what you're going for
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the buds are sticking together,
then I dump them out completely and let
[SPEAKER_01]: them dry more before putting them back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we want a little bit of moisture in
these buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little bit of moisture is going to
make the drying and curing process happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't want enough moisture to cause
mold and funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we burp the jar about every four hours
to make sure we don't seal too much water
[SPEAKER_01]: in the jar for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let some of the curing process happen
by opening the jar, letting that old gas
[SPEAKER_01]: out that contains the chlorophyll,
that contains the sugars, that gas
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporates out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We replace it with fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we seal it, it's allowed to
restart the curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start deteriorating and eating up
more of that chlorophyll, more of those
[SPEAKER_01]: excess minerals and sugars inside of
there, and they will start evaporating out
[SPEAKER_01]: of your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the first couple of days,
you can slowly increase your burp
[SPEAKER_01]: intervals as the buds get drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may only need to open these jars up
every six to eight hours after a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, and the time that you leave them open
will also decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe after a few days, you pop it open
every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you pop it open right before you go
to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You leave it open while you're brushing
your teeth and getting your shoes on,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you close it up and you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come back from work and then you pop
it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably been 10 hours by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop it open again, stir the buds around,
make sure nothing's gone funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If nothing's gone funky, just leave it
open for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that air exchange in there,
seal it right back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can go 10 hours and you know
you're safe at 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens at 11 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens at 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start stretching it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of two weeks, you'll just be
popping these jars open once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll check it out, you'll give it a good
smell, and you'll say, that is so close,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you can close it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of two weeks, these buds will
be beautifully, beautifully cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bud should be sticky on the
outside, and spongy, but not dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: crumbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should almost have a little bit of
squeeze, a little bit of give to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then stick to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't fall apart and just crumble
up like a lot of the Colorado dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: bud does, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that, you guys,
is because it's sitting on the shelf out
[SPEAKER_01]: there all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're opening up those jars and showing
it to you all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff is just getting dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the problem with the Colorado
Crunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers work hard to get it proper,
and then it's sent to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: left in those jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bud tenders don't do us justice,
so I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on day one, I chop the buds off the
sticks, and I trim them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I fill the jars about 90% full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I seal the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check the jar in about four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I open it long enough for the excess
moisture to come out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on how wet the buds
were when you jarred them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I check it again in about four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shuffle the buds if I feel that's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's likely necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I check again in four to six hours
and leave open as necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're getting too sticky again,
I'll dump them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll want to check as soon as you wake
up the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The burp process will slow down over the
next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to take as long as possible
without allowing mildew to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer it takes, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more time that it takes for that
moisture to come out, the more opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: you have for chlorophyll to be removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing to worry about,
very similarly to the Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_01]: technique, is trapping too much moisture
in your containers for too long and
[SPEAKER_01]: causing yourself mildew or funky flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you locked your buds up in these jars
long enough to where you got like white
[SPEAKER_01]: moldy webbing growing on there and it
looks like some cotton coming out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you fucked up and didn't pay any
attention, throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your jar is starting to get an ammonia
smell, you've sealed it up too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to open it more frequently and
longer next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to save it, but it's
unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you can do is leave it open
and let it dry out and hopefully that
[SPEAKER_01]: smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't leave it closed too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let mildew happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let that funky smell happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're past the first few days,
you'll kind of be out of the mildew danger
[SPEAKER_01]: zone, but still be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also keep your jars in a cool dark place
while you're curing your buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also don't leave them somewhere where
you're going to forget about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also here in Colorado, I'm running a swamp
cooler in the main portion, the living
[SPEAKER_01]: area of my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go dump your buds on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Near the swamp cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to do you any good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to reconstitute them and
make them wetter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about wetter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, think about the environment where
you were drying and curing your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to dump them out on the
table and an attempt to get them more dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that the room is drier than the
bud or it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep that kind of stuff in mind,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like we've got a basic
understanding of how to cure our buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get into the technical talk
about why we do it and what's technically
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So curing your buds properly makes your
buds burn and smoke smoothly and it also
[SPEAKER_01]: brings out the best flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper drying and curing will also
increase your potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your buds contain chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chlorophyll is what gives your buds that
harsh smoke and hay-like flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: that burn your throat kind of funky
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from too much chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from excess minerals in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could also be from an improper flush,
but it's usually from an improper cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So curing the buds will remove chlorophyll
and increase your potency at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to remove chlorophyll is by
turning it into a gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sealing our moist buds in a jar creates an
environment that will break down the
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll and turn it into a gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Darkness, moisture, and oxygen will create
a bacteria within the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bacteria will break down the sugars
and leftover minerals created by the
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition of the chlorophyll and it
will turn into a vapor that can escape the
[SPEAKER_01]: jar when you pop it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what I was talking about earlier
when I said we pop open the jar and let
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemical reaction happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this process is going to make your bud
burn smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to bring out the proper aromas,
the proper terpene profile that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for, and it's also going to
increase the overall potency of your
[SPEAKER_01]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you really want to start out and
dial this in and create a connoisseur
[SPEAKER_01]: product, find yourself a hygrometer that
fits inside of your mason jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple available that fit
right inside the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can press it up to the front of the
jar to where you can read the display
[SPEAKER_01]: without opening the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find yourself hygrometers that will fit in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are some suggestions on when to
open and close your jars and how to dial
[SPEAKER_01]: them in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your buds feel wet or if they are above
70% humidity, if the little display on
[SPEAKER_01]: that hygrometer inside of your jar reads
above 70% humidity, you need to dump those
[SPEAKER_01]: buds out of the jar and let them dry until
they get to 65 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you dump them out and you leave
them somewhere that's not by the fan,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not by the swamp cooler,
that's not by the air conditioner,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not by something that's going to
drastically affect the rate of their
[SPEAKER_01]: drying, don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set a timer and go find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you are a little obsessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not going to forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you are going to take a couple of
dabs and go play Fortnite and your buds
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to dry up to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let that happen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they are too humid, dump them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them dry out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them down to 65 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if your buds feel moist to the touch,
if they're sticky and wet to the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the buds and the display reads 65 to
70% humidity, pop the lid off of that jar
[SPEAKER_01]: for 15 to 30 minutes and let a little
moisture evaporate out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think they need longer than 15 to
30 minutes, let them go longer but like I
[SPEAKER_01]: said, don't start playing Fortnite and
start building shit and shooting people
[SPEAKER_01]: and forget about them because you don't
want them to get too crunchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 15 to 30, maybe 45 minutes,
maybe an hour, seal them back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set yourself a timer to remember to check
on them in a little bit and now you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: play Fortnite and relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your goal is 60 to 65% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that hygrometer to read between
60 and 65% humidity and you want them dry
[SPEAKER_01]: but not crunchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to feel squishy and sticky
hopefully but they're not wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want them dry but not crunchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need to let your buds sit out
for a little bit before you roll a joint
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's cured perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The display will say 60 to 65%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to take a couple of buds out
of there and set them, I just set them
[SPEAKER_01]: right here on the front of my computer if
I'm going to roll one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little warmer right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let them chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not like in the path of the fan or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let them chill right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to roll a joint with
in a few minutes and just let them sit
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, just for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just maybe if I'm going to go to lunch and
come back and smoke a joint, I'll set them
[SPEAKER_01]: out right before I go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to lunch and then you come
back and then they grind up nice and fine
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're still sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still juicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your joint burns super smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your joints not burning super
smooth, then you probably have too much
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in there and you got to let it
dry and cure just a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you hit that 55% or lower mark,
you're entering what I call the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch area and your buds are going to
burn too fast and you're also losing
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with more than a quarter
pound there and you're drying it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you risk losing, you know, a quarter of an
ounce or whatever, depends on how much you
[SPEAKER_01]: let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your buds get too dry, don't add
anything funky to rehydrate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I would use are fresh
cannabis leaves and a little bit goes a
[SPEAKER_01]: long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take them out when the moisture comes
back and don't let those leaves mold up in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and fuck up your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check on them frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put wet leaves inside of either
your curing jars or your packs or your
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking turkey bags, however you do it,
make sure you take them out and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: leave them for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check on them after an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hour is more than enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set yourself a timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get stuck doing an Instagram live
video and forget to check on your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to take a little bit for
your hygrometer to measure the humidity in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar, but it's going to get you a
pretty good idea of when to open and close
[SPEAKER_01]: those jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to give you some actual
data to go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to squeeze those buds and
feel how wet they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be able to compare that number
or that moisture to the number on the
[SPEAKER_01]: hygrometer and you'll go, oh, that's what
65% feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Jeff's trying to get me to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives you something to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a cheater,
but if you're using one hygrometer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to seal it into the
jar for a few minutes and wait for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if it's jumping real fast,
go ahead and pull it out, leave that jar
[SPEAKER_01]: open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means it's really humid in there and
that you're just going to seal it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a little tiny hygrometer in
our jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're watching the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get ourselves to 60 to 65%
humidity inside of those jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you don't forget about your
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you don't get that funky aroma
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it doesn't smell like ammonia
and mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you don't ruin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be paying attention to the
number on the hygrometer and then pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: some buds out and seeing what they feel
like so that you know what 50,
[SPEAKER_01]: what 60, what 70, what 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get to 80, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so that you know what the percentage
of humidity feels like inside these jars
[SPEAKER_01]: with the bud feels like, this will give
you a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start paying attention to that stuff and
you will get ahead of the drying and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once you've gotten your buds dried
and cured to 55 to 65% humidity and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see any fluctuation inside that jar
on the hygrometer, you only need to crack
[SPEAKER_01]: them open to check on them or pull out
some buds to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to keep popping those jars
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get too dry if you do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can trap the moisture in there,
leave it right at that point and your bud
[SPEAKER_01]: will be perfectly cured for whenever you
need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've said before that I don't like
the Boveda packs, but they work if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Boveda packs I would buy are the 62%
and you can just drop them right inside
[SPEAKER_01]: your jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help reconstitute that package or
that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes I feel like they leave
kind of a watery flavor on the buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I guess I'd rather have a properly
cured bud that has that aroma than some
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado crunch that's just going to burn
up when I light my joint at the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ladies and gentlemen, that is my dry
and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions, please send them to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to continue the conversation

[SPEAKER_01]: Also, this is a good time for me to
recommend my Patreon campaign.

efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks, if you feel like you had
[SPEAKER_01]: some fun, if you feel like you learned
something, I would encourage you to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: patreon.com slash grow from your heart and

[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people who would like to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that feel like they can
help out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate that help.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do with that funding is I pay for
my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually bought a MacBook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to pay for the MacBook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually buy these little microphone
covers so that when Granny and Giddy are
[SPEAKER_01]: on, they don't have to spit into these
same microphone covers over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are things like that that do need
to be covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know that it's an option,
you don't know how you can help out.

helped out with the Patreon campaign.
