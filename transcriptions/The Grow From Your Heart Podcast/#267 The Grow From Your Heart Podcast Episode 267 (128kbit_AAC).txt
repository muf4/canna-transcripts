listening to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_16]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Thursday, and that means it's time
for another Throwback Thursday episode of
[SPEAKER_08]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions, or any
[SPEAKER_08]: contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no advertisements, promotions,
giveaways, or contests that are valid in
[SPEAKER_08]: these old episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys for listening,
and with no further ado, here's a block of
[SPEAKER_08]: old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_08]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_08]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_08]: for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_08]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode
features myself and our buddy White Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you follow White Mike's Facebook
page, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you support all the sensible
cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys, I don't want to do too long of
an intro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to let the music play.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get right back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be joined by our good friend White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's how the podcast is going to
start is with a big fat blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys, we are back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to save the studio.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can this officially be a studio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when all the gear is out,
we can call it a studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: So today we've got the pocket studio.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're recording on the ... My mouth is
fucking high.
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain's not as high as my mouth,
I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're recording on the Zoom H6 Handy
recorder, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing a little test run.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure that I've got this
figured out because I'm going to go record
[SPEAKER_08]: with Dad and Granny again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here on the podcast with me in the
makeshift pocket studio is our buddy White
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do this part that I always like to
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell everybody that's listening where they
can stalk you on social media so that they
[SPEAKER_08]: can check you out while they're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
Facebook and at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of stuff are we going to see if
we go to the Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: laws Facebook page?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much any marijuana news related
event I can find that's even remotely
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant to the US gets linked up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate what you do for the cannabis
industry and for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a working man and I'm always at a
grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody that listens to the podcast
regularly knows that I am the lead
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivator of a hundred light facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that keeps me busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a day job.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the politics happens during the
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when there's politicking to be done,
when there's people have to go to city
[SPEAKER_08]: council meetings and speak and show
support when that stuff is to be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike is the guy that goes and does that in
my my place because I am stuck at the
[SPEAKER_08]: grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks for doing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having a Facebook page to keep
our community together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to all the people that help with
Mike Mike's organizations and all the
[SPEAKER_08]: people that join up with Mike to go to all
these rallies to go protest things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to all those people.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are a couple of pro what's the
word activists in town?
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't think of the word activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of nice that I'm not totally
alone anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to give two or three of them
some shout outs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody that may deserve a big fat thumbs
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Juicy J has been doing a lot of stuff on
social media that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy named Brooks that's been
doing a ton of stuff on social media right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great infographic memes for our
side and our fight down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing some amazing work and I
really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his work shared to Mike on my
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got record views and shares and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Juicy J and Brooks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to those two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for supporting the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need people like you on the team.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, dude, awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: You showed up with this orange flavory
citrusy grapefruit hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Clementine Sugar Wax from Rockin'
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new Pueblo company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it to something fun to take along
with me to a meeting with several dab kids
[SPEAKER_00]: is the wrong term, but it's the closest
one we got, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several folks getting together dabbing and
it ended up being the talk of the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I thought was funny because we were
dabbing raw turps on distillate that night
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this a live resin or is this a fresh
frozen product?
[SPEAKER_08]: How much do you know about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually not sure on that particular
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big part or the big pitch of this
company is it's a proprietary mixed gas
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: That explains a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody that knows a lot, not a lot,
but that smokes a lot of different types
[SPEAKER_08]: of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell that that's why I asked if it
was live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the color and texture.
[SPEAKER_08]: The color and texture are not what I'm
used to seeing from a butane extraction
[SPEAKER_08]: unless it's live resin, but that is very,
very close to what I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you call that color?
[SPEAKER_08]: Man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what color that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Butterscotch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a butterscotch color.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really good description of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not orange, it's not yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was fresh, it had a little more
orange, yellowish pop to it, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: propane-butane mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the propane happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is legitimately the first propane
hash I've ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great Vice Media documentary
where they go and interview a guy building
[SPEAKER_00]: a propane extraction rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash that comes out of that is like
frighteningly orange, like cheese and
[SPEAKER_00]: orange.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've smoked a bunch of propane hash oil
from our friends at Altitude Organic
[SPEAKER_08]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've smoked a bunch of propane hash from
Altitude and it's always white,
[SPEAKER_08]: completely white.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of mushy and it always tastes
really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I don't like about it is it kind of
makes my lungs feel sort of heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives me a butter lung sort of feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I over dabbed myself with some of this one
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I way overheated my banger and took an
insanely hot dab, just not paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one I'd taken a little cool,
so I was a little... Trying to make up for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was coughing, the cough seemed to
go on quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a minute I considered, is it the mixed
gas?
[SPEAKER_00]: But from everything I've seen,
all the lab testing, it's totally clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about lipids and plant fats and
all that kind of stuff on an episode
[SPEAKER_08]: previous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if there are plant paraffins and
lipids and stuff like that left behind in
[SPEAKER_08]: there that they're not taken out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, it's marvelous hash is what I
wanted to get to.
[SPEAKER_08]: The flavor is insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: At first it was like orangey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I waited a few minutes and as my
mouth dried up, it turned to grapefruits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just straight up grapefruits on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want to take a drink for a while,
but I had to because I was coughing and
dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got the grapefruit coating now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job on bringing the good hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to Rockin' Extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said they're a Pueblo company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right up the street from the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good guys, they make several different
products that I'm enjoying right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their deliveries better always be on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do that legally with the manifest?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you walk over a product?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it a couple of different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got the first vape pen
cartridge I've actually not felt bad about
[SPEAKER_00]: spending money on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it come in flavors or is it just one
flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's just a single extract run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixed batch, no strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa or indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hybrid blend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means they just threw a bunch of shit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling it's half Clementine,
half Blue Dream is honestly what I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've been enjoying the hell out
of the Sugar Wax.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super tasty hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: High quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys go into your local weed
store, if that's the thing where you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: ask them what new stuff is in and check
out new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get set in a total routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new cool stuff coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's new?
[SPEAKER_08]: I stepped out of my little box.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really familiar with Turpex.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grow the product at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We take it to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_08]: They turn it into concentrates for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why wouldn't I buy that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: But lately I've been buying the Kraft
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Kraft makes really good products.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been getting Extracts Ink.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what they're called.
[SPEAKER_08]: Extracts Ink.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they make really good products.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had some Darth Cookies the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've been stepping out of my normal
710 Labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Viola.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you get the right batch of
Viola, it'll taste really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out new shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be afraid to try new stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd spend a lot of time going through the
edible section, making sure I tried kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of one of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing the same thing with the hash
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun watching you step up your hash
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive piece by piece,
but I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You started off, I think I gave you your
first dab probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was downstairs on the swing arm
skillet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in those days, the hot oil days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The syringe of black CO2 oil on the
dabber, on the dental pick dabber days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, those days when they were selling us
dental pick dabbers at the events for like
[SPEAKER_08]: the price of dab tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were just old dental dabbers from
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but it's good to see you stepped up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You went from taking little tiny dabs of
just booboo to now you take pretty good
[SPEAKER_08]: sized dabs of some Clementine sugar wax,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got you a decent sized dab of some
pineapple jack set up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to make you cough pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last pineapple jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which company made this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Terp?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from the Terp X.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shop got in a shipment of that a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up with like eight of them at
home by the time we sold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a backstache.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably grew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really great strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's actually New York pineapple
diesel is what it would be.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pineapple diesel cross on accident,
I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there were a bunch of seeds and that's
what came out as that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it grows like a fucking savage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great, it's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been talking for quite a while
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've gotten in the,
any sort of topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I take this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let the listeners know what the
topics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the first topic, I'm going to read a
couple of email, maybe, maybe two depends
[SPEAKER_08]: on how long we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read one email.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should find my phone because it's on
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to remind everybody that I did
promise everybody a podcast about the dab
[SPEAKER_08]: and granny or with featuring the dab and
granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I recorded that podcast at the Canna
Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately I got home and my memory
card would not let me pull the files.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would let me drag the files from the
memory card to my desktop, but they will
[SPEAKER_08]: not play.
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't play from the memory card.
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't play from the desktop.
[SPEAKER_08]: I even took the zoom H six and ran the USB
cable to the computer and tried to open
[SPEAKER_08]: the files that way and use it as a file
reader.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will not do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So far with my tech skills that that shows
lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I've done is I set up another
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm not going to tell you when,
cause you might show up.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's creepy, but in the future,
dab and granny, myself, Brett,
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay, and maybe a couple of the folks
are going to congregate at the Canna
[SPEAKER_08]: Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike is going to cough his face off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang out, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to run, do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll leave your mic on and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's tomato red, turning purple again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but we're going to record the dab and
granny podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: So stick around.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be coming up in the, in the very
near future.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we're going to read that email.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said that the one thing I want to talk
about with Mike, the main thing,
[SPEAKER_08]: cause Mike is our smart friend that comes
over with smart shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the DEA has
failed to reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, cannabis is still considered a
schedule one drug, which, uh, let me,
[SPEAKER_08]: let me tell you what that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means schedule one drugs are the most
dangerous drugs with the most potential
[SPEAKER_08]: for abuse and psychological dependence.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now cannabis still is in the same
category as LSD, as heroin and ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it coming a mile away, but I'm still
a little disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: So about 90 days ago, the DEA said that
they were considering rescheduling
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: They taunted everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: They teased us.
[SPEAKER_08]: They made us all think that there may be a
change.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in 90 days, they just said,
Oh, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a change and it is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not as big as the media made it
sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they didn't reschedule cannabis,
but they did open up, um, more research,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, gross production sites for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for pretty much everybody listening
this whole lifetime, the feds have been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: For research purposes at the university of
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still dabbed out, but, um,
uh, that's the only farm that grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've been watching Sanjay Gupta's
weed one, two, and three specials on CNN,
[SPEAKER_00]: they covered the research restriction,
uh, topic pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, uh, there's only one farm
growing research marijuana in the U S
[SPEAKER_00]: which means there's almost no variety of
cannabis to research in the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only got four strains or some
really restricted numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs are still going a little nuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can hear it, but you're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're saying you're making enough sense
to make it matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are following along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying really hard not to cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch it right into the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing really well too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should see the look on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis makes you dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just stoned.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys that, uh, that cannabis,
I've seen the cannabis that they grow at
[SPEAKER_08]: that facility there in Mississippi and
it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have a proper grow facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have proper technique.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they have good genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen what they're doing and it isn't,
it's an embarrassing growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: My grow looked like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would put matches to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be ashamed of what they were
producing when I saw the last footage in
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you can pull up some footage on
YouTube, what a lot of it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you listen to the researchers
talk, they tell you, well, we can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's requested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can mix a batch of 19% THC or 10% or 4%
or 12%, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at what he's talking
about, he's basically like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just grind up enough leaf and stem in
there to bring the 21 down to 12 or the
[SPEAKER_00]: grind enough bud over the 4% until it's a
9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, yeah, it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen their facility and I don't think
they ever passed 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds have run a medical marijuana
program since 82 where patients get mailed
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 ounces each of pre-rolled joints every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a coffee can, like a really cool
coffee tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a bizarre collectible in
the U S now, cause you can find them on
[SPEAKER_00]: eBay from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the federal patients that does
a lot of public speaking will give them
[SPEAKER_00]: away for a charity events like silent
auctions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the marijuana that those patients get
is from this farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the video of it, especially
that was taken at like conferences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late nineties, early thousands,
the quality is just atrocious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have to unroll the pre-rolled
joints, rehydrated in the fridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: like old hippie style with a piece of
lettuce or a piece of bread to bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content up real quick and then
reroll it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Mexican brickweed from America.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they, yeah, they need to hire
somebody that, Hey guys in Mississippi
[SPEAKER_08]: hire me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten a lot better since a lot of
that footage was shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see the CNN footage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know it well enough to discuss
quality from that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the footage that I saw.
[SPEAKER_08]: They walk into the room with like,
it looks like a shitty led and they've got
[SPEAKER_08]: like a small hydro table and the plants
just look sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the plants totally look sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's definitely not like a Colorado
commercial production quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not homegrown quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the guy we went to his house and
he had those super stretchy plants with
[SPEAKER_08]: the UFO light above them.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it made me think of.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm talking about right
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminded me of that dude's grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Oh, that guy's growing over
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some struggle buds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they can't be very struggle,
but it can be very, very good quality by
[SPEAKER_08]: the looks of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there, the DEA claims that cannabis
does not have a, uh, a currently accepted
[SPEAKER_08]: medical use in the U S and there is a lack
of accepted safety for its use under
[SPEAKER_08]: medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a high potential for abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, all of that is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, what, why aren't, why aren't
Mike, why isn't the DEA smart enough to
[SPEAKER_08]: see that all of that is bullshit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they totally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's their, what's their motive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have anything to do with
marijuana itself and everything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: succeeding power.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, um, marijuana being illegal
is an amazingly powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does several things that they want to
keep happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if they lose that stick, they lose a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are a lot of things that are
built on that pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crumble after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the pharmaceutical industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are definitely financial
interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the prison, is it the prison
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's been some good reporting
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Washington or I don't remember which
paper, but, uh, looking at the major
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying efforts recently against
marijuana rescheduling against marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that's coming from alcohol
and pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alcohol, pharmaceutical prisons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, there's a big report out
recently that legal marijuana states and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana states, uh, huge
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Medicare and Medicaid prescription
billing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was in enough States and over
the same timelines to draw causation
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not a one-to-one like mathematical,
um, conclusion, but enough to infer that
[SPEAKER_00]: where people have easy, free legal access
to cannabis, um, they can just swing by a
[SPEAKER_00]: store and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they consume significantly less
prescription drugs and that's a huge loss
[SPEAKER_00]: to a major industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when 20 something males have,
uh, marijuana that they can go buy at a
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they consume significantly less
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, my mic sounded really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, honestly, when, uh, I got my first
medical marijuana card, I told myself and
[SPEAKER_08]: my friends and my family, I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can smoke all the cannabis I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here it is probably six, seven,
eight years, maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't drank since I started using
medical cannabis since I was able to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: the dispensary and point at that jar and
say, let me get an ounce of that tastiness
[SPEAKER_08]: right there and go home and roll up and
puff down as hard as I want without any
[SPEAKER_08]: worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause back in the day, I didn't know where
I was going to buy my next weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to preserve that ounce cause you
paid way too much and you don't know if
[SPEAKER_08]: that dude's going to have good weed or not
next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can medicate as needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to drink any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like being drunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm no good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I'm really good at it or
really bad at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what the case is,
but I know that it's not my friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't wake up hung over and regretful
when I smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very similar story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, I quit drinking before I had a
medical marijuana card, but essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing is I got really good at
drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided that I didn't like some of
those character traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to take a couple of days
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of days became a week and now
it's been like eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Mardi Gras two years ago and had
three beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just like with dinners, just because
I was there and I was at sea level and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't feel the repercussions of it the
next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wouldn't have had, I had up three
beers here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that where Davey happened, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out about Davey the day after we
got to New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so the wife couldn't have any alcohol
the whole time on the trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of how we found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day we got there, she took a sip out
her first drink and got queasy and was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, man, and then the second day,
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the second day she was like,
go to Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were in New Orleans for 10 days
and we found out we were, we were pregnant
[SPEAKER_00]: on the second day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get to celebrate while you're
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We celebrated the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a truckload of good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of us are real heavy drinkers
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like we're missing out on
anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I had a great time and I had a
lot to celebrate, but yes, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it has to do with,
I can relax and unwind with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a much better unwind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's no penalty the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I hated about drinking is
the incredibly bad decisions I would make
[SPEAKER_00]: while drinking and then waking up the next
day, getting home while you're drunk,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just figuring out how to get home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I going to drive?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I going to take a taxi?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I going to jump in one of my drunk
friend's cars?
[SPEAKER_08]: So many nights, so many, so many mornings
I've woken up saying, I am so thankful
[SPEAKER_08]: that I made it home last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to someone today who's like,
I quit drinking this morning and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I hear it a lot when you get to six
months holler.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the point we're at here is people are
consuming less cannabis or consuming less
[SPEAKER_08]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're consuming less pills because we
are able to access cannabis safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's, there's a lot of people who
don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people who don't want
to lose that lever of control on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an immediate excuse to get to further
a car stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's not one video on YouTube
where the cop goes, I smell heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke cocaine or I smell
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That video doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never gets said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I smell a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I smell someone you're smuggling
in your trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That video doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is I think I smell marijuana when that
steps away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is so true because I recently got
pulled over.
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first thing that cop said was,
do you have any marijuana in the vehicle?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had to reprogram my brain real
quickly because first I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: no, sir, there's no weed in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I was like, wait a minute,
that's 2016, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got your badge on, you've got your
purple card in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I looked him straight in the face and
I go, it may be because I wasn't certain,
[SPEAKER_08]: but there may be, there could be weed in
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, it's smells really strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, oh, I work at a grow and
just being honest with him, that changed
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had no problem to mess with me now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That does take all the stress.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a criminal anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing I used to do wrong was have
a bunch of weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those first couple of law enforcement
interactions are bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a genetic response with this
community at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we admit to being part of the
cannabis community or having cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting it in any way, we subject
ourselves to all sorts of horrible things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colorado, that's not true anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as those realization sets in,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you been to an event or a place where
you have consumed cannabis near law
[SPEAKER_08]: enforcement and they've watched you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up in Denver in Boulder during the
heydays of the Boulder smoke out on 420 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the civic center gatherings on 420 where
tens or hundreds of thousands of people
[SPEAKER_00]: get together all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody lights up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of as a dare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 10,000 of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rest 11 of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're going to peacefully sit here
and smoke pot and play bad music and then
[SPEAKER_00]: cheer at 420 and all smoke pot together
and there'll be a big cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by five o'clock we'll all be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shops in the area that sell food will
all make an extra five grand, 10 grand
[SPEAKER_00]: that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody except people that have to take
public transportation or commute during
[SPEAKER_00]: those hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but Uber drivers are making mad
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred thousand people just convened at
civic center.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops stand by and they always had and
just kind of made sure everything was calm
[SPEAKER_00]: and collected and nobody got out of
control and it was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at post legalization, only a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I've been too busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always end up working those days.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not the guy that goes to all the
events.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not that dude there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I desperately want to go to like the next
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get out and enjoy a few events
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: August 27th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that Davey's a little bit older,
I can start doing that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to be so much fun pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I remember the first time we used to go
to smoke nights at the cloud nine hookah
[SPEAKER_08]: bar here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've talked about them on the podcast way
back in the early episodes because that
[SPEAKER_08]: was back in the, in the day here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, since then they've shut them down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't do that here in Pueblo anymore,
but we were at the cloud nine hookah bar
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was sitting, I was at the bar,
which is it's an old bar, but it's now
[SPEAKER_08]: turned into a hookah bar, but they didn't
change much.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's still got the bar seating.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just put hookahs out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was sitting at the bar and there was one
person and then me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in front of me is my little oil slick
pad, my rig, my torch, my little variety
[SPEAKER_08]: of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hitting the bar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a bowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in a bowl that night.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a bowl, some flowers in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a bag of weed next to me and I was
just chilling, just sitting on the bar
[SPEAKER_08]: stool and the cops walked in three of them
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I heard the radio.
[SPEAKER_08]: You always hear the, and then they walk in
and I was like, ah, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, we fucking sit here,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a 21 year old.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're over 21.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got a red card in your pocket,
a purple card.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: The owner of this place is who's going to
have to fucking deal with anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those cops walked right past me and they
went and talked to the owner.
[SPEAKER_08]: The owner nodded and smiled a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all shook hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cops walked past me and they kind of
looked at my, uh, what I had sitting on
[SPEAKER_08]: the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they looked at it more curiously.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were like, huh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what smoking hash supplies look
like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they walked past it and they nodded at
me and they kind of smiled like,
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what's up stoner?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like one of them kind of condescendingly
smile.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: You weed head, your high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other two just kind of nodded
politely.
[SPEAKER_08]: They walked out.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the kids that was there was a
younger dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, just, just being a typical dude,
I probably would have said the same thing
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking 15 years ago, but as soon as they
got outside, he goes, man, fuck the
[SPEAKER_08]: police.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I looked at him and I was like,
bro, unfuck those police.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't take my hash and we didn't go
to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you were the first motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_08]: They saw when they walked in here,
like they didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it was like, I had to remind him
like, we didn't go to jail for that dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like two years ago, they would have threw
me on the floor, like just for having that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are, there are a lot of people
who don't want to give that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you see things like the DEA
make decisions like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's just silly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is silly.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they, uh, if they would have
rescheduled cannabis to a schedule two
[SPEAKER_08]: substance, what that would have mean,
what that would have meant is it would
[SPEAKER_08]: have now been a allowable for
prescriptions by all medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'd be able to write you a
prescription for cannabis basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and they'd also, it makes research
significantly easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I hate to keep going back to
CNN specials cause CNN is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: obnoxious as all hell, but their marijuana
reporting that they've done has been
[SPEAKER_00]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's easy to research cocaine in the U
S because it's a schedule two drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to, it's easy to research
schedule two drugs because, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: their schedule two, if they're schedule
one, significantly more red tape,
[SPEAKER_00]: much, much harder to research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, I mean, it takes years of going
through approval meetings and submitting
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork years to just begin your study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then in studies take years to
complete, they take more years to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to write the conclusions, examine the
data, all of that, and then more years to
[SPEAKER_00]: publish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you add another decade of red
tape at the beginning of all that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana research is something that's not
going to happen until we're old men.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's because it's a schedule
one drug and, uh, moving it to schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: two changes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, any competent researcher can submit
the paperwork and within a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable amount of time, begin
researching and none of those changes were
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though they created more
places to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the selection of research grade
cannabis that's available to be researched
[SPEAKER_00]: will be expanding, uh, access to that
material won't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I, I, I rant and tell
people to vote because none of this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: changes until a, most of the people
involved in this have gotten old and died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we just have to wait until the
generation that's so tied to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, has seceded power to our generation
and it's just going to take another couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in the meantime, we need more
people in our generation politically
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many members of our community tuned out
because if we spoke up about what we
[SPEAKER_00]: believed in, we went to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was scared, dude, back in the day,
you would be like, come to these little
[SPEAKER_08]: city council meetings with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, no, I grow and that I'm
scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's part of the reason I
became the politically active one down
[SPEAKER_00]: here is because I didn't physically have
the space to grow, um, or the money for
[SPEAKER_00]: the startup equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't like go ahead and show up
in my house with a warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to search all 12 square feet,
start with the dirty laundry prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I could have cops show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have cops pull me over and demand
to search my car and I'd be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, most of the time, but, uh,
I w I was able to risk it where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other people in the community simply
weren't in a position to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but one of the, one of the really
interesting things that I noticed when I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke out is that it gives you a shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you go to city council meeting,
reporters for the local paper are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a major city, reporters for
major papers are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when the guy that comes down to city
council or the county commissioner
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings, it makes really coherent
articulate arguments, um, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And setting for marijuana gets his house
raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break a bunch of furniture,
rough him up, shoot his dog and don't find
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit makes the front page of the
Washington post every day for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's not universally true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being granted immunity by a
judge, but it does provide you a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant layer of protection because by
becoming mildly public, um, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're granted some of that protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the DEA failed you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was my point in that topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to move on to another topic here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, thanks for having a whole lot of
info on that one for supporting me on that
[SPEAKER_08]: one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Y 'all just learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I rambled a lot, but you like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Both, both happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it is now Wednesday, August 17th as we
were recording this at just past midnight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, right now it is August 17th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday, Gibbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gibbs, I don't know if you listen to this
podcast, bro, I love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great being your friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish you would hang out more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everything is going well for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy fucking birthday, Ghibli.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, also today marks the anniversary of
the first time that my friend Amanda and
[SPEAKER_08]: myself took dabs together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda has been in Colorado for one year
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, I don't know what Colorado would
be like without you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad you showed up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, fucking friends forever there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to get all sappy on everybody,
but some, uh, some landmarks to,
[SPEAKER_08]: to note.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to Gibbs and Amanda.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Glad you're on my roster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I said I was going to bring an email
to the table to read.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took a screenshot of it cause it's much
easier than going and searching through
[SPEAKER_08]: shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me read this message to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got two of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one says, uh, first of all,
he said sucks that, uh, sucks about the
[SPEAKER_08]: granny podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, you killed it with the emails
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we love your updates on your genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should give you guys a quick update on
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I said I would do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the mail plan, we are now,
the date is now the 17th.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are now 14 days in you guys,
the mail plant just started sprinkling a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of pollen, little itty bitty
bitty bits of pollen are coming out of
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The girls are just starting to go into
full flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see their calyx pistols are just
going nuts right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stretch phase is in full fledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, they'll quit stretching in about a
week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let them get pollen in about seven to
10 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll start getting a lot of pollen on
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got pollen in a jar for backup.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also got that male throwing pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're looking great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is going beautifully on the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is on schedule.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a whole lot to report other than the
male is balls are big and he's just barely
[SPEAKER_08]: starting to dump pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this message says, I was wondering what
you know about Fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really understand what is
happening and whether it's a good or bad
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, when it happens, maybe a good show
topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I replied with great topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a message that actually came
from a friend on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: The email has been killer lately,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a lot of topics, a lot of content
from the people that are sending the
[SPEAKER_08]: emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me your emails guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send them to me and grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the easiest way to reach me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easier if I filter all the questions
through that one channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll read your questions wherever they
come from, honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I know you're not, uh, some of us
are friends on Instagram, on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_08]: on whatever, uh, wherever we're friends,
I'll read it, but it's easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got more of a chance.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you hit me at grow from your heart at
hotmail.com, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this guy wants to know about Fox
tailing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fox tailing is when you're growing a bug,
some buds and they start popping off like
[SPEAKER_08]: little Fox tails, little fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just get, they start spreading out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them cheeto fingers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheeto fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Fox tails is the appropriate
term.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some strains it's genetic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if the bud stays compact, if it's
tight and it's doing what looks like a Fox
[SPEAKER_08]: tail, more like a crown, that's genetic.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's, if the bud is airy and you're
getting Fox tailing, that is most likely
[SPEAKER_08]: from too much heat.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's usually what that's from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plants are probably too hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably a little bit too close to
the light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming with that Fox tailing,
you may see a little bit of taco leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, your leaf will look healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll look cool except on the edges,
it'll be folding up like a taco shell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you could just make a little taco out
of your leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those are visual descriptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're seeing both of those,
it certainly is too hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've seen it most often when,
uh, we call it kissing the sky when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow up into the light while
they're in bloom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably what's happening to this
guy's poor plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if that's not the case, Fox tailing
could be from too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to spread out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the grossest description I could
give you, but it's completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike knows where I'm going with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, imagine you're in Las Vegas in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 114 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, your man junk tries to just move away
from your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: These plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your balls want to get away.
[SPEAKER_08]: These plants are too hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to get away from each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're starting to sweat.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting funky.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just trying to peel off of each
other.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're not getting sweaty and funky
and compacted in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants just trying to make some air
room for itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's trying to get spongy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Fox tailing out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to get fluffy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it's going to get, it's getting heat
stressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably what's happening,
or you could be overfeeding it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That also could, could make Fox tailing
happen.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of those three.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's nine times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plant hit the light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, some jelly bean phenotypes like to
make a crown shaped Fox tail, strawberry
[SPEAKER_08]: banana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tangy likes to make some crown shaped Fox
tails.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tangy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I guess it's a lot of things crossed
to that Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with the lemon Hayes phenol that
did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it got within eight inches of the
light, it was a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the plant would drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so the grower wouldn't get rid of
it because it would just literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were harvesting, it would just
drip THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know that plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closer, if it got within 10 inches of
the light, it would Fox tail like mad.
[SPEAKER_08]: So chances are, bro, your plant is getting
too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if that, if that's not the case,
send me a follow up message and we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about it on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I truly do appreciate the interaction with
my listeners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me more questions, more messages.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to read one more email.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's going to be quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm finding it on my phone here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did take another screenshot.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one says, Hey, I was listening to the
podcast today and I heard you answer my
[SPEAKER_08]: questions on the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's from Mazer four 20,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and he said, it was a trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he said, thanks for that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I say I work with robots,
I just meant they act like robots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause remember I asked, I asked,
I was like, are they real robots or
[SPEAKER_08]: there's people that act like robots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he said, I kind of like office space,
but different.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I got another question for the
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping you could shine some light
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it says show questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one, what are your thoughts on
monster cropping?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he said, I read that it's great
to use for Scrog.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I don't know a lot about monster
cropping.
[SPEAKER_08]: All you got to do is send me another
message and tell me what monster cropping
[SPEAKER_08]: is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you my opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll learn about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just tell me what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what you mean by monster
cropping.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of things that could mean
you could be by like snapping the stems
[SPEAKER_08]: and bending them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if that's what you mean, that's cool,
but it takes too long for my type of
[SPEAKER_08]: growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, number two, question he said,
I was curious to hear your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_08]: LEDs, any experience using one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any personal experience with
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't have a lot to tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tell you, I can tell you that it changes
the way your plants function.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've used, they do everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: They use their nutrients differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: They drink differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I've seen friends run side by sides
with LEDs and HPS lights and the LED
[SPEAKER_08]: plants and the HPS lights looked
completely different being fed the same
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They photosynthesize differently.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a whole new thing to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any experience with it
personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't guide you on any lights to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of time researching light
spectrums and their effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that'll answer some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only seen them really successfully
regularly used as an auxiliary color
[SPEAKER_00]: augmentation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when they're a primary light source,
the every harvest I've seen has been
[SPEAKER_00]: minuscule.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give a shout out to my friend,
Nancy Budwell.
[SPEAKER_08]: She grows with a very specific brand of
LED lights and she kills it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her plants are gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, but I've only ever seen the
cheaper ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've never seen like the $1,800
version.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lights that the Nancy are using,
those lights are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're thousand to $1,400 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, LEDs can be extremely expensive,
but allegedly you pay for it in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year in electrical savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're going to save.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to throw it down on the table to
walk out with that light, but you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: going to have to pay the electric bill
every month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I do with my HPS lights and you don't
have to run as much electricity on an air
[SPEAKER_08]: conditioner to cool it off also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge power saving there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I've never seen them
effectively used alone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out, uh, Nancy Budwell on Facebook
or Instagram, and she is a representative
[SPEAKER_08]: for a specific lighting company and she
has great pictures and she will guide you
[SPEAKER_08]: through your purchase of an LED light.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's something that you're really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he's got a third part to this
question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it says also wondering, what are your
thoughts on hempy buckets and deep water
[SPEAKER_08]: culture?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the pros and cons and your likes
and dislikes?
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not super experienced in deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember our friend from Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_08]: That dude grew some deep water culture
buckets and did some great work.
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem was if something goes wrong,
everything goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: If your pump goes out on that deep water
culture pump and you don't spray for three
[SPEAKER_08]: or four hours, if it quit spraying,
all your, your plants are going to die.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the major dislike to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I thought it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our buddy had five gallon deep water
culture buckets and his plants were taller
[SPEAKER_08]: than me and I'm six foot five and they
were putting on weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were packing it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the only problem is he had a lot of
fungus gnats all the damn time.
[SPEAKER_08]: He could not get rid of the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never done it myself, so I don't have
a lot of experience, but that's what our
[SPEAKER_08]: Hawaiian friend was experiencing from what
I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time researching
different growth methods and this one
[SPEAKER_00]: scares me because of its complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more complicated it gets, the more
random things might fail and cause your
[SPEAKER_00]: crap to suicide when you were only gone
for six hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm a soil grower.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, soil is insanely forgiving
and part of the reasons for that are what
[SPEAKER_00]: make me favor it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about deep water culture a
little bit because there might be people
[SPEAKER_08]: out there going, what the hell's deep
water culture?
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, deep water culture is a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a one, you can do multiple
site deep water culture buckets and you
[SPEAKER_08]: can have a main bucket that feeds or a
main reservoir that feeds multiple
[SPEAKER_08]: buckets.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for a one plant deep water culture
bucket, you've got a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_08]: and then there's a lid type device that
goes on top of the bucket, but it's got a
[SPEAKER_08]: little mesh basket cut out of the center
of it and you fill that area with hydro
[SPEAKER_08]: tongue clay balls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you put your clone that's in a rock
well, you just set it in there and then
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll root and the roots will hang down
inside of that five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: Inside that five gallon bucket,
you put a sprayer.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of different types of
sprayers available.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell a circular, it's a circle
sprayer that's got spray jets that shoot
[SPEAKER_08]: straight up and it's kind of a mister type
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially a long growth version of
the auto-cloner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a real big, easy cloner is
basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to mist those roots from the
bottom real heavily and you put nutrients
[SPEAKER_08]: in the water and a lot of oxygen,
heavily oxygenated and nutrient water
[SPEAKER_08]: spraying from the bottom so that those
roots hang down into that and grow into
[SPEAKER_08]: that spring water because gravity makes
the roots want to go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think gravity does.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they just want to go down
or if it's gravity.
[SPEAKER_08]: They may just want to do it naturally.
[SPEAKER_08]: The water's spraying up onto there and
it's growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I put it on a timer so that it stops
every once in a while so the roots can
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of dry so that they don't rot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you just keep it cycling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every 45 minutes, it shuts off for 15.
[SPEAKER_08]: That lets your water cool down so that the
pump doesn't overheat your water because
[SPEAKER_08]: the oxygen pump and the fucking moving it
pump is going to make that water hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people throw a chiller in there
to keep that water cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: If one piece of all that tech goes wrong,
your whole thing could die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant seems to really love it when
everything's humming, but it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things where if you're setting up
the one bucket version on the cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the quality of the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just require constant attention and
you have to understand that your plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a gun to its head and the hammer's
cocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece fails and that trigger gets
pulled and you start over, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I read that far in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next chapter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tanner Iskra So Mazhar, I know I couldn't
answer a lot of your questions,
[SPEAKER_08]: but at least I kind of gave you the
answers that I had.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know a lot about monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me what you think monster cropping
means because if you Google it,
[SPEAKER_08]: there are several different takes just
because that's a very common word.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: LEDs, no experience, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you what I saw from my friends,
Deepwater Culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: We ranted on what I saw from my buddy,
call him Pineapple Express because he's
[SPEAKER_08]: from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I used to call him all the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mazhar420, thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will talk more about this stuff on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we will.
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked up at Mike and he was just blank.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was staring into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the rig's looking at me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you need a dab?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to take some dabs on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did already and I think I'm probably
still good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to dab the rest of what is on
this parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some pineapple Jack from our
friends at Turbex.
[SPEAKER_08]: By last quarter gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's probably a quarter gram,
but I'm going to take this and then I
[SPEAKER_08]: think we're going to wrap up the show
after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, got anything poignant to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just we're gearing up for November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can do it online most
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you know what election issues
are coming up in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a minute to actually research them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a hell of election.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the news is focused on the circus that
is the presidential race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's the local stuff that
really, really, really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that's really going to
impact your day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say day to day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the local issue stuff of the
things that tend to really matter to most
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a minute to figure out what those
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local issues are now set.
[SPEAKER_00]: County voters will be voting on one
marijuana question, whether or not they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to ban the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: City voters will be voting on three
marijuana questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, do you want to ban the rec
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question, do you want to allow
recreational stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third question, do you want to tax
those stores at like four and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a confusing set of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's reasons for that, like a lot
of complicated reasons for all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: three questions appearing in front of
public city voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to know which questions,
which you need to know the wording so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't accidentally vote the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important that you know that
stuff, regardless of whether you live near
[SPEAKER_00]: me or not, because whatever the issues are
in your area, they will impact you
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you know what's up and make sure
you vote.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you gone to your Facebook page,
your Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Law's
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook page and kind of typed in
guidance on which way to vote since it is
[SPEAKER_08]: worded awkwardly?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a beautiful infographic
that helps with that, that the Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: poked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing some amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that John Rodriguez?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa Wheeler and I don't know the other
reporter's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks Lisa Wheeler and your
colleague who are helping us out in the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just doing solid, honest reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that's done, it leans far to the
pro cannabis side because that's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be a good reporter and not end
up reporting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But know the issues in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take that much time and it's
incredibly important folks get out and do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike always knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always got the right thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening and you're in the
industry, you should think about some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of show up with your I voted sticker,
get a da, da, da, da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome promotion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Owners, store managers, people that voted
get a something like a percentage off
[SPEAKER_08]: today, a free pre-roll if you spend
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And celebrate your freedoms.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Mike, thanks for coming and hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you got that little guy at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you want to go hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, it'll be good to get home,
but, uh, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I'm happy to get over here and I
love doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for coming on, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're always a good material.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_08]: You always bring good content.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, the next episode I have planned,
um, well, I don't even know if I should
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about Jesse coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse says he's going to come over
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike might go pick him up and make sure he
shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next podcast will either be myself
and Mike or Jesse and myself or myself,
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know how it's going to go in
these parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may or may not be a podcast recorded
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not be epic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you never know what could go on right
now, but I hope to have Jesse on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, you know, you're invited back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then after that, you guys, I will be
recording once again with the dab and
[SPEAKER_08]: granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to have her back on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tentatively scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, the intro about the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're test running everything to make sure
that this goes smooth this time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're 48 minutes in of this part of the
recording and everything's looking like it
[SPEAKER_08]: works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Things look good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks good so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: So far, so good.

features our good friends, White Mike and
[SPEAKER_08]: also Jesse Grose is back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about a little bit of outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about a whole bunch of randomness.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a really wonderful episode in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I did drop a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't catch the episode that came
out on Thursday, make sure you go back and
[SPEAKER_08]: check that one out.

[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy the music for a moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to bust a freestyle?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like you're about to let one go.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear freestyle rap.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear the White Mike freestyle
rap.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a White Mike freestyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trap rap.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about city council.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about city council.

[SPEAKER_08]: I have press record, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're recording at this podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
episode number 149.
[SPEAKER_08]: As promised, sitting to the left of me is
our repeat offender, a returning champion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast, our good buddy, Jesse Groves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, Jesse showed up with raw turps
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got some distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got some shatter.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's locked and loaded and ready to go,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for showing up ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to use your microphone voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I interrupted him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was about to take a drink of that
Prostacle Lou beer, and I started talking
[SPEAKER_08]: to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cotton mouth killer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of cotton mouth, we're taking
some serious dabs here today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse, before we get too far, tell
everybody on social media how they can
[SPEAKER_08]: stalk you while they listen to your sexy
voice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram, Jesse Groves, and then also you
can check out my podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a Facebook page, Colorado
podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys make sure you check that out,
support that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been on that show.
[SPEAKER_08]: A big shout out to Mick the dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, Mick the dog will be
joining us also on this podcast right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's taking a comfy seat underneath the
table.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a regular listener, you know the
other day I kicked the dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not mean to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse, thanks for joining us, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you follow at jessiegroves.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a look at his photography while
you're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out him out, see what he does.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk a whole lot about
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys also across the table from me,
another repeat offender, a returning
[SPEAKER_08]: champion, the guy that was here just last
night recording a show with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed you, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: White Mike is on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not a regular listener,
you can check Mike out.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter,
and he is also Pueblo for sensible
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you check out that group page.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been trying to train that in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of words for my stoner brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you on the last episode,
we need you out there fighting that part
[SPEAKER_08]: of the fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse will do the growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get us legal fight for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate having you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking time away from the baby,
the family, the dogs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were supposed to trim all night,
so I'm glad that you ended up not
[SPEAKER_08]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up trimming all night,
and then that got waved off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, back for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to be here with Jesse
finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a first.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've done celebratories, haven't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like 50 and 100.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're both here for those.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we did one before too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met you at this table doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed that memory away completely.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to remember some of those early,
early episodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're foggy in my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: People remind me of things I've said.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been done on those episodes,
and I'm like, wow, that happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to burst the balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been toting around all day,
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, this is the first meaningful
one.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The first grow oriented one.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is episode 149, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: 149 episodes into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't missed a week in two and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every Monday, you guys have had a podcast
to listen to, and some Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been running 20 episodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or tomorrow, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow will be your 20th.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was honored to be on one of those
episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, we did a, I call it a swap cast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned the phrase swap cast from Doug
Stanhope, but it's when two podcasters
[SPEAKER_08]: come together and record one podcast,
and then they both put it up on their feed
[SPEAKER_08]: so that everybody gets exposed to both
shows at the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did one of those with the Colorado
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit of chaos, but it is a
great show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to it on their feed so that they
get the clicks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the Colorado podcast page and listen
to that episode on their feed because they
[SPEAKER_08]: could use the traffic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some internet problems or some
website problems at the moment,
[SPEAKER_09]: so I'm not sure they'd be able to find
that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tech difficulties, mate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this episode won't come out for a
few days, so hopefully you've got that
[SPEAKER_08]: resolved by then, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully your tech guy is on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, I know a guy that'll work on that
one for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, I'm excited because
episode 150, it has been confirmed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode 150 is going to feature the
dabbing granny once again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I recorded the episode before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still heartbroken that it failed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone has been real supportive and
encouraging.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's all about coming back and
re-recording that podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dabbing granny went and bought special
hash to smoke with me to show me that she
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't mind doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So tomorrow night at a secret location,
I will be recording with the dabbing
[SPEAKER_08]: granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, it'll be at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time this goes out, it'll be too
late for anyone to show up and harass us.
[SPEAKER_08]: But tomorrow night at the Canna Canyon,
it'll be myself, dabbing granny,
[SPEAKER_08]: Brett from Evo Labs, and Lindsay,
the traveling stoner, and probably Bobo
[SPEAKER_08]: Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_08]: will be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully Ms. Camille will be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully Erin will be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully Bitty and Sirius will be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try to
[SPEAKER_08]: have a conversation like we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that is lost forever unless you
find it on dabbing granny social feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it was dabbing granny's
first podcast and she wasn't sure how to
[SPEAKER_08]: go about it right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now she is completely fucking
comfortable and she knows what to do on a
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a practice run, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: But 150 will be the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a cool way for karma to
land on us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a bad deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about outdoor growing,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk about these dabs,
this distillate, and these turps though,
[SPEAKER_08]: bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: You showed up with some delicious shit,
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remind me what's in each of these little
vials you got here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got Critical Mass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Critical Mass Turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Raw Distillate.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the OVM.
[SPEAKER_08]: OVM Orange.
[SPEAKER_08]: Vanilla Milano.
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Vanilla Milano.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to the Garden of Weeden for an
amazing breeding project.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was his first run chucking pollen and
those fucking, that strain came out
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I could tell him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had 12 females of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how much he's grown it
out, but I could tell him a little about
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could use a pack of those, Spencer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could use some of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what's this last one here?
[SPEAKER_09]: That is Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gorilla Glue Raw Turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys, they've figured out how to
take a plant, a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_08]: probably takes more than one plant,
but take a large batch of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: extract the terpenoids from that specific
batch, that one plant, and then you can
[SPEAKER_08]: get the essence, the flavor, the aroma,
the taste, and get it all in your face and
[SPEAKER_08]: all in your palate just with one little
droplet on a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can actually be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've learned that some require far,
far less than a droplet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Durban poison dabs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_08]: I overdone it on some that I took the
other night and it was just too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, that was way too much Durban
poison on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: This glue was like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think the terpenes are really
contributing to my high also.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me skyrocket to that next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became crystal clear when I started
playing with the distillate and the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you're taking the same THC
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you add it to something like the
critical mass, you go one way hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add it to something like the
Durban, you go the other way real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not changing the THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the other parts of the plant that
really shape that high.
[SPEAKER_09]: That entourage effects, the synergistic
effect.
[SPEAKER_09]: What Gupta talked about.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's exactly evident.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we're using the turps like this,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, good job.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your company's experimenting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give your company a shout out so that we
can hype them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Uncle Bud company.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Uncle Bud company based in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, we were pulling raw turps out
here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I- With no THC in them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero THC in these turpenoids?
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lab proven.
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these, it would not be, hypothetically,
I'm not going to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't fucking ask.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hypothetically, we could make these
available nationwide because there are no
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Diverting it out of metric is a whole
nother story.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Making them- So it's virtually impossible
for that to leave the Colorado marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: enforcement tracking system.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is stuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to get it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as a consumer, if you purchase it in
a store, if there's no THC in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: can it travel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also my assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's nothing, that's
turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenoids are not illegal cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a little glass vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend a lot of time
explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officer, stop hating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to Vitamin Cottage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get yourself some fucking- Theoretically,
it's also legal to ship in the mail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, theoretically, since it's just
turpenoids, I mean, you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: turpenoids- The mail vials a liquid in the
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing they're big on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, theoretically,
I'm not going to try it, but- I wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, but if there's really no THC in it,
I think there's a loop here to be played
[SPEAKER_00]: with if necessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a- Whoa, my mic got too
hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a website called justturps.com or
something similar.
[SPEAKER_08]: That where you can purchase turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy limonene.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy all of the turpenoids
separately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the big pretty wheel I've seen?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: But those turps are not derived from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are pulled from things like bananas
and roses and oranges and other fruits.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just the turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: People that are not able to smoke this
quality cannabis would be able- They'd
[SPEAKER_08]: have to get some dabs or some distillate
or something to carry it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can probably put this in like a vape
pen cartridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can mix that up with some VG,
some vegetable glycol or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've tried it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes vaping a little less gay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't going to go there about it,
but yeah, you could put that in a vape pen
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you can actually taste Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could taste this OVM.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could taste the Critical Mass.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could taste- I've got Ghost Train Haze
over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had Lemon OG or Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Lemon G, you guys, people do crazy
shit for me for the Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll stare at you like, can I get one
of them Lemon G dabs?
[SPEAKER_08]: They look like they got them white lips.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here for the Friday 5 o'clock free
Lemon G dab giveaway.
[SPEAKER_08]: They got VCRs and shit in their hand for
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something about the Lemon G turps are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had OG Kush turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Paradigym turps floating around
here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so delicious to taste these cannabis
turpains.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting spoiled.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really not that hard to extract them
either.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the right equipment and the
right knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, tell us what you feel
comfortable sharing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to pry too much information
out of you, but if there's something you
[SPEAKER_08]: want to tell us, we would love to know
some of your process.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get with me and give me a hundred
bucks, I'll walk you through the entire
[SPEAKER_09]: process.
[SPEAKER_09]: A hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already proven I can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I taught Rasta Seb how to do it over
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: A hundred is not enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should- Yeah, but I'm a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: 250 LAR consulting fee just for showing
up, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: 250 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes an investment in equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much would the equipment cost for a
small operation?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I had five pounds of plant material
to run.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much equipment should I buy?
[SPEAKER_08]: What would I be spending for a five pound
run?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're looking about 600 bucks and you're
going to be doing five runs instead of one
[SPEAKER_09]: five pound run.
[SPEAKER_08]: About a pound at a time and it's 600 bucks
in equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to go to the store?
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, we can do it on the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the hundred bucks so that you could
teach me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the next week's episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to order a bunch of shit
online.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the next episode, you're going to come
back and I'm going to just be sitting here
[SPEAKER_08]: covered in turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spilled some and I don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a solvent-less process, completely
and totally organic.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a little bit of a chemistry
background or- I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you just need to know someone who can
walk you through the process.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already been taught it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Between you and Brett Maverick,
I should be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Brett Maverick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I taught Seb how to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Rasta Seb also, by the way,
just a quick shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I'm ready to answer your
Facebook messages yet, bro, but shout out
[SPEAKER_08]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not ready to interact yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought Jesse on the show because Jesse
is my outdoor expert.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of pressure on you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: My outdoor expert.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means I don't know a lot of outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the previous outdoor grow episodes that
Jesse's done with you have been some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were you at home, I'd get a
notepad and a pen.
[SPEAKER_08]: John Randall's Jr. Get out a notepad and a
pen, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're taking notes right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put down the Pokemon Go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to take some notes about the
grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Charizard can wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Randall's, we love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: So outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are probably about three weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should start seeing the piss stills.
[SPEAKER_08]: The calyx pistols are starting to form on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those little, you guys call them hairs,
the white hairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are popping up on your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got girls, those are popping up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something super important and hyper
critical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your boy plants need to be fucking pulled
by now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Walk through your garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look for boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get rid of that shit because how far can
pollen travel?
[SPEAKER_08]: At least four miles or so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very far.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I don't want everybody's crop
getting pollinated because you're,
[SPEAKER_08]: well, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just let it a full solid burp on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was read.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need everybody's crop getting
pollinated because you're too lazy to pull
[SPEAKER_08]: a male plant out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: So go outside, pull the male plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't already done it,
you might be fucking up already.
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about it on another episode of
how quickly male plants drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a male plant in another room
right over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is like 15 days in and he is just
blasting pollen right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it only takes 15 or 16 days for serious
trouble to start happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't take long.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually, I've known an amateur
breeder that pollinated his neighbors grow
[SPEAKER_09]: that was let's say 400, 500 feet away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_09]: With trees, fences, houses, all kinds of
stuff in between.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh pollen is amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's its whole purpose of life is to
just land on a female plant and climb up
[SPEAKER_08]: that pistol and get up in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wants to get in the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of places that have
passed special rules keeping hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana grows like five or six miles
away just to make sure that there's never
[SPEAKER_00]: a legal war between like the big hemp
field and the big marijuana field.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally know a solution to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would grow my sense of Amelia grow right
next to a hemp field.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you willing to expose your secret on
the podcast?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know you told me the way you
told me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you tell us on the show or do you
want to keep that a secret?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hemp plants only pollinate once a year or
they only release pollen once a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So plan your bloom cycles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Accordingly.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But also most hemp growers like to grow
from a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's significant other ways you
can protect your own grow from the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy next door who doesn't know the
difference between a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to, it's part of the planning
and the research you should have done by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or he should have done.
[SPEAKER_08]: He should not have a male out there
outside in the first place.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually know a couple of breeders in
California that do everything outdoors and
[SPEAKER_08]: I just shake my heads at them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, Hey, you shouldn't be doing
that, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should, you'll be getting buds
right about now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll start seeing the bud sites.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to get in there and kind of take
off that lower shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, screwed them up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shaved the legs in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys get in there and clean off all
the lower canopy where the air is not
[SPEAKER_08]: getting in something where like a little
squirrel could get help climbing up the
[SPEAKER_08]: little ladder at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take that off of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: All that stuff that's going to hang down
and touch the dirt and get, get rid of
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: All those little sucker branches,
just a little thin pale yellow branches
[SPEAKER_08]: that are just shooting up, take all those
off.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go clean up the inside a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to focus on the tops of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where all the magic is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So clean them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hollow them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hollow them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pull them apart and spread them if you
can.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need to get a giant stick and stick
it in the dirt and pull one branch this
[SPEAKER_08]: way and one branch this way so that
they're getting sun properly, feel free to
[SPEAKER_08]: do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can take a beating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go out into your grow around noon,
one o'clock when the sun's really high in
[SPEAKER_09]: the sky and everything that's not getting
direct sunlight right then and there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's that kind of use that as
a guide of what to take off.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, you know, I mean, not
everything's going to be getting full
[SPEAKER_09]: sunlight, but you know, things that are
just in the dark, you know, at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, you can take that off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things that are, you know, a little
further down the side or bud sites that
[SPEAKER_09]: are further down the side.
[SPEAKER_09]: They may not be getting full sunlight,
but they're still getting sunlight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leave those there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, just judge accordingly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all that, all that dark stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely take that off.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be larpy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to turn that unless you're
making a bunch of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I mean, maybe leave that if you
want to, but it's going to take away from
[SPEAKER_08]: the energy up top.
[SPEAKER_08]: So stretch phase should be just about
over, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the first three weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really start stretching.
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be slowing down now so we can
see kind of how big our plants are
[SPEAKER_08]: actually going to be kind of get a
judgment of how tall they're going to be,
[SPEAKER_08]: how much panicking you need to do on
readjusting that fence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause a lot of people, I know,
I know some people that are that second
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, people are growing crazy outdoor
plants here in Pueblo and it's completely
[SPEAKER_08]: illegal to grow outside in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was banned, but there are people that
are doing it and they're just building a
[SPEAKER_08]: higher fence every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see them like had to put more plywood
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spotted another one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an old school giant back TV set
propped against a gate on the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the target place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I about died laughing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that time of year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be all over Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you're growing outdoors this
year and someone tries to steal your shit,
[SPEAKER_08]: don't fucking shoot them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow more weed next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that we have to do this episode
every year, but it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happened here though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody got shot trying to steal
somebody's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Outdoors and that medicine that was
supposed to be medicine became a target of
[SPEAKER_08]: theft, which became an attempted homicide,
which fucked that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need that vibe attached to this
plant at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we tried to make it legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we wanted it safely accessible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So nobody's getting shot over the shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We took it away from the cartels,
put it in the hands of the medical
[SPEAKER_08]: community.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do around you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not justifiable.
[SPEAKER_09]: It instantly makes it into a criminal
element or criminal enterprise.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're protecting your illegal crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't shoot anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, you guys, if you're listening to
this, you're probably not going to shoot
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all peaceful, cool ass people is
why you're listening to my show.
[SPEAKER_08]: So stretch phase is over.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to start seeing what size of
plants are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't top.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't top anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that's one of the next things I
had written down is no more topping.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hormones in the plants have all
decided where the tops of those plants are
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be and where they need to bake
the most energy, where they need to send
[SPEAKER_08]: the THC, where they need to send all the
energy for budding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quit topping them.
[SPEAKER_08]: No more topping.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can kind of bend them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can stretch them down, but don't cut
any more off the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tops of the plants, you can take all
that bottom shit freely, but the tops
[SPEAKER_08]: where the hormones have climbed up,
don't take that off of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: No more topping.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it time now to adjust the nutrients
that we're feeding them?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably, especially by the time this
comes out, but yeah, last week,
[SPEAKER_09]: both definitely now, but yeah,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can put this out Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Outdoor plants, they'll use a little more
nitrogen than indoor plants will through
[SPEAKER_09]: the bloom cycle, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep that bottle of bloom, or I mean
bottle of grow around.
[SPEAKER_09]: The way I do it is I'd probably just,
if I felt they need a little extra
[SPEAKER_09]: nitrogen shot, I just mix up some grow and
maybe a little cow mag and feed that in
[SPEAKER_09]: addition to the normal feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so add it on top of what you're
normally feeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Subcool take a bottle of nutrients
and pour it directly onto the soil on his
[SPEAKER_08]: outdoor grow and then just watered it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't recommend that, but I saw that
shit and it made me shake my head like,
[SPEAKER_08]: Subcool really did that, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like one of the most reputable growers you
could find on the internet, and that dude
[SPEAKER_08]: just poured a bottle of a nutrient I won't
even use straight onto the dirt and then
[SPEAKER_08]: watered it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be just fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Subcool's kind of from the south a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got that southern flavor to him,
so he doesn't give two shits most of the
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll hold my tongue on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on from Subcool talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to adjust the feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might want to keep, Jesse made a really
good point that I didn't think about.
[SPEAKER_08]: These outdoor plants are going to use a
little more nitrogen than what we're used
[SPEAKER_08]: to, so increase your nitrogen feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not going to be a bottle-fed
nutrient kind of guy, what kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: can we add to top dress to get a little
more nitrogen in there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right up your alley.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something about whatever they're
eating, the fish and the kelp that's in
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that really adds to the flavor and
the funky smell of good cushy bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think kelp and sea bird guano really
contribute.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ocean products make the best tasting bud
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done vegan, I've done the bone mills
and blood mills, everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my little ocean style kelp and crab
shell mill.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sea bird guano works good with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the product SeaPlex from
Organicare.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cold pressed blue algae based
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it makes the buds taste better,
smell better, they get more density.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's something else in there
that just makes them grow better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever's happening in that kelp,
that life that's in that kelp makes my
[SPEAKER_08]: plants happier.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely gives them a little boost.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kelp's the fastest growing plant on the
face of the planet.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all kinds of natural PGRs going on
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of this stuff is not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kelp is also a great bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can take kelp, put it in a court mason
jar, put a cup of kelp in there,
[SPEAKER_09]: go ahead and top it off with water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let it rehydrate for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strain any extra water away if there is a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Run that kelp through your food processor
and that'll turn it into just a mush.
[SPEAKER_09]: At that point, it dissolves into water and
you can foliar spray it as a bloom
[SPEAKER_09]: booster.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right there on your plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then store it in your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the back, keep it as cold as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll definitely make your plants happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you add any fulvic acid to that
spray?
[SPEAKER_08]: That wouldn't hurt a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it a little more absorbable?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's probably the recipe to a lot of
organic gluten boosters on the market
[SPEAKER_09]: right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the key, right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any foliar that you're spraying has got
kelp in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there sisilic acid naturally in kelp
like that, somewhere the sisilic acid
[SPEAKER_08]: comes in?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little bit, but the big source
of that is aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really popular right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could easily add some aloe vera into
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I actually going to do that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really good bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just made a new product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's fucking pad this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all now have no pads.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want me to write that down?
[SPEAKER_08]: That went up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That went into my grower brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, back in the day, we were taught not
to take too many notes because if your
[SPEAKER_08]: door got kicked in and there were notes
that said, feed on week six, feed on week
[SPEAKER_08]: seven, you just left a paper trail in your
handwriting.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had to have those plants in there with
no fucking notes and a good memory.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was harder at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things change in legalization,
and that's just one of the really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that not everyone even gets to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, I was scared to look at it on the
internet even.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even to Google, or back then it was like
Yahoo or American online.
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you part of overgrow.com?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was way too scared to ever ask questions
or post on it, but I totally read the
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking...
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally trolled it and looked at it?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to go look and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to make up fake accounts on other
sites.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just go look like that before I was
supposed to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Culture magazine had a really
good one too after they shut down
[SPEAKER_09]: overgrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the people from there went and
that's... I got into the forums years
[SPEAKER_09]: later.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I got my med card, I was like,
fuck this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I had my med card, it was game the
fuck on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, and a lot of people may argue
with me, I think that the OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_08]: the OG and OG Kush could be OG from
overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you met somebody from overgrow,
they'd just say, hey, are you fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse from OG?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you wouldn't want to say overgrow
because if it wasn't you, then I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: I just fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'd be like, from what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevermind, man, from this thing I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just called it OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you guys all on OG or what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that people were shipping
seeds around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like one guy had a seed and he shipped
some of them to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Jesse grew them and found the
phenotype he liked and bred to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then shipped those seeds to somebody.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that somebody ended up with a
bag of seeds and they called it the
[SPEAKER_08]: overgrow cook.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it kind of falls in there,
but that's the two I tend to believe
[SPEAKER_09]: personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are plenty of other stories of how
that happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't even bring up the podcasts that
I've heard them on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having the OGs I have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love some good OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Jeff's OG has got some flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be some Jeff's OG available on
the shelf at the store pretty soon here
[SPEAKER_08]: that John Randall Jr. trimmed up for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're top dressing with nitrogen heavy
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some- Well, not- I mean,
add them in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, add them in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, but don't go too hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you want to hit hard with your P's
and K's.
[SPEAKER_09]: P's and K's now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember it takes a week to two weeks
on a typical top dress for it to break
[SPEAKER_09]: down enough to be uptakeable by the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do it right now or in the morning,
whatever it is, that's not going to really
[SPEAKER_09]: take effect for at least a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that plant is already yellowing,
you're chasing it by now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should have done more nitrogen
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: So next year, do more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would still add nitrogen to keep it
from getting worse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that'll help your buds develop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll keep everything moving.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Other top dresses though, neem mill is a
favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crab mill is good for blooming.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then kelp.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, most organic bloom boosters are
made out of kelp.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you mess with the Karanja meal?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the neem mill mix I use.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 50-50.
[SPEAKER_09]: Neem and Karanja.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll keep most bugs out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll keep most bugs off the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll never notice it when in the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about defoliating because at
this point of the season, it's time to
[SPEAKER_08]: clean up a bunch of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you like to heavily defoliate or do you
just kind of clean them up?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more of a cleanup guy on outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get in there and clean them the fuck up
on an indoor garage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take off a lot of leaves to where
people look at you like you're crazy,
[SPEAKER_08]: but then they come back a week,
10 days later and all the leaves are back
[SPEAKER_08]: and they can't even tell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have a plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try it on this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got three of the same strains planted
in a row.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the one in the middle, they're all
about the same size.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one in the middle is going to get
tortured?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What strain do you have?
[SPEAKER_09]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: The old school Northern Lights number
five?
[SPEAKER_09]: The cut that goes around Denver shops
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the one that Spence bred to?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the cut I made my Grape OG with
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes some donkey dicks for buds for
sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes some huge, huge fucking buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So defoliate, you guys clean up in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically any leaf that looks like it's
going to be blocking a bud site from
[SPEAKER_08]: getting sunlight, just go ahead and pull
that fucker off and it's going to grow
[SPEAKER_08]: back because it's an outdoor plant and
you're going to be amazed at how quickly
[SPEAKER_08]: the leaves grow back.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll pull off a leaf the size of your
hand and in 10 days you'll have one back
[SPEAKER_08]: bigger than your head.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: They love the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've talked about feeding a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked a little bit about top dressing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about defoliating.
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned specifically that we need to
talk about caterpillar prevention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the time it happens every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we do to get rid of caterpillars?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've already got full grown
caterpillars inside your fully developed
[SPEAKER_09]: buds.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're fucked.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing you can do aside from just
manually picking through and pulling them
[SPEAKER_09]: out yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now is the time to apply those
preventative things that will keep them
[SPEAKER_09]: away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're going to have to spray your bud
sites, spraying your, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just heard voices in my head jump or the
volume in my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just turning you up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get far from the mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to fix it, but you fixed
yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need some bud site for that BT to be
on to ward off the parent from laying the
[SPEAKER_09]: egg in there in the first place.
[SPEAKER_09]: So BT is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like Captain Jack's Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bacillus.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I should Google that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You keep talking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll Google that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I recommend for getting rid of
any kind of bud warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now's the time to apply it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So also the garlic oil ferment that you
were talking about is very good for that
[SPEAKER_09]: too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even just essential garlic oil from the
health food store would probably have some
[SPEAKER_09]: of the same properties in it right there.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really close.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that's available from Captain
Jack's.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's available in Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very, very popular product used for
keeping away insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also usable.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will not cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: The mosquito dunks that you buy at
whatever Lowe's or Home Depot,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's the main ingredient in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can crush those up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can put that in some water.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can water that directly into your
soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: That will get rid of your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll get rid of most soil bound
creatures.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actinovate is another brand name.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a dry powdered product,
but it's same active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_08]: Natural has the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you're going to use any of
these powdered products beyond the dunks,
[SPEAKER_08]: the dunks are just fine probably to use
without a mask.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to use natural or
Actinovate, please wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research everything before use.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you get a new pesticide, if you take
that little booklet that's on there,
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody does this.
[SPEAKER_08]: That little booklet, if you open it up,
it tells you all the safety precautions.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tells you how much to apply on certain
types of crops.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tells you how long between
applications.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tells you what kind of safety equipment
you need to wear.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what kind of weather you need to apply
it in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that matters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if it's going to rain and you
apply certain things, it's just going to
[SPEAKER_08]: wash right off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just wasted that whole application
time and the expense on the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in there, it tells you the reentry
interval.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long from spring this product should
you avoid this room without wearing
[SPEAKER_08]: protective gear?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because some of the chemicals and products
that are available at your hydro store are
[SPEAKER_08]: much more toxic and dangerous than you
realize.
[SPEAKER_08]: They expect you to be a responsible adult
that can read that label.
[SPEAKER_08]: That bear stuff, the bear spray they sell
for your outdoor house at Lowe's,
[SPEAKER_08]: that can kill you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That can completely kill a human if you
fuck around and do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: So pay attention to the labels.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys read that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Read the safety sheets in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I sound like I'm preaching to you,
but a lot of the things that you can get
[SPEAKER_08]: from these products, you won't notice
until 10 or 12 years down the line.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll start getting a facial tick or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be from that time you sprayed
fluoromite into the fan and it came back
[SPEAKER_08]: into your face.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how they affect you too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the most nervous system and
reproductive system.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the exact same thing they do to the
insects they're tainted to kill.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to take a little while
longer on you because you're fucking in
[SPEAKER_08]: 160 pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, caterpillar prevention.
[SPEAKER_08]: Use that bacillus thuringiensis spray.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's available in Captain Jack's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Monterey Insect Spray has it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, a very good recommendation for
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't sponsor me in any way.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a company called Arbico.com,
A-R-B-I-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell all types of horticultural
supply, gardening supply type stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy almost any type of sprays you
want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy organic sprays.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell anything from stylet oil to
fluoromite in this one catalog.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also sell beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something I was going to talk
about on a future episode with you,
[SPEAKER_08]: but let's jump into it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beneficial insects is now the time to
release a whole bunch of beneficial
[SPEAKER_08]: insects.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that'd be totally cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Predator mites and ladybugs?
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lacewigs?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd go for ladybug larvae, especially
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: The larvae are a lot more productive,
meaning they eat more shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're still growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll hang around longer too.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the trick to keeping ladybugs to
stick around?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a trick to that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard some pretty awful things.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, outdoors is where I use them most
and just having a nice welcoming
[SPEAKER_09]: environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not normally many pests on the
plants, but there can be pests found in
[SPEAKER_09]: the mulches and the garden beds around.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's that works to keep them
around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stick around there too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel about a praying mantis?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got a shit ton of them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Arbico.com happens to sell praying
mantis larvae.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can order them, set the larvae on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will hatch and come alive in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can watch it happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen it happen, but I've seen
videos of it because I'm kind of an
[SPEAKER_08]: internet nerd.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, check them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: That company does not pay me anything,
but I mean, they've got all of the
[SPEAKER_08]: products that you need.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want a preventative to keep the
bugs away, if you want something a little
[SPEAKER_08]: stronger to destroy them, or if you want
to go full fucking madness nuclear,
[SPEAKER_08]: they've got the product for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can order it from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll ship it to you quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use that product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use that catalog all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for plenty of research to compare
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this versus this, which is better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just hold the pages side by side
and see what you like better and read
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they've got everything in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, if you get some fluoromide,
if you get something crazy, get yourself a
[SPEAKER_08]: Tyvek suit and some gloves, a mask,
suit up, go all Walter White style in that
shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also think you're a bastard for
spraying that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ever spray it outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't kill bees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Without the bees, you don't have any food,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything I eat grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I eat either grows or eats
something that grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your food eats my food.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be a pretty shooty place without
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want beneficial predators, predatory
mites is what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want some of the praying mantises.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the kind of bugs can we put out
there to help us out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Worms in your soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put worms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is a spider good luck in your garden?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a good thing to have one or two
spiders?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll eat most of the other bugs,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a wasp?
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got those too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to cause any problems,
are they?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually watched the wasps carry away
a full grown bud worm before.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here in Colorado, we get something that I
don't know if these happen anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Michael remember these.
[SPEAKER_08]: My microphone cover is bright orange.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get these orange bud worms.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard them called melon worms before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you get those in your buds around here?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never had those ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like a brownish green color,
but they're all beetles of some kind,
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe.
All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the orange ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the Captain Jacks and the Monterey
spray going to keep that shit away?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It affects them all equally.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for the most part, if you got
something really exotic and crazy,
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but I know here in southern
Colorado, it takes care of anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if somebody is local, if they're here
in the Pueblo, Colorado area, where can
[SPEAKER_08]: they go pick up some good sprays to take
care of their insects?
[SPEAKER_09]: One Love Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I can remember the address.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 116 East 4th Street, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: 618.
[SPEAKER_08]: 618.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the right numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was close.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was close.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's dyslexic or some shit on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, 618 East 4th Street.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go support One Love Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Burns down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a great lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go say hi to my beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go say hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go support that place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go support local businesses if you can,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been going for like 40 minutes
talking about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys have any outdoor grow
questions that you would like me to ask
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse, send them to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will compile the questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take screenshots into my phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put them all in one little section
and then I'll get Jesse back over here and
[SPEAKER_08]: we will address your questions
specifically so that we can help you out
[SPEAKER_08]: with exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of dial it in and aim it a little
more at you specifically and get what you
[SPEAKER_08]: need.
[SPEAKER_09]: One other quick thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plants are going to start using more
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't just give them what they'll take
and what they need to stay perked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want big fat buds, you got to get
them lots of water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of water.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that mainly applies to in-ground
plants, but same for potted container.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll only take so much water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as soon as it dries, give it some
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't sleep in and think you can water
those plants later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to get out there and water them
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not willing to stay on it,
don't start it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you let them dry out, it's a noticeable
chunk out of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it's a noticeable percentage.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that in indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you feel about using a drip system
in an outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've promised the listeners that I would
talk about building a drip system,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's not a lot of plant involvement
and I don't want to spend too much of an
[SPEAKER_08]: episode talking about building PVC pipes.
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually kind of be a hard episode
because it's not really hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something that just go do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get your hands dirty and do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give them like a five or 10 minute
primer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what you need.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a pump and some tubes and a
fucking octopus head and then some tubing
[SPEAKER_08]: and some sprinklers and then you build
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems really daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tutorial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Jesse said, just doing it because you
got to get out there and measure.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a tape measure and a PVC pipe
cutter and just got to go to town and
[SPEAKER_08]: learn how to build.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Legos basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought these two $30 kits from Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd never really done a drip system
before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a little nervous and by the
afternoon I'm like, I'm a fucking expert.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boys playing with Legos is essentially
what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have all of the parts over there at
Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to that little section and look
around, your head will just start spinning
[SPEAKER_08]: and you'll know what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do a quick lesson on it in the future
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I might let you come hang out with me and
talk me through it also.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right guys, we've gone 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything funny you want to ramble
and talk about chaotically?
[SPEAKER_08]: Randomly that you want to make sure that
people hear on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you got coming up that you want
to share with people?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just put you guys on the spot and you're
both looking at me blankly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Secret Sesh is coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, August 27th.
[SPEAKER_08]: I cannot reveal the location, but it is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same day as Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got to go to Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not into the headlining band.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not feeling it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That will happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to leave during the
headlining band and then I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_08]: over to Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, I wish I could tag you in for the
headlining band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it my boys?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they're able to play Reggae on
the Rocks, like I'm less of a fan than I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's favorite band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: 311 is Mike's favorite band.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggae on the Rocks?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're playing with Iration.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 311 and Iration doing a set together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a beautiful venue for that band.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the first time a plebeian snuck
into the Roman council or some shit like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggae on the Rocks has been not as reggae
every year.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the politest way to say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: While the band has gotten slightly more
reggae.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two of my favorite reggae bands ever are
opening the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steel Pulse, of course, if you're a reggae
fan, you know good old Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've ever hung out with me,
you know I love Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Morgan Heritage is also there.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had to just pick two reggae bands
that defined what I like about reggae,
[SPEAKER_08]: those would be the bands.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a great show for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get all sunburnt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when it starts getting all 311-y,
that's about when I'm going to take off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, God, 311 is going to come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your hair is so cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met 311 backstage at Warped Tour one
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won tickets in a meet and greet from
Kilo.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: The dopest thing was this dope ass
Jansport backpack I got in the giveaway
[SPEAKER_09]: too because I'm not a 311 fan either.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there's a 311 used to actually
get in fistfights with Sublime,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that a lot of people,
they sound like the exact same band.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't like 311.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole time I was bringing up all
these fights and these guys are like,
[SPEAKER_09]: man, these guys are lame and just kind of
wandered off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't as polite as you are now
either.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you're having a little more fun
with them than you're letting on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have trolled them a little bit
before trolling people was a thing.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's remind everybody how they can check
us all out on the social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you want to follow me on
Instagram, I am at irey underscore
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most other things just search grow from
your heart and you'll find me.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to send me an email,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse, tell us about your podcast one more
time and how everyone can find you on the
[SPEAKER_08]: social media.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check me out on social media, jessiegrows

four microphones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody welcome to the Grow From Your

[SPEAKER_15]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, 150 here at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm fucking stoked.

[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just slowly introduce everybody

[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, to my left,

[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for screwing it up the first

[SPEAKER_08]: So sitting to the left of Dabbing Granny
is my new friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: They call him THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is Sam from THC Magazine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me on

[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And next, let's get the mic a little
closer because I'm not sure we got you too
[SPEAKER_08]: much, but I'll make sure that we pump you
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll guide you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the guy that's excited,
you're bouncing in your chair,
[SPEAKER_08]: bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Instagram over there, Mr. Fish Eye on
the phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since everyone here is a Terp or he is a
Terp slut.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's our Terp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a slut.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the white Terp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_15]: You are the Terp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's all good.
[SPEAKER_15]: That name was given to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not declare that myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I did not proclaim that myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Rooster Brecht, the Terp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything Granny says to me, I'll take.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's official shit once Granny says it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brent is, of course, the lab manager at
Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is partially responsible for all these
beautiful cannabis extracted terpenes that
[SPEAKER_08]: we've been enjoying and we truly
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about terpene
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to try to pry into his
business a little bit here in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: But across the table is one of my heroes,
the guy that makes the fucking tables with
[SPEAKER_08]: emails built into them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What up, guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my buddy, Bobo Blasterko.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, thanks for coming up to the Canna
Canyon and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a little jelly I wasn't here for the
first one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were in Florida, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy I could be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were on the beach with the dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm still jealous about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I heard they're like, oh,
we were at Canna Canyon, I was like,
[SPEAKER_10]: oh, the terps.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, a huge sesh.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, on these cozy couches with Deb and
Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And orange soda.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this orange soda hash that Granny
brought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last time it was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: She went and got more for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: She says that if this hash keeps becoming
available from Incredibles, she's going to
[SPEAKER_08]: go broke.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I will be down on Nevada in my high
heels and my red lips and my painted
[SPEAKER_16]: fingernails.

turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_16]: You must go through the Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_16]: She is my official manager for Nevada.
[SPEAKER_08]: Copyright.
[SPEAKER_08]: Deb and Granny's turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_08]: This podcast started off wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we work together or something?
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get her and I can get your guy or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got you.

[SPEAKER_08]: Did this show just become Tinder?
[SPEAKER_15]: What just happened over here?
[SPEAKER_15]: Binder Tinder.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dabbing Tinder.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever those things are.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Podcast listeners, I'm going to put this
show back on track a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here live at the Cannon Canyon,
the Cannon Canyon, Colorado Springs'
[SPEAKER_08]: premier social lounge where you can come
and if you're 21 and over, you do not need
[SPEAKER_08]: a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're 21, you have an ID and you're
not a dick.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can come here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can sign a member agreement.
[SPEAKER_08]: There may be products available that if
they share it with you, you may reimburse
[SPEAKER_08]: them for the products that are available
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oftentimes, there are some tasty hashes.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are tasty flowers here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you tip your bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be kind to everybody and clean up after
yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might come take some dads with Bobo
Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_08]: with Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know who could be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The traveling stoner is here quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might get to meet Biddy the dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may meet Sirius.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This place is cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: The couches are comfy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The air conditioning is kicking and it's
the summertime so this is the place to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dab and Granny, I see you here a lot now
that I've bumped into you and met you.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is my favorite dab loan.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is like sitting in somebody's living
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it that there are no TVs here.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the other social lounges have TVs and
everyone just zones out into a TV.
[SPEAKER_16]: Or there's pool tables or
[SPEAKER_16]: talking, exchanging knowledge and giggles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of giggles today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exchanging Terps, exchanging grown
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a new friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend Sam over here has also
experienced a head injury and he's writing
[SPEAKER_08]: a book about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we talk about your book?
[SPEAKER_08]: A little closer.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little closer.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get you introduced.
[SPEAKER_08]: You heated up a nail and then I started
talking to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to miss that dab opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: When do you expect your book to come out?
Over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have that book prepared,
I'd love to read it and have you on the
[SPEAKER_08]: show and talk about it because it's great
talking to other people that have
[SPEAKER_08]: experienced traumatic brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thankfully, my parents were big fans
of holistic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't too big of a fan to put me
right on any kind of pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_01]: thankfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thankfully, that was a pretty great
decision on their part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, to speak on something else
besides head injuries, when I was in
[SPEAKER_01]: college, I blew out some ligaments in my
knee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cannabis is much more of an effective
pain reliever than a lot of the opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get prescribed so quickly and in
such large doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cannabis is really just something that
a lot of people should really be more
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of and if even not aware of,
just more accepting of.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And no addiction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't go down that black spiral of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is good for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, thanks for joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'd love to read your book when it's
available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need any insight or you want to
talk about it, I'd love to hear more about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if everybody could check out the
hemp connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I was headed next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a writer and photographer with
THC Magazine, the hemp connoisseur based
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Denver, but we actually recently
just went national.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have copies of the new national,
the new summer edition in Barnes and
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobles across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we hope everybody can be on the
lookout for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, tons of content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if everybody wants to follow the hemp
connoisseur on Instagram as well,
we'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about Terps, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of building it up so we can save
Granny a little bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like Terps though.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll turn Granny on for you.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Granny loves Terps more than life
itself.
I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look how cocky you are.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like that's my favorite part about
you, Brett.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just love Brett.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you not love Brett?
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just a walking smile with Terps
in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it a walking smile with Terps in his
pocket?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's probably the best problem I've ever
gotten.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, tell us more about, so on the,
we recorded this podcast before and I
[SPEAKER_08]: asked, explain to me what a Terp is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice and easily so that everybody,
but keep in mind that more than 50% of my
[SPEAKER_08]: listeners are from a place where cannabis
is illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they know very basic knowledge about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's break it down to where they're
able to follow along with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Terpenes are in basically every type
of, well, there's two different types of
[SPEAKER_15]: things that could be in fruits or
vegetables and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Terpenes are esters, but a lot of stuff
that you get either a smell from or a
[SPEAKER_15]: taste from comes from some type of Terpene
combination.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Terpenes are in apples, oranges,
bananas, everything, they also are in
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, from my understanding, as of right
now, there hasn't been any esters found in
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis, but there are tons of Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are over 115 Terpenes,
150 Terpenes that make up kind of a plant
[SPEAKER_15]: profile.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, right now, the best labs can maybe
test for 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe 34, maybe the best labs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I honestly don't even know how
accurate those 30 tests, those 30 Terpenes
[SPEAKER_15]: to testing is actually how accurate they
are.
[SPEAKER_15]: But, and then after that, there's some
companies that can go for 15 or even 10.
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, it's, it's, that's basically,
there's a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_15]: Terpenes that make up a plant profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the Terps are basically what give a
cannabis plant its smell.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's smell, it's taste, but also there's a
lot more than just smell and taste to it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And this guy Sam next to me knows a lot
about the health benefits and actually
[SPEAKER_15]: knows a lot about Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what actually the big article
in the magazine is about.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he knows a lot about the health
benefits.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a lot of stuff to do with the
floral, the smell of it, the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what most people that buy it,
only understand, but I have learned a lot
[SPEAKER_15]: from Sam about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say I'm a total expert,
but I've definitely had a chance to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit about Terpenes on a little
bit of a different level, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the articles in the summer
edition of the hemp connoisseur and
[SPEAKER_16]: Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically as popular as Terpenes are
for flavor, they do a lot more medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a chance to talk with Max
Montrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the head of the Tricom Institute and
he is, you know, he is probably the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Terpene head, the Terpene expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gave me, you know, a really nice
little education and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are basically the way he
described it and the way that I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: explained it in the article is basically
like a glass of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have a fresh cannabis plant,
that's a fresh glass of beer with all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those bubbles floating off, all that
carbonation floating up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time that disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time with a fresh cannabis plant,
those fresh oils, those fresh Terpenes on
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the plant are going to
disappear over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those not only add flavor,
but they also add, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene, a lot of medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are anti-psychotic,
they're anti-seizure, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a whole lot of different things
that we're just really starting to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also depending on what time of harvest you
do with the plant, you can also pull
[SPEAKER_15]: different Terpenes with it too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that, Jeff, I don't know if you,
I mean, you grow a lot more than I do,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I know that if you chop plants,
certain plants earlier, certain plants
[SPEAKER_15]: late, you can get a higher CBG or CBN rate
usually.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that can actually help with what in
the end, what Terpenes you pull off that
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what fascinated me most,
I think, about my conversation with Max
[SPEAKER_01]: Montrose is really that what people think
is the medical benefit coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids might really be coming from
Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really kind of, you have to really
combine the two to really get a full
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of really what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause every strain has CBD, CBN,
CBG, depending on the strain to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really kind of the same ratio,
but what really differentiates a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: strains is that Terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause not every strain is going to have
that certain combination of Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the combination of that Terpene profile
and the cannabinoids in that specific
[SPEAKER_01]: strain kind of contribute to the overall
effect and the overall medical benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: that people get.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've noticed when I take a small dab and I
dunk it into a little bit of Terps,
[SPEAKER_08]: I get way higher than I would get from a
dab a little bit bigger than that dab
[SPEAKER_08]: size, if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's still studies going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely understand what Sam's talking
about and I have read about it and I do
[SPEAKER_15]: have talked to Max and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do know that there are still more
studies, hopefully that there's going to
[SPEAKER_15]: be even bigger studies going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously with the advancement of cannabis
in this community, hopefully more studies.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what Sam was saying with is really
true how without Terpenes cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_15]: might not transfer in your brain or
transfer in your body the same way.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what kind of might, there's
still studies.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not, don't quote me obviously,
but I know that there's people talking
[SPEAKER_15]: about without the Terpenes, you can't get
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I felt it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you don't get the full.
[SPEAKER_16]: But wouldn't a good example be taking the
distillate or which is pretty much all the
[SPEAKER_16]: Terps are pulled out.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you smoke that by itself,
which you're not supposed to do,
[SPEAKER_16]: we're not advocating that at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I do, I do put Terps in it
sometimes, but honestly, sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know Jeff actually took a nice,
he tried to take a nice half gram dab of
[SPEAKER_15]: some distillate.
[SPEAKER_15]: One night I had the secret session,
I just walked up, I had this half gram
[SPEAKER_15]: distillate left in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, who wants to take this right
now to the dome?
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jeff honestly was like, I'll do that
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were on your way to ask a specific
question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to ask what you were trying to
ask?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a brain fart now, I don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I do want to say, wow, nice pressing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about this awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's, let's give a big shout out to this
local artist.
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought my rebel recycler with me,
of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just so happens my little iron matches.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it kind of sold me now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of need to get one now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those little irons are adorable.
[SPEAKER_10]: It presses it so unbelievably.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I've been trying to use tons of
little tools and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: bottom of jars and like little flat glass
surfaces I could find, but like this thing
[SPEAKER_10]: is perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can press out a really wide piece of
solvent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's explain what we're talking about a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like literally like a two inch by
one inch really looks like a glass iron.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like a, an iron that you would iron
your clothes with, but just glass and you
[SPEAKER_10]: would heat that up to press out some of
this full melt ice hash that we have here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just ironing out, just like a
shirt, trying to get all the creases out
[SPEAKER_10]: of it, get it all flat and doesn't get as
funky.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have you come over and iron
my shirts for me sometime with that little
[SPEAKER_15]: tiny iron.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the big difference is that does not
leave your nail black.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all the list does burn nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like you're trying to sneak
something in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I'm really sad how much you like
those irons.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause there was two purple ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Granny got one of them and there was
another one and I was like, Oh man,
[SPEAKER_12]: I should scoop that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause it matches his rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, you know, he's not going
to want that.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's going to be like, why'd you buy me an
iron?
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, crap, that one's gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask away something about Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Distill it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Granny was thinking that we,
uh, no, my point was that, uh,
[SPEAKER_16]: it can be hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_16]: You get a better medicated feeling.
[SPEAKER_16]: Once you add any of the Terps,
like I like in the morning, I like that
[SPEAKER_16]: lemon G or the ghost train haze.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's wonderful for in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: My two favorites, Granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: At night, Zen Berry or that Blackberry
Kush.
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's why I was saying,
I know I personally feel that without
[SPEAKER_15]: terpenes, cannabinoids wouldn't transfer
in your, your body the right way.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the same way as I don't want to say the
right way, the same way as they do right
[SPEAKER_15]: now when with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know one thing is I love Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all of us do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, my question, I forgot the question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, do you, can you give me examples of
like what specific terpenoids work for
[SPEAKER_08]: specific conditions, what they may help
with?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we already know a lot of us know
that like high HD strains will work well
[SPEAKER_08]: for seizures.
[SPEAKER_08]: High CBD works good for like epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he's got an article in his hand to
refer to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it when people come with research.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we're going to learn what terpenoids
will help with specific ailments.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's pulling out a chart and helping them
find the right page.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to his page turner, Brett over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the first example that I'm
looking at right here is Humaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what would that kind of smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Humaline is common in a lot of sativa
strains and, uh, basically in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal value, it's anti-tumoral,
antibacterial, and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steep Hill Labs has done a lot of
research on individual terpenes and their
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another place that I've done some
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing I can tell you about Humaline,
it's also, uh, a natural, uh, you don't
[SPEAKER_16]: want to eat.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, it's like a diet pill almost.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Brain fart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you give me a couple more examples?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like maybe one or two more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that's really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure our listeners would love
learning about the terms as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: BTWs, you can read all of this in THC
magazine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not trying to make him read his whole
magazine, but I wanted to get at least two
[SPEAKER_08]: or three good examples.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just another shout out to THC magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quote from Steep Hill actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Lionel Lue was a critical precursor in
the formation of vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been used in the treatment of both
psychosis and anxiety and as an epileptic,
[SPEAKER_01]: as an, as an anti-epileptic agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that one smell like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Lionel Lue is very floral, like lavender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably my least favorite turf.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do not appreciate the smell of
lavender and lilacs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It drives my nose crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me want to sneeze and pick my
nose for some reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's chunks in my nose.
[SPEAKER_16]: It smells like bathroom stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like your grandma's bathroom.
[SPEAKER_16]: My bathroom doesn't smell like that,
but it does smell like grandma's bathroom.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I could smell your bathroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to a restaurant, somebody served me
rose ice cream and asked me what I thought
[SPEAKER_08]: and I said, it tastes like grandma's
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've never eaten rose ice cream again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ruined that for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what common one that everybody
loves, D-lemonine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that lemony really citrusy
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown to be helpful with
symptoms of depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different terpenes are definitely
useful for a lot of different things and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're only really just starting to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that why we love it so much?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it helps us not be anxious and
helps us not be depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of sativa strains are
really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They help with depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably ... What's your favorite
term?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have to say limonine or
probably mersinine.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mersinine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I like mersinine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I like pineine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably go limonine too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that lemon.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys are growing ... Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to reveal a pro tip that is a
million dollar tip that I don't say a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: on the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've said this one time in a way previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen up.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got a sativa strain that has
limony flavors and lemon characteristics
[SPEAKER_08]: and you want to bring out the D-limonine
terpenoids, let it get a little bit too
[SPEAKER_08]: close to the light and it will panic and
it will start creating D-limonine as a
[SPEAKER_08]: panic response in defense and that will
bring out your limony flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned this on accident by getting my
plants too close to the light too many
[SPEAKER_08]: times and I'm like, why are they always
still limony?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, wait, those are the plants
that almost got burned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm 90% sure that that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from my experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think getting the plants too close to
the HPS light will bring out the limonine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Drop your lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the light real close to that lemon
jeffery.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're putting the biggest smile on my
face right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: We all are smiling.
[SPEAKER_16]: Guys, that was a cool tip.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for sharing that Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it was just what you just did is
the reason I started listening to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was your enthusiasm for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think through the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's how we got introduced.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we got introduced.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we know Brett.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's the phone snatcher.
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you subscribed THC Sam to the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_15]: If he's not listening, I don't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to go to hog time or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brett, we'll grab your phone and subscribe
you to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got an iPhone and you're around
Brett, you will open up your phone one day
[SPEAKER_08]: and you'd be like, when did I subscribe to
a podcast?
[SPEAKER_12]: Grab your friend's phone and subscribe
them to the Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely got a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been lacking on the podcast game,
so I will be subscribing to the following.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't expect everybody to listen to 140
episodes of me rambling.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't expect everybody to listen to
that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm almost there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag you like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's your podcast.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, guys, by the way, special shout out
to Rasta Jeff for this podcast that aired
[SPEAKER_16]: on Monday.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this guy pulled it together and it
was like, wow, what a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are a pro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to put the podcast together
Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I'd better throw an intro on
that, put the memory card in the computer,
[SPEAKER_08]: put the part that we recorded at the
canyon into a show and then put an outro
[SPEAKER_08]: on it and post it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I pulled out my memory card and it said
files are unreadable.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to pull a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about eight or nine o'clock and the
podcast usually drops at midnight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had three or four hours to put
together a podcast, record it,
[SPEAKER_08]: edit it up, air it, get it up on the
website.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I pulled it off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was up there by 1159.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks for all the love.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I got the notification, I was like,
is it an encore?
[SPEAKER_16]: And I listened, I was like, wow,
kudos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily I've got some notes prepared for,
I try to stay one or two shows in advance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, there's a show that'll come out
before this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: 148 came out today.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is 150.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've obviously got one in the can ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, shout out to my friends that help
me record podcasts all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate all of you guys, the guys
that are here and not here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for taking hours out of their
day to come take dabs and record podcasts
[SPEAKER_08]: with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate each and every one of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tough job.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, honestly, if we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that Wally Pot medicated?
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I wish it was, but Lindsay's donuts
were medicated.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_16]: What donut?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, last time, first of all,
I tried to give you a donut last time on
[SPEAKER_12]: the last one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Starfire Edibles.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's those little donuts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have a shout out to Starfire
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_12]: They are made with solventless hash and
they are incredible.
[SPEAKER_12]: She makes amazing different flavors.
[SPEAKER_12]: She makes cake cones.
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't go into it too much, but Starfire
Edibles, shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out, shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like you like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like you like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're my favorite edibles right now,
actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm afraid of edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that listen to the podcast know
that I ate way too many edibles one time.
That's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been kind of gun shy since then.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go this direction again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was telling Granny about how I found
her.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was scrolling through Facebook one day
and there was no sound in the video,
[SPEAKER_08]: so I'm going to cut the sound out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're like, check out this lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just somebody reposting your
video.
[SPEAKER_08]: You took a big ass dab, like a dab that I
would take probably a half a gram,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least a 0.3, maybe a 0.5.
[SPEAKER_08]: You sucked that dab in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You held it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You chugged a beer.
[SPEAKER_08]: You chugged a shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you grabbed, you blew out your
dab and you grabbed your nectar collector
[SPEAKER_08]: and did another dab and blew that one out
and smiled at the camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like nothing had happened.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of what I'm known for.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what she does.
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess you should not be proud of it,
but I am.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because really, can you see your mother or
your grandma doing a knockout and smiling?
[SPEAKER_16]: And then most people think, oh,
she's laid out.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll come back and do another big dab for
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably smoked, there's six people
here in this group.
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably smoked three or four grams of
shatter in the hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: That we've been hanging out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been hassle consumed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And granny takes a lot of big dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: She is not shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's taking more dabs than me because I
feel like I try to keep my throat a little
[SPEAKER_08]: composed for the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: But granny goes in, she takes some big old
dabs.
[SPEAKER_16]: We all have been dabbing out.
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, everybody needs to watch social
media for the best group dab ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to post that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to post it.
[SPEAKER_12]: He already did actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about to go up on the THC magazine
account, the hemp connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you follow the hemp connoisseur
account on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see our group dab video.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were six of us doing a big dab over
here at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was glorious.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still very smoky in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually cracked the door.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like every time we come here,
they crack the back door.
[SPEAKER_08]: I take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: They clean out their e-nail a couple of
times, their rig, because I've globbed it
[SPEAKER_08]: all up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been like, who's here globbing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just in the corner.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how I found dabbing granny was
watching her do strikeouts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then somebody was like, she lives in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm like, she shops at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started following you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, this lady and I cross
paths.
[SPEAKER_08]: We go to all the same places.
[SPEAKER_08]: You shop at Green and Healthy Wellness
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_08]: You support all the dispensaries in town,
which is one thing I love.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that you don't just go pick one
place and say that they're the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that you go out there and
experience all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of am a representative for the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm going to go all over.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to give one dispensary my
plant count.
[SPEAKER_16]: Be fair for somebody to say, oh,
we own the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a free agent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tell everybody what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Colorado, if you're a medical marijuana
patient, you are allowed to grow a
[SPEAKER_08]: specific amount of plants, based on what
your doctor feels is appropriate,
[SPEAKER_08]: based on your medical condition,
or honestly, based on how much money is in
[SPEAKER_08]: your pocket.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just costs more, honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you pay for an elevated plant count is
what we call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that allows you to grow more
plants and also to possess more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you go to a dispensary in Colorado
Springs, we are medical cannabis only.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way that those dispensaries are
able to grow is those plants that those
[SPEAKER_08]: patients have, they can allow the
dispensary to grow those plants for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We call it signing over your card,
signing over your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: You become a member.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what granny's talking about is
she's not going to let anybody have her
[SPEAKER_08]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's in charge of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: She is her own.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a free agent.
[SPEAKER_08]: She grows on her own.
[SPEAKER_08]: None of these dispensaries own her.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have her plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't brag about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully granny's got a nice garden
of her own, but that's none of our
[SPEAKER_08]: business unless she wants to tell us.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the first thing about
growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always,
[SPEAKER_16]: I've always smoked.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've smoked long before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, this dabbing thing was pretty
new, um, about what, maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the dispensary I was going to,
they kept saying, you need to try this.
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to try this.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, y'all are young boys with slept back
hats.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to try this.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not for me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm an old lady.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then actually it was the owner of
the Canna Canyon, Aaron and Pete.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were like, come on, try it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have a high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_16]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wasn't too big on it because I didn't
know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then November, I got a portable email.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I tell that story?
[SPEAKER_16]: You can definitely tell any story you want
on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to shout out to DeBato up in
Denver because they're the ones that
[SPEAKER_16]: encouraged me to go in front of a camera
when I didn't know what the hell I was
[SPEAKER_16]: doing and do dabs and smile and talk.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I was like, but why should I do
it?
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're like, cause people will like
you and people like me.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can handle it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's several things that
intrigue people, especially the normal
[SPEAKER_08]: people that aren't in Colorado taking dabs
and the people that don't get to dab and
[SPEAKER_08]: the people that when they do take dabs,
it's a pea size and they get high as shit
[SPEAKER_08]: because they rarely get to dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're blown away by this old lady taking
a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's like my grandma taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_16]: But now everybody wants to dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody wants to dab with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess you keep it quiet that you're
coming here because otherwise this place
[SPEAKER_08]: just fills up with people trying to meet
granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have learned, don't say where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually speaking to that in the August
issue of the Hub Connoisseur, I had the
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to do an interview with Dab and
Granny over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to talk about kind of how she
started with cannabis and exactly what you
[SPEAKER_01]: just talked about, kind of how she's
changing what it looks like to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's changing what it looks like to
use a blowtorch, to heat up the nail,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a big dab and to, you know,
it also changes what people's opinions
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes what people's opinions look
like of, you know, what a high tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like, what actually functioning on
that high tolerance looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just, you know,
a really cool thing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people are really
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence her massive following.
[SPEAKER_08]: Massive following.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many Instagram followers do you have
now granny?
[SPEAKER_16]: I woke up this morning to 151.
[SPEAKER_16]: Only 151?
[SPEAKER_16]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: No dude, she just hit 150 like two days
ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: She got a thousand followers.
[SPEAKER_15]: You only got 151?
[SPEAKER_15]: You're telling me she only has 150 people.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm fucking around.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to add the K to the end.
[SPEAKER_15]: People don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have 151,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I tell you guys a funny story about a
grab lounge last night?
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of my followers might not know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you just say 151, they might just
think they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I haven't even been on social media a
year.
[SPEAKER_16]: But last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: 151,000 followers in one year,
granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then look, I'm on Periscope,
Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_13]: All you do is talk and do just what we're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_16]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know the best thing about being
Deb and granny?
[SPEAKER_16]: What?
[SPEAKER_16]: This right here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Look how many young people I have brought
together tonight.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have exchanged a conversation.
[SPEAKER_16]: Guys, it's not all about getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_16]: Please don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we're giggling and stuff,
but no.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we might have heard you,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you guys were cool over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's so relaxed in this place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's just on the couch is just
chilling.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the vibe in here right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some revolution playing in the
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard not to after two dozen
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kicking it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny, we cut you off on your story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: I needed butane.
[SPEAKER_16]: What dabber doesn't need butane?
[SPEAKER_16]: Not to blast dabs, but for my torches.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was on Hancock and Delta and I seen
Rasta colors and it said, pops,
[SPEAKER_16]: crops, gift shop.
[SPEAKER_16]: No red card needed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll sell butane, right?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_16]: I walk in the door and there's somebody on
a couch and it's not the Canna Canyon
[SPEAKER_16]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more like dab lounge, family joint
kind of vibe, bar room kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_16]: And a person on the couch goes,
you look familiar.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, yeah, I'm the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wasn't tooting my horn or anything.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I said, do you have butane?
[SPEAKER_16]: And the girl goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was kind of attitude with me.
[SPEAKER_16]: And she said, if I turn you on to a dab,
can I record it?
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_16]: So she's recording and she goes,
she says she's famous.
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope it was worth the wait.
[SPEAKER_16]: She dabs me, doesn't carve it and lifts
the damn joint off the pipe.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just go, peace.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not supposed to carve a nail.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you just lift the drop down right off
the nail, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just weird.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was very weird.
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't like me there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: She says she's famous.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, well, I didn't say I was famous.
[SPEAKER_16]: I said I was the dabbing granny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rude people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be rude to people, especially the
dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then somebody made a comment,
granny, don't go there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody was just killed in the parking
lot there last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you hate on a sweet lady who
brings a basket of awesome treats
[SPEAKER_10]: everywhere she comes?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got a basket of snacks over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only does she bring a basket of turfs,
she literally brings a basket of all candy
[SPEAKER_10]: greatness you could possibly think of.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, there's candy?
[SPEAKER_15]: Granny said there's always candy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is granny's basket right there of
goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: She brought a basket of snacks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were hard words for my brain to make
happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basket of snacks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good on a lollipop.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you though.
[SPEAKER_08]: You confused him.
[SPEAKER_13]: You really are my granny.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll eat some sugar babies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take one.
[SPEAKER_16]: How nostalgic are sugar babies?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Lindsay for bringing people
snacks and being awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to granny for bringing a basket
of snacks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Lindsay's shirt tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Chris for getting me this
shirt, actually.
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris has good taste.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay's blushing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never get to see Lindsay blush.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think she blushes when I said no one
else caught.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually really wanted to blush that day
in the car with the- All right,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got dabbing granny here on the
podcast with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to
[SPEAKER_15]: let him try to chew these real quick.
[SPEAKER_15]: While I stare down at Jeff and want to
know what this whole conversation is
[SPEAKER_15]: about.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know Lindsay over there is
giggling like no other.
[SPEAKER_15]: The conversation that happened in the car?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, inside joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the car.
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened to the car station?
[SPEAKER_08]: My car has now became Vegas.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to name my car Vegas.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to name my car Vegas.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was honestly just trying to make you
blush back just because- We did experience
[SPEAKER_08]: one thing in the car though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like it when the person in the
seat behind me tries to use a dab torch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got four foot long dreadlocks and
that freaked me the fuck out completely.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's funny because then on the last
podcast when someone was sitting behind me
[SPEAKER_12]: on the couch and they were using a torch
and I looked at you and I was like,
[SPEAKER_12]: okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, oh, I can just be a candle in
a minute here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, where are my dreads down?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there one of them loose?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have all of them still?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't smell burning hair.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now we have three dreads,
two, three non-dreads right here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Camille's over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's- Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Camille's over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're over to run.
[SPEAKER_15]: Team dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Team dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might have to convert.
[SPEAKER_12]: Might have to convert.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brandy, what are you doing right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to explain what's happening
to us?
[SPEAKER_16]: Sam, will you hold the mic to her face so
that she can- I am turping up.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's some viola shatter.
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the paper.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that comes from oil slick,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how I got to know oil slick.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I admired this beautiful shatter
paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to my friends at oil slick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Josh and the entire oil
slick.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_16]: I love Josh's mustache.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're nice people.
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so I got to know him because of
the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so some viola, which needs to be
kicked up a notch.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not real flavorful.
[SPEAKER_16]: So our good friend-
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like my second or third favorite
right there.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so distinguishable.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of my favorite flowers to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I don't enjoy the turps,
oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hits my tongue where it just,
it's overpowering to my tongue.
[SPEAKER_16]: What was the combination you had last week
that you was- It was the Durban poison on
[SPEAKER_08]: some shatter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what the shatter was,
but there's that licorice anise flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too overpowering within the turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: The flowers are amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the lemon G, the ghost train haze,
the OG Kush, the paradigms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever there's a berry was Zanberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ones you brought last week,
the ones you brought to secret sesh,
[SPEAKER_08]: loved every one of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Durban poison, my tongue doesn't agree
with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's a gorilla balloon number
four.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was trying to go quickly so that
Brett can talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to cut myself off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to get in there quick,
but I wanted to say first.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the kind of first- But shout
out to secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's why I'm kind of having issues
over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, which one do I talk into?
[SPEAKER_08]: So Granny is now taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got a healthy size dab there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's got to be, that's a good dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's point two, point two five.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to drop the turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got a little, are you just going to
pour it on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ballsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam's got a little, a small dram vial,
like a quarter dram vial of turpines.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just poured the turps directly onto
the dab and he nailed it like a freaking
[SPEAKER_08]: eliminated.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a beautiful- He would get a tap on
in the dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to,
I'm going to try to bring the,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the clear Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not mad at you for anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying that's- There's never
hate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, that's not my flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Granny grabbed the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is milky.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's capping it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like a champion over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: What?
[SPEAKER_13]: This is when you need the video.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: You should have saw that cloud that just
came out of her mouth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you should have just heard that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it was out of her- It shakes her head.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: It points at her nose.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's like, no, that didn't go out of my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_13]: It came out right out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people would be coughing by now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say that would have burned my
nose.
[SPEAKER_08]: She said she has tears in her eyes.
[SPEAKER_16]: But yum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tears but yum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, tears of yum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tears of turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turp tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turp tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that might be a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turp tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably like a point three dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to ask Granny how long she's been
consuming cannabis as soon as she quits
[SPEAKER_08]: choking on this mini dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Since she was 14.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did she say 14?
[SPEAKER_08]: But keep in mind that podcast never
happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm telling you since she was 14.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I know that actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lindsay is correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: A freshman in high school.
Come on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Granny trivia.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how some of my giveaways are trivia
like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think we actually just had the
conversation when you were at the shop
[SPEAKER_12]: last.
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was.
Why?
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I met another nice glass blower.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's shout him out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Bojangos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That dude deserves a shout out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Logan and Cody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, cloudy glass.
[SPEAKER_16]: They do a lot of periscopes.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you follow them on Periscope,
you'll see them blowing some glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The alerts is those guys on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_16]: They actually depend on their Periscope to
sell their artwork.
[SPEAKER_16]: So give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_16]: Such good resources.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love how social media, I'm sure Granny
makes a decent income off of the social
[SPEAKER_08]: media, whether it be glass or clothing or
whatever is sent to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you get a nice mailbox full of
stuff every month.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Lindsay, I know you do a whole bunch
of social media stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Chris and I met through social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how everything happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I became friends with Bobo
Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember I used to sit on the podcast
and he said you would giggle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure we became friends on
social media before we ever met.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I haven't found you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the podcast level you've been
putting out for a while.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, Brett, I'm going to shout Brett
out for being such a kind, loving person
[SPEAKER_16]: in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I jumped on the scene back in
November, I didn't know what the hell I
[SPEAKER_16]: was doing and none of you.
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, most people were like,
where the hell did this woman come from?
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have this note that Brett wrote me
with one of his first slaps, as the people
[SPEAKER_16]: call them, because you slap them up on
everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: His light bulb, Mary's motivation that
just encouraged me to keep being positive
[SPEAKER_16]: and silly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, Brett, just for kind of
saying, you know, stick with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I took a picture because I don't think
he believed that I really kept that letter
[SPEAKER_16]: for that long, but I have.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why I love Brett so much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like this is how positive and just happy
you always are.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like every time I see you,
you're never upset.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just, all right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say here's Terps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm, you know, like so positive all the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: His Instagram displays exactly that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys follow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Mary's underscore motivation or
Mary's motivation?
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary's underscore motivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow Mary's underscore motivation on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check him out in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: He takes a morning dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: He does a silly dance.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a dog.
[SPEAKER_16]: He can do hands and dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just about to say to you,
listen, I tried three times.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't have a rig that will like
yours right to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was so perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, dude, I'm never going to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, it was just perfect height.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I have tried the rig.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just looking at, I was stoned
looking at the rig and I was like,
[SPEAKER_15]: how can I take a funny day?
[SPEAKER_15]: And I looked at my Bob Marley poster on
the wall or tapestry on the wall.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, well, maybe I could do a
headstand and it'll reach right in my
[SPEAKER_15]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, and honestly, at first try,
I was like, honestly tried my first try
[SPEAKER_15]: and it worked.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happens when you think outside
the box and take too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have tried Brett.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to lie, but my ass will not
pop up over my head.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I asked grumpy grandpa, will you give
me a lift?
[SPEAKER_16]: And he said, you are not one of those 25
year old kids.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I will not help you do a handstand
dab.
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I help you do a handstand dab before
we leave tonight?
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we put some of these couch cushions?
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to back up on two things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grumpy grandpa.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'll tell you when I first started
doing dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to blow my nose, dab, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk for a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in love with the grumpy grandpa.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was like, have fun, but I don't want to
be on the camera.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I respected that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was like, well, what do you want
people to know you as?
[SPEAKER_16]: And he is like, well, just, just call me
grumpy grandpa.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was like, okay, bad it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of one to 10, how grumpy is
grandpa?
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, because he has such chronic pain
and chronic illness, some days he's pretty
[SPEAKER_16]: grumpy.
[SPEAKER_16]: But considering I've been with him since
1974 and he still makes me laugh every
[SPEAKER_16]: day, he's not that grumpy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true love.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one love and I have been alive
granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: He is, he is my life partner.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and it's good things and bad
things as every relationship is,
[SPEAKER_16]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that he watched out for you and
didn't let you do a handstand.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did not want to call 911 for his love
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, no, you're not going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just make it look like an upside
down dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got editing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got iMovie.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make something happen for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what state did you live in when you
started consuming cannabis at the age of
[SPEAKER_08]: 14?
[SPEAKER_16]: I am, and I was,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was in my 20s and I was in my 30s
and I was in my 40s.
I didn't know if I was in my 40s or 60s.
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: How hard was it for you to get some
cannabis when you lived in the corn?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was where they just growing cannabis up in
the corn also?
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I started meeting guys coming
back from the Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you told us about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's where it all started.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, I was exposed to first
cannabis and then many other things.
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And at this point in my life, I can truly
say with life experience, don't mess with
[SPEAKER_16]: that other shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, okay, you are all, you young folks
say you need your spiritual experiences
[SPEAKER_16]: with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_16]: I respect that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as far as like, man, that's poison.
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay away from that crap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, anything that anybody has to make,
stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that sounds contradictory because
we smoke turps, but we're extracting
[SPEAKER_08]: something from grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: The meth, you got to put it together.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So granny, granny meets these handsome
young man coming back from Vietnam and
[SPEAKER_08]: start smoking cannabis in Iowa,
out in the corn, raising hell being a
[SPEAKER_08]: youngster.
[SPEAKER_08]: When did you move to Colorado?
[SPEAKER_16]: I've lived here 24 years now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so you were here before the cannabis
revolution.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: But did I smoke cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, far before the revolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_16]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_16]: I lived in Europe before I came here.
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't have cannabis, but they had
hashish.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they didn't have a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, this has been a long time
ago and I'm telling things, I'm telling
[SPEAKER_16]: secrets, but I would every now and again
get my hands on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh boy, did the Europeans love American
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like-minded folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to, you can always find,
it's like we, if you get a new job,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you go to a new school, if you move to
a new town, if you go to a new whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you join, if you're an archery,
into archery, when you go to that new
[SPEAKER_08]: archery class, whatever it is,
if you're a glassblower, you walk in,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're a glassblower, everyone smokes,
bad example.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you walk into most places,
you can look around the room and be like,
[SPEAKER_08]: ah, that dude over there, he's a turpore
just like me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go hang out and kind of feel
the waters out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it's a break time, like,
so you want to go, uh, fucking get some
[SPEAKER_08]: 420 on and you can always just find the
like-minded potheads in the group.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's just because we put a vibe out
word.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a few haters in the community,
but you know, that's like every,
[SPEAKER_16]: every sect of life, you're going to have a
few bad people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for the most part, the people in the
cannabis community are happy people.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're loving people.
[SPEAKER_16]: Other human beings.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we love the earth.
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to respect it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we're all pretty, we're all
connected in that one way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, if we don't love it, if, if we don't
take care of the earth, we can't grow
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis makes us more peaceful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes us more connected.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes us easier to love each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever taken a big dab and been like,
fuck that person.
[SPEAKER_08]: You take a big dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, nah, it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're never angry as you're blowing out a
dab.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm never angry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, this is, think about
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can be angry at somebody, you know,
it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I heard that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you popping over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's piggy.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's popping his piggy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just keep moving.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause this is getting weird.
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, you're so angry at your
neighbor, whatever it's an anger is a
[SPEAKER_16]: pretty ugly emotion.
[SPEAKER_16]: Does your neighbor know?
[SPEAKER_16]: That it's eating you up?
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who's it hurting?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's renting space in your head for free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It isn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go talk to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny, you're awesome to have on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like some of the stuff you say.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said a second ago that you're telling
your dark secrets.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's something you've never shared with
anybody that you want to tell us here on
[SPEAKER_08]: the podcast?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to put you on the spot like that
because I want to know what you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: She just did the hand on the chin thing
and looked up at the sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say that I, obviously I've done a
lot in my life and I'm still alive and
[SPEAKER_16]: that amazes me when I think back at some
of the things I've done.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm destined, I'm destined to be here
right now as Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all destined to be right here,
right at this moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my favorite friends, even Sam,
the new guy, bro, I like your vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like what you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to hang out more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been going for almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time to do that thing where we talk
about everybody's social media connections
[SPEAKER_08]: and I thank everybody for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Dab and Granny, tell everybody how
everybody can find you on all the social
[SPEAKER_08]: media.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let them know about the YouTube,
Facebook, Instagram, everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'm dabbing underscore granny.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on Instagram, dabbing underscore
granny, Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on Facebook and I'm kind of liking
this live stream.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm streaming on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do great Facebook live videos.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just started doing that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have a lot of followers yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's only a few people and they like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll probably take a dab on Facebook live
as the end of this recording wraps up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll do it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: And obviously because I am the Dab and
Granny, I consume a large amount of
[SPEAKER_16]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to have a few sponsors.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to shout them out if that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was going to be the next thing I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_16]: First ones are Dabado.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know they take a lot of grief about
their product, but as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_16]: concerned, there's many of those portable
emails out there branded under many names.
[SPEAKER_16]: Any one of those companies could have come
and said, hey, we like you.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to help you.
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dabado did.
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Dabado.
[SPEAKER_16]: Ooze 420.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have pens.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have silicone things.
[SPEAKER_16]: They make exit bags, which you have to
have at every dispensary here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to be repping.
I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be repping.
I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be repping.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see me in an event, and I'm pretty
sure I can speak for everybody at this
[SPEAKER_08]: table, we're just people.
[SPEAKER_08]: We get thirsty when we wake up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a pee in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to take Dabs around six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want some food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where does normal people walk up and say
hi?
[SPEAKER_15]: If you do not say hi to me and you know
who I am, I will be very upset because I
[SPEAKER_15]: know eventually I will say what's up to
you.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you say the same thing I've said
and you've heard this and you say this
[SPEAKER_15]: thing, I'm like, yo bro, I've told you,
because this is me talking to you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people are shy.
[SPEAKER_15]: So come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's Dab?
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, that's obviously not that shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get that I am six, five, and I've got
dreadlocks down to almost my knees.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get that I could be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually got three or four people hanging
out with me.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're so well known in the industry
and you know what you're doing and you
[SPEAKER_15]: want to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you hear that deep radio voice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, what is behind that voice?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come say hello and I'll be your friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can take some Dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can take some selfies.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, one nine hundred Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Podcast voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: One nine hundred Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_16]: What's that kind of voice?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is this smooth Barry Manilow podcast
voice.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Barry Manilow.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what he turns on.
[SPEAKER_16]: He turns it on.
[SPEAKER_16]: Smash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Smash.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Smash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I posted this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Squash.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a swash?
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were in Jersey, it could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I posted to Facebook that I was setting
up to record a podcast with Davin Grani
[SPEAKER_08]: and someone on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first comment was y'all going to smash
after.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, what smash?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we do, there will be video and
we'll post it to Facebook and you guys
[SPEAKER_13]: will get to check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't sign up for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anyone in the room signed up
for that.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get paid enough for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grandpa is going to be upset.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Chris, you got a microphone in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell everybody your Instagram and or
Snapchat and or social medias.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also tell us a whole bunch about
burniture.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_10]: B-O-B-O Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_10]: You find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: My Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know my Snapchat now,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I might have it listed on my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like it on social media.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I was going to hear a whole
school of words.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_10]: too.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can find me that too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want some of your furniture.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the burniture, the burnitures.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a whole bunch of sweet little
furniture ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, not ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a whole bunch of products that are
available on burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically I make coffee tables and
tables.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have shelves.
[SPEAKER_10]: That with basically e-nails built into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you don't have to have a clumsy little
pod or cluster.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why he's not all over social media,
Ross.
[SPEAKER_16]: Jeff, he's too busy building quality
furniture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long ago did you give me my table?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was over a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we were just talking about the
other day on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it still works.
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still jamming.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was like an original, original one
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of beat up.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, you know, that means it's been
used.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just a decoration.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that was what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I'm happy I sent it to him
because that's what I sent it over to him
[SPEAKER_10]: for was to really get that, that work into
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was one of my first original ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the OG burniture table.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who really do I know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've seen who like really just dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Ross Jeff's that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I fully endorse burniture tables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in the Colorado Springs area,
we can get you locally.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in Pueblo, we can get you
locally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably get you taken care of in Denver
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll figure it out and get you a
burniture table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, we'll ship them to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like, also, I do like custom stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have stuff on like ideas you want
to come to me, like, yeah, you want Peli
[SPEAKER_10]: cases, you want game consoles,
anything you have like random ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have kids that come to me like,
Hey, put this in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably put it in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me a pair of shoes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could probably put it in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a portable, really on the go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just coming out of the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should not talk like that, but we were
making a joke for camping, for camping.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're stuck in traffic between
Denver and Springs for an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_08]: and you move 10 feet because there's a
wreck up there and nobody cares if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: taking a dab or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you're not going to drive for an
hour anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't I take a dab officer?
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, yeah, you just definitely gave
white Mike a panic attack while he's
[SPEAKER_12]: listening to this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was so unfair of him.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike is like, Oh my God, he's talking
about, Oh my, Oh my, Oh my, I need to take
[SPEAKER_12]: a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes the traffic is horrendous,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubba, thanks for making the killer
burniture table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you always for the love.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you always for letting me on here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so great coming out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love meeting all you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam was awesome meeting you and it was
wonderful meeting you.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is such a great, awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great to be in Canyon Canyon,
have Canyon Canyon, stuff like this,
[SPEAKER_10]: to be able to have and be able to meet so
many people at once.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Canyon is a great place.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys in states that are passing
legalization for medical, please keep in
[SPEAKER_16]: mind, do not go strictly wreck.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's people that really truly
need medical, please bring them here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, you need places to gather and
consume.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have people that have leases that they
can't medicate in their own apartment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Where are they going to go?
[SPEAKER_16]: You need places like this.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have learned here in Colorado,
so listen to us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to help you.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not being arrogant.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just put some forethought in a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny's completely right.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Colorado, we messed up when we wrote
the bills here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not include consumption areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a gray area.
[SPEAKER_08]: These places can be shut down at any time.
[SPEAKER_08]: This Canna Canyon, where we are allowed to
sit here at this table and gather
[SPEAKER_08]: peacefully and take some dabs and have a
podcast together, this could be stopped at
[SPEAKER_08]: any moment with just a letter.
[SPEAKER_08]: All that would have to be done is a letter
written and a judge says, no more,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it could be over.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you do get around to writing the
legalization bills in your state,
[SPEAKER_08]: make sure you include these types of
places.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you put so many of these places
available in so much locality and write
[SPEAKER_08]: rules for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you don't write rules,
when it comes to make rules for cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization in your area, the rules will
be written for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they make the rules for you,
you get really fucked.
[SPEAKER_08]: They say, okay, nothing then.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you let them write the rules,
they don't give you shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you make the rules yourself,
you can have experienced people on there
[SPEAKER_08]: that understand what this community wants
and needs, and it can be done
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage you, be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you get the social clubs and the
legislation.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the time comes and the time is now,
start doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember people, knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_16]: We got to keep this cannabis army on the
march.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because we're getting recreation
illegal in some places doesn't mean we can
[SPEAKER_08]: get lazy with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: The beautiful Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris's better half.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lovely red dreads.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like you cleaned up a little bit
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give a little buzz on there on the sides.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to get a haircut.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was getting bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take the little fillies off.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually like it better short like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little airflow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you lollipop your head a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure most of our listeners know how to
find you by now, but remind everybody all
[SPEAKER_08]: of your social media connections.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my Instagram is the Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_12]: My Snapchat is Traveling Stoner without
the G.
[SPEAKER_12]: My Twitter is the Travel Stoner and my
Periscope is the Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are one Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any brands you need to shout
out or anybody that is sponsoring you that
[SPEAKER_08]: you need to support while you're on here?
[SPEAKER_12]: Another shout out to Starfire Edibles for
sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Jazz is just the bomb.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't speak highly enough of her.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dank Essence, CBD infused bath bombs
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bath bombs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a reason for a dude to use a bath
bomb?
[SPEAKER_16]: You might like them actually.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a product test them, so don't judge
a guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you make one of the videos like all
the girls do?
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a product test them that we made at
our company.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I thought you meant a Dank Essence
one.
[SPEAKER_15]: I gave some to my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_15]: Dank Essence?
[SPEAKER_15]: Not Dank Essence, another bath bomb
though.
[SPEAKER_15]: Girls love them.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think actually I've tried many of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: I do like Dank Essence because they are
high in CBDs.
[SPEAKER_16]: To me, okay,
[SPEAKER_16]: old school I used to just soak with some
Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I use these bath bombs and they work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Young men of Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You dab dudes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're sitting on the couch on a fucking
Saturday taking dabs, watching Dab and
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny do videos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go do her yard work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go mow her lawn for her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go pick up the trash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go pick up the leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hit her up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Say Dab and Granny, I'm going to come
clean your front lawn because Ross and
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff said so and I'm a respectful young
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no need for you to be out there
cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're too awesome to be out there
cleaning shit up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some young man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You ain't doing shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get up off the couch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go help out the Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that, go help out someone
else's granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clean up some fucking leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Clean up their yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Help somebody out.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I always end my YouTubes
[SPEAKER_16]: ever and do a kind deed for somebody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see no reason to not end this podcast on
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're all going to do a mic drop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone else is kind of like, fucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fox just called in on FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody put your mic up to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't hear him from here.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know I want to meet you so- Oh,

[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fox just happens to call right as we're
