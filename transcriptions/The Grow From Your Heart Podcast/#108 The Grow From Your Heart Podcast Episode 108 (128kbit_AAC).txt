[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, Rasta Jeff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I start the podcast, I want to send
love and respect to all of the victims of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Planned Parenthood shooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to send a huge thank you
to all of the law enforcement that helped
[SPEAKER_01]: rescue those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 108 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_01]: letting me use their music on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also you guys, this podcast is brought to
you by our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Glass, made in America by
Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm shopping for a new rig,
I like to know that what I'm paying for is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give me a nice fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always rely on Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trust your dab to a rig made in
China by a Chinese child without proper
[SPEAKER_01]: eye protection or adequate pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy yourself some glass made in America by
folks who dab as hard as you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Glass is not only a glass company,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Dougie is a huge part of the
cannabis hash movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support Hitman Glass and be sure to check
out the Chalice Festival in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go follow Hitman Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search for Hitman Glass Dougie and give
them a follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be sure to visit HitmanGlass.com
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, tonight as we record,
I'm hitting my Hitman E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first Hitman rig and I have
been impressed since my first rip out of
[SPEAKER_01]: any Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hitman Glass and Dougie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can remember the first time I
hit a Hitman rig, I hit a Hitman Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my homie Hank, we may have been in
his car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know nothing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But big shout out to my buddy Hank for
introducing me to the world of Hitman
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not looked back since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I know everybody likes a nice
custom rig, a nice colorful rig made by
[SPEAKER_01]: some fancy artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always great to have in your
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you pay a bunch of money and
you go to hit that rig and when you put
[SPEAKER_01]: water in it, the first time you go to draw
through it, you get water in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you try to take a dab,
you get water in your mouth because the
[SPEAKER_01]: water level has to be just at this awkward
level to where when you hit it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get water in your mouth or you can put
a little less water and not get any
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That never happens with a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a Hitman rig, it is always
going to hit like a fucking truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's quit rambling about glass and let's
take a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're gonna hit the Hitman E-Series
Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a highly educated domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna heat this sucker up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do it old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna use a torch and not use the
E-nail today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting in a different location,
so I don't have the E-nail right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm heating this nail up, getting it
nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna take a dab together and then
we're gonna get on with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, I hope you've got a dab
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope wherever you are or whatever you're
doing, you're smoking something tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dab, you guys, goes out to Hitman
Glass and the entire Hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first rig and I love the way
it hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first Hitman rig and I love the way it
hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am carb capping and freestyle rapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I've got a whole bunch of stuff
that I wanna talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get down to business a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to mention that my Instagram
account, the iRiGenetics Instagram account
[SPEAKER_01]: was at 19,000 followers and Instagram shut
that thing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big middle finger to Instagram for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would like you to do is follow my
new account.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's iRi underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a new account going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been posting a few pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got close to a thousand followers
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse my cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please go support the new iRiGenetics
Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're out to get the
entire cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I read today was as long as you don't
post pictures of yourself using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can post pictures of your plants and
of your rigs and of your hash and of your
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't post pictures of yourself
smoking is what somebody tried to tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse my coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems true because the accounts that
are getting deleted are people smoking and
[SPEAKER_01]: the accounts that are still there,
they don't have images of them smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna try to stick with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just be posting pictures of plants,
pictures of me at work, pictures of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, but I won't be posting dab
videos and dab pictures to Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, make sure you follow the new
iRiGenetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to send a huge shout out to
my friend Seb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you want me to say your
whole name on the podcast, but big shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to my friend Seb from Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been talking about the
donation button on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the website,
iRiGeneticsColorado.com, go to the podcast
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a PayPal button on the top right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a donation button.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every donation you make goes directly
to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, our friend Seb from Australia
sent me a nice donation and I really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to give you a huge thank you shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to make a contribution,
I would definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a big old shout out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be your Facebook friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so big shout out to our buddy
Seb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super awesome of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I super appreciate the contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, one more thing to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode number 106, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put up episode number 106 a couple of
weeks ago and Stitcher failed to grab the
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not play on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, it has been fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are a Stitcher listener,
you can go back and listen to episode
[SPEAKER_01]: number 106.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of an important episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hang out with me, if you listen to
me and you feel like we're buddies since
[SPEAKER_01]: we've become podcast friends, episode
number 106 is kind of important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you a little bit about what's
going on in my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should listen if you have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is available on Stitcher now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of stuff I want to
cover you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody knows I quit the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't, when you listen to
episode number 106, you will learn that
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's part of what 106 is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer work at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now part of the green and healthy
wellness team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the lead cultivator for the green and
healthy wellness gardens in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my boy, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got trust and faith in me and
understands that I am able to run this
[SPEAKER_01]: large garden by myself and produce the
quality of cannabis that they expect on
[SPEAKER_01]: their shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much respect to the green and healthy
team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me get back to what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit the spot recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't working for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing personal against the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any plants yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a pot grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I needed to be growing and that wasn't
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the spot held a contest or maybe a
raffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really a contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they did was anybody who spent over
$50 in purchases got their name entered
[SPEAKER_01]: into a raffle to win two tickets to the
Grateful Dead concert at the First Bank
[SPEAKER_01]: Center just a couple of nights ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't actually the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called themselves Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's most of the members of the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bass player and the lead guitar
player and the keyboard player are new
[SPEAKER_01]: guys because, well, the guitar player is
dead, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Garcia has been dead for several
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had John Mayer, of all people,
replace him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Oteal Burbridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Replace the bass player because Phil Lesh
is out with bladder cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know anything about the
Grateful Dead, you know that they just
[SPEAKER_01]: have an issue with keyboard players.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their keyboard players seem to die for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time they had Jeff Cimenti on
keyboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while the spot had this raffle,
anybody that spent $50 could win these
[SPEAKER_01]: tickets by being entered into a raffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our good friend Sloppy, who has been here
on the podcast, actually won the Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy didn't put down his phone number or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He simply wrote Sloppy on the raffle
ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our good friend Mike is the manager
over at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike called me and he said, hey,
bro, Sloppy won these Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get a hold of him?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I texted Sloppy and I said,
hey, bro, you won these Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sloppy said, cool, take those tickets
and have fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sloppy, the man, my homie, Sloppy,
what's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy threw me two free Grateful Dead
tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to go see the Grateful Dead on,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to go see this version of the
Grateful Dead on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's great because I quit the
spot a week ago and I'm still getting
[SPEAKER_01]: perks and hookups from the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the spot for the free
Grateful Dead tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a super huge shout out to my boy
Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I told him I had Grateful Dead
tickets, he didn't even hesitate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, those are yours, go have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good bumping into you over at the
Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a big shout out to Rachel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun watching you blow some big old
vape clouds through the whole show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I got to go see the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's kind of neat that the job
I quit a week ago, kind of in a roundabout
[SPEAKER_01]: way, gave me free tickets to go see the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was ironic in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Grateful Dead, holy crap,
that was such a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at a whole new level of playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is refreshed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it a minute ago and you guys
probably scratched your head and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: John Mayer plays for the Grateful Dead
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years ago, John Mayer did something
stupid and I don't pay a lot of attention,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he said something stupid somewhere and
it messed up his musical career and people
[SPEAKER_01]: did not like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he kind of took a little hiatus and
went away for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while he was finding himself,
he discovered the Grateful Dead and
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered the Grateful Dead music and the
way of the dead and the community and
[SPEAKER_01]: really got into it and somehow ended up
playing guitar for the Grateful Dead now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: At first I was skeptical because John
Mayer is not my style of music at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like girl music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like teenage music in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I know I'm a prick because I'm
really judgmental about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to say, when I saw John Mayer
playing with the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: he nails it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets it perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does everything exactly the way it
should be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: His tone is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does not overplay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude knows how to play a guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can sing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sang a few tunes and they sounded
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys get a chance to go see any
Grateful Dead shows, if you're a Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead fan, I definitely recommend you go
check it out and get there early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the lot scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Gibbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took Gibbs with me to the Grateful Dead
show and we had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen Gibbs in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a wonderful time hanging out
with my brother Gibbs at the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the entire Deadhead family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep moving on with the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm really rambly today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you guys are into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an event coming up on the next
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows that I bred this strain of
weed for the love of my friend Dude It's
[SPEAKER_01]: Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the manager at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an alternative model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her Instagram pictures will put a
smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did breed a strain of cannabis for
our friend Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are having an official tasting
party at the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational
[SPEAKER_01]: on the 4th and 5th of next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do my best to record with Damsel
and get a little bit of that onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're going to do is we're going
to have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got 10 jars in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to crack one open right now just
for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 10 jars of herb that I grew for the
lovely Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a little tasting
party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Miss Damsel is going to decide which
of these phenotypes gets to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: selection that will take the name of
Damsel's Dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will get a clone into the shop
and we will start growing Damsel's Dank at
[SPEAKER_01]: Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be available on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a little while, but we'll get it
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole world with a medical card
will be able to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully eventually Colorado Springs will
wake up and start allowing recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way we can make Damsel's Dank
available to the entire world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Hunt for putting me in
touch with Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a huge shout out to the lovely
dude at Damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Britt, thanks for giving me the honor
of being the breeder chosen to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand how important this is to you
and I'm going to get it right for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing I want to do is a little
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be a very simple lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching a Facebook argument the
other day and people were arguing over a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant being male or female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought I'd just come on here and
just make it really clear and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about what a male and a
female plant look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes time to determine the sex of
your plants, there are a few ways you can
[SPEAKER_01]: go about doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main way that you can do it is to just
flower your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant and you put it under
1212, which is 12 hours on and 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: off of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need full darkness in your dark
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you need complete darkness
uninterrupted for 12 full hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see anything in that room in
the dark cycle, it is too bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to make it darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any light, it's not dark
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not considered dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face, it is too light in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only lights that you can have in a
grow room during the dark cycle are green
[SPEAKER_01]: LED lights or those green coiled
fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need green light in your dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green lighting during the flowering cycle
does not interrupt the flowering photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period because the plants are green and
they do not absorb green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by putting any plant into the 1212
period, you will actually induce the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about 10 to 14 days ish,
you'll be able to tell if your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: male or female by signs that it shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about those here in just a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, you can flower a plant at
any size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how big it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen is it's going to
flower when you put it into 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to make it flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I always recommend is that you
take a clone from every seed that you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start a plant from seed,
please take a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, you might be growing the
most amazing strain anybody has ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be the perfect medicinal strain for
the every, for everybody on the planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the entire population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could cure every element.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't take a clone,
oh, you're going to be so mad at yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there's one strain that I grew
that got away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not get it to clone and it was
some of the best cannabis I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a little mad at myself that I
couldn't get it to clone, but I do have
[SPEAKER_01]: more seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I can find that phenotype
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, when you grow, so grow a plant
from seed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put it under 1212 and it will
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always recommend taking a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a plant that has grown for
a little while and you've got a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either flower out that original
plant that has been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you've got a little bit of
product to show for yourself and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got something to smoke and make it worth
your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can flower out that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as that clone that you took starts
showing roots, you can switch that light
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1212 and that clone will flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 10 to 14 days, you'll have a little
tiny plant with either male or female
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be able to tell if you've got a
boy or a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, you can either throw
away that male plant that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the bigger pot, or you can put
that female plant into the flowering room
[SPEAKER_01]: and start making buds out of it,
or keep it as a mother plant and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: taking clones off of it and have that
strain around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take clones, you guys, and then you can
either clone that original clone or flower
[SPEAKER_01]: that original clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it roots out and then you can see what
you've got, or you can flower that
[SPEAKER_01]: original plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, it's going to do the same
thing and you will know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please take a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stress that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also, you guys, the plants will show
sex if you let them pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave a plant in a pot for long
enough to where it feels like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to get root bound and it's
reached its space, its space constraints
[SPEAKER_01]: in that pot, it will actually start to
flower on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some genetics will just panic and start to
flower on their own that way and they will
[SPEAKER_01]: show you what is called a pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the plant showing you that
it's reaching maturity, that it is ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to go, that its hormones are built up,
that it wants you to switch the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So simply waiting for the plant to
pre-flower is a good way to determine if
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a male or a female,
but then you do waste a lot of light and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of nutrients and a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a productive gardener,
sometimes you just can't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I recommend cutting a clone and
flowering out that little clone and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier to waste a little bit of
time under a fluorescent light than it is
[SPEAKER_01]: to waste time under that big thousand watt
high pressure sodium lamp where you could
[SPEAKER_01]: have been running a useful crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take some clones, flower them out,
see what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it feels like it's time to talk
about what to look for when your plants do
[SPEAKER_01]: start flowering so that you can tell if
you've got boys or girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I'm going to call it an
intersection, but at a node where the two
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes separate, you've got your main stock
coming up and then you've got the little
[SPEAKER_01]: intersection where a branch comes off to
the left and a branch comes off to the
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right about there, your plants are either
going to grow bald or hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that sounds really general,
but that's the most simple way to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either going to get a pair of balls
growing out right there at that
[SPEAKER_01]: intersection, or you are going to get
little hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see two little hairs sticking up,
those are your female plant parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are actually the parts that if you
were to spread pollen in the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollen would land on those little
pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are called pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those pistols would slide the pollen
up into the ovule, which would absorb the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen, which would then pollinate your
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got those little hairs,
you have got girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got those balls, you've got male
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you plan on making some seeds
and doing some breeding, it is time to get
[SPEAKER_01]: those boy plants out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, if you're listening to this
lesson and you're learning about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine sex, please do not breed
cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please learn a lot more about plants
before you breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll touch on that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to remember to mention why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see balls, get those plants out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's a good hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plants, I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been breeding plants for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing plants for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I really notice is the male
plants grow much, much taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that's just taken
off, it's just getting really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a real thick, fibrous stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just count on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get so excited that you've got this
one plant that grows like a son of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is probably a son of that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to get rid of that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you flower it, you will know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull the males as soon as you can,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got male and female plants
flowering next to each other, by day 14,
[SPEAKER_01]: that male plant is getting ready to drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them drop pollen around two
weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second to third week, that male plant
is really going to start spitting out his
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your female plants are going to be just
ready to take pollen at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to end up with a seeded
crop if you don't pay attention and get
[SPEAKER_01]: those boys out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave those boys in too long,
they'll seed up the entire room very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes one quick little pass of the
fan to spread that pollen through the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got a pollinated crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got seeds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the males out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be diligent about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay on top of that shit and get those out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels like I've talked enough about
male plants and how to identify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about
hermaphrodites because hermaphrodites can
[SPEAKER_01]: really confuse a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, hermaphrodites can confuse an
experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hermaphrodite is, and there are a lot of
words for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear people call it a hermy or a
herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hermaphrodite, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a plant that has both male and
female sexes and it will show them
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully very early in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, sometimes you don't see it
until like week eight on a nine week plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it starts showing a little pollen
sack and then you're like, gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, I got to cut this plant or I got to
pick this pollen sack out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start panicking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see a plant with male and female
parts coming out of it during flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've probably got yourself a
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes this happens in regular
breeding and it often happens in feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that just happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people try to hate on feminized
seeds for hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: If feminized seeds are made correctly,
they will not be hermaphrodites,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be good seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten more hermaphrodites from
regular seeds than I have from feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a breeder and I run a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame it on the feminized seeds at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is just something that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get males, you get females,
and you get hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole goal of this plant, its whole
goal is to reproduce itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horny plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horny male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horny girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to find another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make seeds so that the seeds
can drop into the ground and those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: can happen again next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole plant's goal is to just
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it will do whatever it's got to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of its fail safe backup plans is to
become a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that that can be a trait that is
just in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be in the DNA of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant can be born as a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes hermaphrodites are caused by
environment or mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you interrupt the dark cycle during the
flowering period, I talked earlier about
[SPEAKER_01]: how you have to have that complete 12-12
photo period with 12 hours of complete
[SPEAKER_01]: uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you interrupt that, you will cause your
plants to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you open up that door and left that
light on for six hours during one dark
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, you will start to see male flowers
pop up in your female flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it happen and you will have a
seeded plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the kind of thing that can cause
hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the Kim Dog and Kush strains,
if you push them too hard with nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: or just give them a little bit of stress
somehow, if they get bugs or powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew, they'll hermaphrodite on you just
in a survival method.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that that plant wants to
do just to make sure that it gets to carry
[SPEAKER_01]: on with its race.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wants to keep going on with its
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermaphrodites can be really confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit does happen like that in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your job as a grower to be aware of
it and to learn how to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see pollen sacks and pistols on
the same plant, you've probably got a
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not worth keeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get rid of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how good it looks, no matter how
sweet it smells, that plant needs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if your plant is well into the
flowering cycle and you've got big old
[SPEAKER_01]: chunky buds and you're starting to see
these pollen sacks come up, these little
[SPEAKER_01]: male flowers, they look like little
bananas, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like maybe a piece of rice
or just it's a little tiny, tiny,
[SPEAKER_01]: micro-sized banana popping up out of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little male pollen sack,
this little male flower coming out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, that stuff will happen late in
flower, somewhere between week seven and
[SPEAKER_01]: nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're past week seven or past,
yeah, I'd say past week seven and you see
[SPEAKER_01]: those, you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time before week seven, you guys,
if I see that shit, that plant is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just murder it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got availability to more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got access to seeds and clones like
you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a little picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid to euthanize a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes shit just has to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't work for my grow room,
sometimes a certain plant and your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, that's called a phenotypical
expression, the plant will express that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is not happy with your environment and it
won't work for you and you just got to get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of that plant and grow a different
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you start seeing those bananas
popping up around weeks, six or seven or
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, you have a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're popping up around week nine,
it's not that bad because you've only got
[SPEAKER_01]: a few days left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants are going to go about nine,
maybe 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that you're ending
up week seven and you start seeing little
[SPEAKER_01]: nanners popping up, you want to figure out
if you want to keep that plant going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth risking the rest of the
garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those little bananas are sterile
and they don't produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes one of those can rupture and it
will pollinate the plant that that banana
[SPEAKER_01]: is on and it will pollinate the plants all
around that plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it can pollinate the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it doesn't take much pollen to
create seeds and so now you'll have seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to try to eliminate the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to risk it or do you want to
try to get rid of those bananas?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do to those little male
flowers, you can mist them with water
[SPEAKER_01]: because water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just mist the plant with water and then
get some tweezers and pluck out those
[SPEAKER_01]: little bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're around week eight, week nine,
just pluck those out if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in week nine, just leave it
there and don't touch it until you harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: and you should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's popping up in week nine,
it's probably sterile, but sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: scary and you don't want to risk it around
week seven or week eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to pluck them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you have a decision to make,
but if you're a breeder, do not ever breed
[SPEAKER_01]: with a plant that'll make a hermaphrodite,
a little pop up, a little male plant
[SPEAKER_01]: around week seven, eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that because then you're going to
breed that hermaphroditic trait into
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you pull out the
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a decision you're going to have to
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to happen at some point in
your grow career.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a female plant popping
up a male flower in week eight and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to panic, but don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either pluck out that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let it grow or you can just
destroy the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always turn those seeded plants
into really good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think plants that are allowed to seed
make better hash than plants without
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get as much hash sometimes,
but I think that the high is better once
[SPEAKER_01]: you allow the plants to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only know that because I breed and
sometimes when I breed, there's material
[SPEAKER_01]: leftover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most of the time when I breathe,
there's material leftover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to separate the seeds from the
actual bud and we will run the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: material and turn it into BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the seeded BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no seeds in the BHO, but I mean,
it comes from seeded materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds are removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we run the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds are packaged and grown and then
the material is turned into hash and that
[SPEAKER_01]: hash seems to get me a little bit better
of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked earlier about new growers not
breeding and hermaphrodites are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me touch on why I said, please don't
breed if you're a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding takes a very selective eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to understand what plants you're
putting together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're putting a plant,
a plant needs to be properly tested before
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have talked about how I stress test a
plant before I'll breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a girl plant and I will try to
piss that plant off the best I can and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what it takes to make that plant
hermaphrodite or die or stress or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make sure it's not going to herm on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, I make sure that the
progeny, the offspring, the seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: come from that female plant, I make sure
that they're not going to hermaphrodite on
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have a plant, you have to
stress the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a properly selected male.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eye for a male selection is a skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan to have a conversation with other
breeders on this show about male
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll give you a heads up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But selecting a male is definitely a
special skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selecting plants for breeding is a,
it's a skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not experienced with the
plants you're using, you may breed some
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit and then you're going to have a
bunch of seeds and you're going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds out and you're going to grow
those bullshit seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to, the whole idea of
breeding cannabis is to improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, to improve the race,
to make the plant better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're breeding bullshit into it,
you're just watering it down and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading genetics that are a waste of
time, that are a waste of people's garden
[SPEAKER_01]: space when they could have been growing
some usable medicine that would have
[SPEAKER_01]: worked for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not dissing any new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just asking you, please don't try to
breed until you're a little more familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to listen to a podcast and
learn how to sex your plants, then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not ready to breed and I'm just being
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're ready to breed,
I'll be here to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to get rid of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to grow and then we'll learn how
to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to learn to ride the bike before
you can do wheelies, brah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I've been going on for about
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went 29 minutes and I didn't even make
any notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't look at the clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys enjoy listening to that
little lesson on how to sex your ganja
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
