[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you guys, but I've been
walking around singing No Belt Nebraska
[SPEAKER_01]: for like a week now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been stuck in my head for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Belt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only downfall is they used a lot
of inside jokes, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they tried to explain them to the best
of the ability, but it's more one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you had to bend there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just laughing every time they would
say something like Ham Wallet or some shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ham Wallet in the beginning was,
it got pushed off like it wasn't anything
[SPEAKER_00]: offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was letting shit just slide by because
the more I was like, ah shit, the more it
[SPEAKER_01]: came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fun to do, but it was fun just
letting some shit slide too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would hear one of them,
like everyone throughout the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you edit this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were like, no, no, I just,
I'm too lazy for that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recorded three hours with those guys and
I just cut out an hour and 20 right out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started playing No Belt Nebraska and
I was like, I'm going to record from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are getting recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know I had been recording for
like a full hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like you guys don't realize I've
been recording for at least a minute now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys ready to do a podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to drop in the intro song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 60 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I have to send a huge big thank
you shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to say thanks for letting me use
their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big huge thanks to Cat Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hanging out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Mike and Adam at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you boys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm DTFO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dab the fuck out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been dabbing on some TURPEX shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got some Black Cherry Kim shatter
from the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, what day is it that you're not
dab the fuck out though?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, um, early in the day early in the
early in the Merlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are, I surprisingly don't dab early
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an early morning dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to wait until I at least get a few
things done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, I've come over here a couple
of times and it's like seven, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, first one of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do work before you dab out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get, uh, if I dab too early,
I get lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to go right back to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I dab during work,
when I'm trying to get a lot of shit done,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get out of focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do the same thing to myself,
a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try to wait and reward yourself a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I grateful dog right after breakfast,
like it's going to be a real productive
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Mitch Shinasu, shout out Mitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, that when you're dabbing every
hour becomes 45 minutes of productive
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I kind of believe him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would argue with that between sativa and
innika.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're a real big sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually if I come over here and get
real ripped off sativa dabs, I don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: home and like, no, I'm like, what can we
clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, where do we need to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of get that way, but I ended up
doing some useless shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something that didn't even need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: My desk is organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the dishes are perfectly clean in the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have been doing way different
stuff at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a good sativa though, the spring
clean that just happened at my house would
[SPEAKER_02]: not have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: True that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of stuff got extra attention that it
definitely didn't deserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of my books didn't need to be
pulled out and dusted and put back on a
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf, but it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that's the shit that some dabs will do
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little too much sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I catch myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a dab and then I don't know how
I do it, but I'm on Instagram suddenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm standing just in the middle of all
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the middle of a hallway or in the
middle of the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are just flowing around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just Instagramming like a
motherfucker and don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what was going on here in my head a
minute ago and what am I supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't dab during the day sometimes,
but when I do bro, I dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I start dabbing, it's game on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta keep your dabs per hour high
once you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs per hour DPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, we're going to talk about,
I've got some news articles I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: read.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about some Jamaican
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to mention something about
ladybugs that a listener emailed me about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have time, I might talk about my
Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how far we're going to get
with all the news articles that I found.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do want to mention,
it's our birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 60 is the one year anniversary of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering when this was actually
going to come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how you were going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be out like March 29th,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think today, the 28th is the day
that the first episode was ever released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take some dabs for the birthday
and then we'll read some commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you guys the option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Gorilla Glue and I've got
Lemonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one should we dab here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know that I'm going to pitch
towards the SFV because it is a dank
[SPEAKER_00]: strain from Turpex.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said Lemonade and my tongue did a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I haven't tasted yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that by the end of the show,
we're going to dab all three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV and then we got to give Mike a little
baby dabs, but we'll start with the SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the San Fernando Valley Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really popular from the Cali
connection is who put out the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but people are going to be like,
they didn't make it popular, but they put
[SPEAKER_01]: out the seeds of the SFV and it's a great
breeding strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super nice high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpex blasted, extracted this and
everything Turpex does is quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed their labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like their new logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check out their new website.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been driving around in my car and
just randomly, like I've got Tourette's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, no melt Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the past seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife has no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she has no idea what it is,
but she's definitely heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every time I'm sitting in there
hitting the bowl, it just, it comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: whether there's no melt or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got maybe another day before I get
the dead pan look from mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pause the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain what the fuck are they talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the eighth time I've heard this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was setting up for the podcast,
I was reading a news article and Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: just, I'm going to give you a listen and
hit play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what are you giving me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's playing the no melt theme song in
the intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuck in my head, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to, you got to play it to get it
out of your head, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You download it to your phone,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be, is that song number three
on your phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know your playlist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like most of the episodes of the
podcast and then I have that new Afro man
[SPEAKER_02]: cut because I got high because that's
just, that's the only song on your phone,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put some order back to this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SFV we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me cough a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes really, it's earthy,
cushy, maybe a hint of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a good, nice earthy, cushy
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made my eyes go and it made me get a
little slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to smoke a sativa here
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I'm interested in this
lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new favorite turpex drink and at least
this run this time, I smoked quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of SFV between the water hash and what the
buddies, what my buddies smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last, I got four grand, I got four
flavors last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the lemonade, I got the chem dog,
the gorilla glue and the one I got was the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem and G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that chem and G was, it's gone now,
if that tells you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my favorite, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that nectar was good then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, it was definitely delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor on it was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor on this is pretty killer too,
but the flavor on that chem and stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I noticed through this,
like, I mean, I didn't just hack off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and it wasn't a huge dab,
but this and it made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was yeah, I'm nice and mellow now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have heavy eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that I don't get the eye high
from dabs like I used to when I would
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke just flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean red or?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when your eyes just get droopy
and they just feel like fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day, dude, your eyes would
just get so heavy and everyone would look
[SPEAKER_01]: at you and be like, you're so high,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs seem to make me bug eyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's so intense that I'm like,
I'm on edge with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of miss the eye high and I'm
getting that from this SFV right now.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I'm dabbed out of shit, did
everybody get a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got one right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not coughing, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Appropriately sized dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's got to take dabs for ants over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been rambling for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to do two commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's going to... Shout out to
Bernie, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at Hygro and or Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygro and or Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit the Denver store, 6271 Beach Street
or check out the Pueblo location,
[SPEAKER_01]: 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to Hygro and or Growing
Supplies, when you're checking out,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell them, I listen to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to give you commercial
pricing on everything you purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pay the same amount that I
pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pay what Adam pays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pay what Mike pays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pay what Jesse pays and
Jesse works there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a better discount than Jesse gets
and he's the manager at the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be honest, like you don't
need a discount there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the best price thing in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you part of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said we are part of the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just I think we all kind of are
part of Hygro because we all love Bern and
[SPEAKER_01]: Bern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's my brother, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's our brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Bern's a young lady who weighs like
100 pounds and they get a truck dropped
[SPEAKER_01]: off and they just throw the truck out
there and they're like, here's all your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, Bern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we all love her and we will all
grab a pile of soil or whatever we can
[SPEAKER_01]: move for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we are all part of team Hygro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can call us that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Community is what I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they let us have our meetings back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next Grow meeting, April 26,
that Hygro indoor growing supplies,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the meeting will start at six o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have something prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will speak about something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it'll be yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse and I will collaborate and talk
about what needs to be discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got an idea and you're coming to
the meeting, let me know what you'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: me to talk about at the Grow meeting,
April 26, that Hygro indoor growing
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about that more in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep reminding you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like at the last Grow meeting,
like a lot of stuff was talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: pretense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it came down to who's got
any questions, everybody was maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little embarrassed to speak up in front of
the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because you're in a community of
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that should be the place
to be embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the place to get help.
[SPEAKER_00]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody wanted to show that there were
yellow belts when there were fifth degree
[SPEAKER_01]: black belts in the room.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of talent there, it would have
been rough to be the first kid to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a silly question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence recommended that we write down
questions and put them in a hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way nobody knows who brought us
that silly-ass question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one of these dudes doesn't know how
to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but we've got to treat them as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole reason we're meeting is to
spread knowledge to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had training wheels at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic portions of this episode are
sponsored by my great friends at the Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Worm Company.

[SPEAKER_01]: Shake their hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be cool with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are community members of the Grow
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hype on that stuff is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hype is real, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has the, excuse my coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has the privilege of taking my old
soil out of the pot and putting it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the recycling bin for soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a serious privilege, bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deer Tay mover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to play with dirt all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see, in the past 20 years,
how many pots that we have harvested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen a massive increase in my
root mass?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of root material in these pots
is insane lately, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been breaking up dirt pots for as
fucking disgustingly long of my time now
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody's been breaking up an old
pot and had like a handful of little tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: sad ass root there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lately you've got to smash the root
ball against a wall for a little bit just
[SPEAKER_02]: to get some dirt back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not in there any longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to say, well, you just let
them grow more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're actually in there shorter
because I ran this crop really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to get some pictures of the crop
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just an insane amount of
incredibly healthy root material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, that's kind of what I was
pointing at is like, if you're using that,
[SPEAKER_00]: would it be better to kind of transplant
more, you know, more often or just
[SPEAKER_00]: because?
[SPEAKER_01]: A larger pot would have been helpful,
but it wasn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: A larger pot from the get-go, I wouldn't
necessarily say transplanting more
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently would be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've gotten it down,
not to brag on ourselves, we can
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant some shit where there's like
zero stress, where the plants are even
[SPEAKER_01]: happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get to stretch a little more at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you guys get comfortable,
I like to go myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from the cloner into a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've been introduced to a new
product that I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just called a clone cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where to order them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were kicked down to me as a gift for
a trial, a trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're harder than a normal cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little bigger than a normal cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're raised a little and they've got
holes to where they can drain a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the clone cup company, I really like
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are listening, I could use
like 90 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look pretty dope.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go, well, the solo cups, you got to
poke them yourself and they squeeze
[SPEAKER_01]: together when you try to scoop dirt into
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These cups are a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can wash them and reuse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to keep going to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go from the cloner into that cup and
then I let it get kind of, kind of close
[SPEAKER_01]: to root bound in that cup, but not,
I just want to see the thick roots on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I picked up the dirt, I want to see
roots, but I don't let the plant start to
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go to a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes if I'm doing like a
breeding, a fino hunt, I'll run them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll flower them out in the three gallon
when they're real short.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going bigger, I'll throw them into
a seven gallon and flower them out in a
[SPEAKER_01]: seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just added and grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm castings, the dragonfly earth
medicine root dust, the black one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottle's not over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just simple stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a little bit of fish hydroslate
and I've started to cut out the OGT.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not using OGT now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, my roots were huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super duper huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have used a bigger pot,
but I don't think it was necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did the right amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't root bound, but the roots
were spaghetti like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that since we've started using
them, having them in cups, is almost like,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it okay today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it okay today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're literally, you have to be
on your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you leave them, they're going
to... And that's, I mean, regular plants
[SPEAKER_00]: do, but with the worm casting,
it is fierce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go out of order a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I said I had a bunch of news,
but since we're talking about all this
[SPEAKER_01]: organic stuff, another thing that I've
noticed that has really contributed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement in my plants, I use it in my
veg room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it in my flowering room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything but the clones gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones get it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they go into the dirt,
I feed it this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean gave me something called a Bokashi
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bokashi bucket is basically a five
gallon bucket with a piece of plastic as a
[SPEAKER_01]: catch or a shelf in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that shelf has holes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then underneath that shelf is a
spigot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that you throw,
we'll talk about more in a minute with
[SPEAKER_01]: more detail, but you throw your shit in
there and it starts to get funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can turn the spigot and get
the shit out is why that little shelf is
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get juice out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Juice, nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a miniature compost pile juicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best way and set up like a
Gatorade thing in a football stadium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great way because I was going way,
way a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take the Bokashi bucket and when I
got mine, I put the little shelf in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's got a little shelf that you put
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have it pre-affixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different models of the bucket
that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little shelf in there with
holes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put down a thin layer of newspaper,
just one sheet of newspaper so that I made
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put a small layer of the
Bokashi down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with some powdered stuff called
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprinkled about a handful of that on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you do is you just put,
I put, I'm a vegetarian and every banana
[SPEAKER_01]: that I eat has a banana peel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every strawberry that I eat has that
little, the leafy part at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some strawberries that come in
the package that are inedible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I eat an onion, the way I clean
my onion is I chop each end off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: onion and then I can get that onion skin
right off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got an end of each,
or each end of it and the onion skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ends and the skin go into my little
bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I've got this bowl filled,
I throw all my banana peels, my egg
[SPEAKER_01]: shells, my onion ends, my carrots that got
funky, the celery that I forgot to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coffee grounds are you have to dry them,
set them out and let them dry first if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do my Yerba Mate that I've cooked or
that I've used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my coffee grounds, you've got to set
them on a paper towel and let them dry for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put too much moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could explain why, but it's too much to
go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything fruit or veggie, what else can
go in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put meat and dairy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put your meat and dairy products
and bread in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose not to put, I don't eat any meat
or dairy and I only put a little bit of
bread in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be weird if your steaks got,
or if your plants got pork chops and steak
[SPEAKER_02]: and you didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just doesn't even happen in this
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that comes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just put the vegetables and the
fruits and shit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the, like some grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's apple cores and potato
peels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you put, they say to put a two inch
layer of food waste in there and then
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinkle a handful of the Bokashi and then
another two inch layer and sprinkle a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of Bokashi and try not to open it
very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw all of my scraps into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the bowl has starts to sneak up
the kitchen, then I put that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi bucket.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you've been here when I opened the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend going full work and
keeping it in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't open it up to put the scraps in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pop the lid on that sucker,
it is ripe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell the magic working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fermenting banana peels,
apple cores, grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are eggshells in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's avocados in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything I eat for the past couple
of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The juice that comes out of the nozzles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you keep putting, you keep packing your
fruit and vegetables in there or your food
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put your bacon and eggs in there
if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your food waste can go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you pack it down with this little
packer and keep sprinkling in the Kashi
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after about, it took me about 10
days, about 10 days, you unscrew the
[SPEAKER_01]: spigot that's on there and I put a mason
jar underneath it and this juice comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: and it starts off clear and kind of pink
or orange-ish and it smells like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it is like the bar trash can that got
thrown up in and left in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it should be a game in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just have the jar sitting here
and people be like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should just be like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar is sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the jar and I don't want no part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be part of this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: The juice that comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw that into a thing of clean water
with a bubbler and it bubbles up real good
[SPEAKER_01]: and it makes the stinkiest funky shit and
I feed that to my plants and I can see
[SPEAKER_01]: them dance around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lid on our bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it stinks too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a quick hole and just slide the
tube through and just that's the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants love it, people, but good God,
it's ripe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a real delicate stomach,
well, gosh, it might not be for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's the plants are loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more details.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost to the top now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've got one more good dump of
my bowl of banana peels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat a lot of bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a banana addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're really good for me and
they give me a lot of energy and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and they're organic and I can eat
them in like a million ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been eating the shit out of bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got one more dump into there and
then once I dump that bowl into there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't even be able to put more kashi
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll seal it and let it seal for about 14
days and everything that's in there is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially pickling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fermenting and pickling in there
and I'll pull out juice out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it kashi juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably get five, six, maybe eight
to 10 depending on how, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: soggy the top layer is going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get eight to 10 jars hopefully of
that kashi juice out of there and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: will take two large kiddie pools of soil
and I will put half of that kashi bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bottom of one kiddie pool and half
of the kashi bucket on another kiddie pool
[SPEAKER_01]: and cover that up with store-bagged soil
and mix that shit in and then in like 14
[SPEAKER_01]: to 21 days we'll have some dank composted
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just watched Mike eyes like immediately
go pointed inwards like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't I say I'm the one that messes with
the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wait for that bath time,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two kiddie pools, one with grow
kashi, bro kashi, and then the other with,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be worm castings too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the plants love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be any worm castings in there
just yet, but in the future there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: castings added to that same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that soil will get, that'll just be
the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we'll only need a little bit of that
soil per the regular soil mixing bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll make some dank soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a lot of microbes in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike does not look excited about this at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that's not like ever coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the worm castings- You wear
clothes to ruin like that day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wear something you don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the worm castings, the grow kashi,
what else are we using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish hydrosalates and the dragonfly earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see the roots on my plants and
the veg growth happening in my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things that we still have
to supplement and stuff, but my roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super impressed and I'm making my own
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make, with a hand full of worm
castings with one jar of that kashi tea
[SPEAKER_01]: with 15 scoops of grow kashi, which sounds
like a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10 scoops of grow kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never enough grow kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just use the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can, but- And if you want to
use molasses, it's like just like five
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to use molasses,
you don't need it, but you could make,
[SPEAKER_01]: I made 25 gallons of nutrients with just
that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was totally amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green, happy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my veg plants, all my clones that got
put into new pots, they all got fed that
[SPEAKER_01]: and they look completely happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is pretty much been switched
over to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good way you guys to recycle
all of your garden stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way or all your garden
stuff, all your waste, all your food
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck happened to my papers?
[SPEAKER_01]: They all landed in the wrong order.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're backwards and it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You switched it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to fix it without anybody
noticing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just take your food scraps and throw it
in there and you can make your own
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can save the world one drink at a time,
one food at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people put paper towels and
Kleenex and stuff in there too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll biodegrade in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you look to me like that's
disgusting, but I mean, it's rotten banana
[SPEAKER_01]: peels and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already pretty damn gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gross, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not looking forward to smelling the
industrial size one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the, I was looking for the
Grokashi website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another guy that does it in 55
gallon drums and he runs farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting there picturing a row of 55
gallon drums in the big salad bowl size
[SPEAKER_02]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's dumping it into five gallon buckets
and missing a portion of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over his feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't smell it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that town to the east of here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the town I'm talking about
where it's just cows like crammed into
[SPEAKER_00]: fences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them there or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could taste cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how Greeley smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Greeley is kind of kind of cow poopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I received an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, uh, where the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to find this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the ladybugs I've been hearing
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ladybug email I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a little bit about emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm searching for this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said I learned a little bit about emails,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the words that just came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm multitasking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't laugh at me or do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, yesterday, bro, I got hit in the
head so hard that I don't remember half of
[SPEAKER_01]: my evening and I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we were at a friend's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you deserve it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I did it to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's even funnier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two stairs that dip down into
this other part of these people's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right above the stairs, there's a,
like a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a beam, a head thing, like a
fucking, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a face smasher, a head smasher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a decorative awning thing
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I don't, I don't remember hitting
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I remember is getting up off the
ground and Sean looking at me going,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I continued on has never had that
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to pick up a chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went and got the chair and took it to
where I was getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I set it down, I felt drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I am fucked up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Smith's is like, you want to dab a
little big one, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt weird all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had someone come hang out with me last
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, you're like loopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I told you, I got hit in
the head hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, dude, it was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smacked on my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, face smash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't even, I didn't feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't hurt until like when I sat down
later, cause I got hit so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: My just went out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My body was like, sleepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was on the floor at Spencer's
house, just laying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, we've all had one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens a lot in this town.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was pretty worried about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look on their faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it was loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they all stood up and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell was I going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got way distracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly I feel like I got a head injury
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this dude, he asked me not to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's parts of this email that I won't
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some of it was just for me,
but he opens with, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks for the awesome pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your style and mystic roots were a
perfect fit for bed music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to read this on the pod,
but please don't mention my real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use vape dad on Reddit, very active
in R slash trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he talks about his soil,
where he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says, I was reading a book
called cannabis cultivation the other day
[SPEAKER_01]: at Barnes and Noble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recommended putting ladybugs in
our greenhouse to fight aphids and
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars and a whole assortment of
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm researching organic growing for no
other reason than I like the all natural
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking, thinking like this, I was
wondering, would it be a good idea to
[SPEAKER_01]: raise loose ladybugs in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could they hurt in the stages of
growth, if anything, or could these be
[SPEAKER_01]: nature's pest control for those aspiring
to care give?
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be a dumb question, but I just
wanted to ask a live person with some real
[SPEAKER_01]: quantifiable growing experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, thanks for the pod and keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really beautiful thing you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I hope you get invited to the
Joe Rogan experience pod one day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know your plants would miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all the free grow info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love, vape dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I say his real name, that email at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure that I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty high, but I don't think you
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you're welcome for all the free grow
info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am proud and happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to quit growing all the mids,
start fucking eliminating all the no-melt
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebraska and get everybody growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody needs to be growing high quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I have to do is talk into a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Rogan experience podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if I got there, I don't know what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be super stoked to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sit there and grin into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to be on that show with Ari and
Joey Diaz and Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hate that would come from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you haters, but I'd love to be on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, you said this may be a dumb
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No dumb questions, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_01]: No dumb questions at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had training wheels at one point and now
I'm doing wheelies and you just got to
[SPEAKER_01]: start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no dumb questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory on ladybugs, and Michael
probably backed me up on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, I did what I thought was
cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to the hydro store and I bought
a thousand ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about your experiment
while you were reading the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opened up the container and let them fly
about the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out the camera and took pictures of
ladybugs fucking on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really cool.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: See Adams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell 300 in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lights went out and then the next
day I rolled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He released, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: 1500?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like the envelope, the t-shirt
from Amazon shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just opened that fucker and dumped all
the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next morning, if I released 1500 of
them the next morning, there were 50 alive
[SPEAKER_01]: in that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fly into all your fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fly up into your lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's something that Sean taught me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Credit to Sean Kinkola.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught me this and I'm going to butcher
it because I had a head injury that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs don't see in the same spectrum as
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs see a UV spectrum that's only
provided by the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we take a ladybug and we put it in
a grow room, all it sees is a grow light
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's confused now and it wants to get
toward the light that it can see and the
[SPEAKER_01]: warmth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it flies into your hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flies into your fans and you get to
sweep them all up and they smell terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent months cleaning ladybugs out of
every little corner and looking cranny in
[SPEAKER_02]: that fucking grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd find them in weird places
randomly too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't do much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are predatory mites that are worth
it, that work indoors, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that ladybugs, praying mantis are cool
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ladybugs are also migratory creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to eat and then they want to fly
away and then they want to eat and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to fly away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my honest opinion, I would say no on
the ladybug in an indoor situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a greenhouse or an outdoor
situation and you're ready to keep,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to keep adding to
them and you're also going to have to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do require food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if there are aphids and shit there,
like you don't want to eat hummus and
[SPEAKER_01]: falafel all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to provide them some kind of
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind if you're going to
use them in an outdoor or a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, but indoors, I would not do the
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that food could also bring other
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, I tell people to release
them around their grow, not in their grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sprinkle them in the front and
backyard and don't bother with them
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise just as like an extra
preventative measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about the mantis is I've
been in a few pet stores here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and like you guys carry mantis and I'm
expecting to like see a whole fish tank
[SPEAKER_00]: full of mantises and like, yeah,
I'll take 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to order them and they'll send you
eggs and then you got to let the eggs
[SPEAKER_01]: hatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Arbico.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: A-R-B-I-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got all kinds of great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll send you bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll send you nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might not be able to get
everything, but organic pest control at
[SPEAKER_01]: its finest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like sharing useful shit with
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going 32 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go about 45, maybe an hour at
the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to read some news
articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys want to get into the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, but we can make a two episode thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next dab though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You thinking so?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way Mike thinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dab some lemonade from
Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, was it John John that recommended
this to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, somebody talk for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was down there, he didn't,
he had not had a sample of the review yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he couldn't really give me an honest
opinion, but the name was enticing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but names can be misleading sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know about the name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting hearing about where
the, the handkerchief came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that was, I'm a gamer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Mike's a gamer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pretty fucking funny story
because I didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really a big Uncharted fan,
but that was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like John John, you're the man,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to the Turpey mansion,
the Turpey boy trap house, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of on a semi-frequent basis and do a
podcast up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, John John, you need to be there
again at the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you your own mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one mic that was being passed around
because there were a lot of people there,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, and you'd hear people would
come in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One guy would come in and hear,
Hey, my name is Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say Dabs on Dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would leave and like Larry would
come in and he'd be like, and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know half the people, they just wanted to
get in on shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I was just, I've loved that
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you do a lot of cool shit,
but most of the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I give a fuck about wanting to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listened to that episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, damn, why wasn't I there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't taken anybody to that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hiding in the trunk next time you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my little secret spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you got sneak away friends,
you guys are dabbing and everyone in the
[SPEAKER_02]: house freaks out because there's a weird
white guy in the front yard just staring
[SPEAKER_02]: at the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come next time and you can be the
producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll teach you how to hook up all the gear
and you can be the producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's much, that's a, I would,
I would stick producer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producer sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like official, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a suit and a tie and no one
would give you any shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's he?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wear a tie at city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not wearing one of the fucking trap
outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take my first dab of this
lemonade from Turbex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Turbex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I should taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause what if it's terrible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan, you're on the, you're on the money
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, uh, I watched a couple of their,
the, the guys that were on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: the old world videos that they did on
YouTube and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be on it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess they got busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could obviously tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picked up, businesses picked up from back
in the day and they all got, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing these fucking dishes
everywhere, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet those boys are busy as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these black Turbex containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pull out one of these people know
what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, tasty, definitely tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon candy with, uh, it's another flavor
that I can't yet describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll hit me in a minute, but it's
definitely a sativa high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause my head is going and it made my
eyes wobbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is something that only a couple of
other strains have ever done to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that one of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just the email cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens when the email cord
touches the microphone or the headphone
[SPEAKER_01]: jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys heard it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sounded like robots for a minute there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fix it in post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put half of it to my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has the, the high lemon
terpene there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name is worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name is worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely some lemonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to go back for a little mini
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a wine connoisseur.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it is angled.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be hung up on that cord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't smoke tobacco people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the PSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that was pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just worked the email cord,
the mic cable, the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all just took the same size dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a bigger dab than that and didn't
choke tobacco, tobacco's fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say no to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends say no to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do some news.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 37 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just do a couple of these news
articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll save a couple for maybe Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually want to give a big shout out to
one of my Facebook friends, Mike Howley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call him bike Howley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Michael Howley, but he's from
Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a mass hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cool ass dude to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows what's up with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can separate the bullshit from the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should be more known in our cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to give him a shout out right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably doesn't listen to this show in
any way, but huge shout out to Mike bike
[SPEAKER_01]: Howley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all your Facebook posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see how much you try to help and
participate with our community and I
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I found out about this story,
but it says pot pesticide contamination in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article is by William breathes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, I'm going to choke here in a
second because I took a huge dab,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six marijuana grows in Denver were ordered
to quarantine and possibly destroy plant
[SPEAKER_01]: harvests after Denver fire department
officials determined that the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities weren't using chemicals
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried so hard not to laugh and the
harder I tried not to, the worse it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike just moved away from the microphone
to sneeze, but head butted the mic stand
[SPEAKER_01]: with his sneeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking glorious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little head butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was video for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not using chemicals properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs and pests are a fact of life for
commercial growers, but dealing with them
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriately is important because
eventually humans will consume the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier this month, the city of Denver
released a bulletin warning grows or
[SPEAKER_01]: warning grows about the improper use of
pesticides because the fire department's
[SPEAKER_01]: recent discovery, the city has ordered all
licensed pot grows in the city to send in
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide reports by April 1st pesticides
and agricultural chemicals must be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: accordance with the product label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all applicable federal state and
local laws and regulations, improper use
[SPEAKER_01]: of pesticides on marijuana can raise
serious public health concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bulletin reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: The catch is that the federal agency in
charge of regulating pesticide use,
[SPEAKER_01]: the environmental protection agency
doesn't have acceptable levels for use on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis since cannabis is illegal on a
federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colorado department of agriculture
lacks official guidelines too beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: suggesting that growers not use any
pesticides that haven't been specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: tested, labeled and assigned a set
tolerance for pot growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, anybody that's listened to this
podcast for more than three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes already knows what my solution to
part of this problem is environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: protection agency does not have acceptable
levels for use on cannabis since cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is illegal on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solution anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's your first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will make this a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: With legalization comes product safety
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: The CDA does have an unofficial list of
pesticides that can be used on unspecified
[SPEAKER_01]: crops that are intended for human
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, consumption, however,
I kind of read that weird, my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state marijuana enforcement
division has a strict list of allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides as well as instructions for how
grow owners have to store and dispose of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: State law also requires that shops write
up standard operating procedures for all
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Denver, dispensaries will now be
required to submit a list of every
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide used and how much of it is used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copies of those records must be kept in
the facility where the marijuana is grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, grows must send lists of
pesticides and information on their safety
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Denver fire department and a sign
must be placed on the door of every grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room listing any and all pesticides used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those businesses that don't comply could
face fines and closures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, I work with a
dispensary and I'm there on a semi-daily
[SPEAKER_01]: basis the past couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, they are not joking when they say
they're going to fine you or close you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will come in that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will find a violation that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will write a $10,000 fine and they
will close your shop down right on the
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that's here, leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at the spot that I represent,
but I've seen it happen to another place.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't get the amount of regulation
and oversight that this industry operates
[SPEAKER_02]: under.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the MED is massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm hanging out near the bud room,
I'll hear people, it's been a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: since anyone said it, but you'll hear
people or people that don't have an ID
[SPEAKER_01]: that want to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just let me in just once?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, this is a billion dollar
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly, but I mean,
it's fucking more money than you could
[SPEAKER_01]: even imagine and we're going to risk all
of our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one dude to sneak through without his
ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every operation in town, you can call a
million dollar business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I saw the price list for just some of
the grow equipment that I ordered the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, we need like 30 of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, that's this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, order it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh my God, that's a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we just spent a house on fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get more into this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the city also says that the Denver
department of public health and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment will be inspecting cultivation
sites as well as infused product
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was happening to you guys,
you heard the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some shops in Denver,
some grows in Denver that were using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals that should not have been being
used on the cannabis that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: selling to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my bet that the shops that were
busting out those $75 and $99 ounces,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably they're just selling the coupons
on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that you see in the back of the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, man, that's terrible that
they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture of this article makes it the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there is a picture of a guy in like a
breaking bad suit with the full on gas
[SPEAKER_01]: mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pouring a bottle of Monsanto
chemicals into another container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely unrelated to anything
to do with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fear and height picture is all
it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn the computer this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you gotta lean this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got too many things plugged in,
but look at this shit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full on breaking bad suit, chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to do with cannabis or this
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like he's pouring glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Eagle 20 looks like that if you've
ever seen Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of assumed we talked about it,
friends and I, Eagle 20 was probably one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the products being used in all of this
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I read it right, the shops that have
their crops quarantined right now turn
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves in essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they handed in their form that was
due April 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they started looking at it,
they were like, Hey, wait, that's on the
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever list here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, see, I haven't read that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the only article I've seen about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another big change with hash the
other day where they're like rescheduling
[SPEAKER_00]: it or something like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you got the news article?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, uh, we'll look for that one on
another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even a news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of being a smart ass to you.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear about this one thing that I'm
not prepared to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our correspondent Adam Gaskin
shows up unprepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy some high shit and unprepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually on Instagram.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck my bad, but I'm not even going to be
able to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this article is super long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much time I've got, I might skip this
one and we might give you guys a Wednesday
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got us roll over here to garage man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far are we going?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 45 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do this super long
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to save that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to be like,
what is it more lube more lube?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to, he's referring to the
Floria episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is not a weird bromance
going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I scroll down to the cannabis and this
article is by David McFadden of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of bunny whaler lighting
up a big old bowl in front of a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: King Haile Selassie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to the right of him is King Haile
Selassie and the queen sitting right next
[SPEAKER_01]: to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get into, I'll get to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historic new gondolas in Jamaica for
Rastafari religious use comma MMJ program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kingston, Jamaica, marijuana has been
pervasive, but illegal in Jamaica for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades, consumed as a medicinal herb,
puffed as a sacrament by Rastafarians and
[SPEAKER_01]: sung about in the islands famed reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: After many years of dialogue about the
culturally entrenched drug and embod,
[SPEAKER_01]: emboldened what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And emboldened by changes to drug laws in
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: States, Jamaica's parliament on Tuesday,
Tuesday night gave final approval to enact
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalizing small amounts of pot and
establishing a licensing agency to
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate a lawful medical marijuana
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got medical marijuana in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: The historic amendments paved the way for
a cannabis licensing authority to be
[SPEAKER_01]: established to deal with regulating and
cultivating and distributing and
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution of marijuana for medical and
scientific purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both houses of Jamaica's legislature have
approved this legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's so funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fuck it all high.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an awesome story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Mountain Dew was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some power to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He held that far from the mics and it was
still like a shotgun in my ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people from the South to be like,
that's a good kind of Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a beer opens like that, it's like,
that's a good kind of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a good kind of beer right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of them special Mountain Dews.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've drank a Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been over a year since I've had
Mountain Dew, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably since I was 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like getting off crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: My body went through a withdrawal for a
minute there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the regular Dew and the faux Dew
at home just in case I run out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he does make his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the little fizz machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in a victory for religious freedom,
adherence to the homegrown Rastafari
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual movement can now freely use
marijuana for sacramental purposes for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time on the tropical land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I, Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law makes possession of up to two
ounces of marijuana a petty offense that
[SPEAKER_01]: could result in a ticket, but not a
criminal record.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivation of five... That don't sound
legal white, Mike.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've got medical marijuana now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, before, if you got caught with
cannabis in Jamaica, it was seven days in
[SPEAKER_01]: a Jamaican jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seven days in a Jamaican jail,
I'd probably rather do 45 days in a Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: jail, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not going to be anything fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sleep on the cement floor with the
rats and you don't get no food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, two ounces, petty offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any
premises would be permitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow five ganja plants now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tourists who are prescribed medical
marijuana abroad will soon be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for permits authorizing them to
legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed
[SPEAKER_01]: or ganja, as it is known locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking brilliant marketing on
behalf of the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say 15 bucks so that you can fill your
prescription while you're... I don't... Oh
[SPEAKER_02]: God, why did I say like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to bring it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy it while I'm there, not bring it
back on your boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's going to be reggae cruise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggae cruise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody saw my Instagram
and Facebook post about reggae cruise,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in November, I think, there's the
biggest cruise with like 20 of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to Jamaica and it's
going to be even more fun now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, on Wednesday, Colorado-based United
Cannabis Corp said it has launched a
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership with Jamaican agencies to
launch a marijuana research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development facility on the island that
they hope will lead patents and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Bunting, the island's national
security minister said the legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its
stance on transnational drug trafficking
[SPEAKER_01]: or cultivation of illegal plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica has long been considered the
Caribbean's largest supplier of pot to the
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and regional islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The passage of this legislation does not
create a free for all in the growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: transporting, dealing or exporting of
ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security forces will continue to
rigorously enforce Jamaican law with our
[SPEAKER_01]: international treaty obligations,
Bunting said in parliament.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, I'm glad that's not my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm William Brownfield, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: assistant secretary for counter narcotics
affairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this dude told the Associated Press
days before the vote that Jamaican law is
[SPEAKER_01]: of course Jamaica's own business and
Jamaica's sovereign decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he noted that the trafficking of
marijuana into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: remains against the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We expect that Jamaica and all states
party to the UN drug conventions will
[SPEAKER_01]: uphold their obligations, including a firm
commitment to combating and dismantling
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal organizations involved in drug
trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told AP in an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, you guys, how do we stop
illegal cannabis trafficking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only answer that makes any sense
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is buy a small plane at
first, and then we fly people straight
[SPEAKER_00]: from Colorado to Jamaica for a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to stop somewhere in
the middle of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller the plane, the more frequently
it stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you now, if it's going to be
anywhere, it's Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to keep reading before Adam
crashes the plane in a fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying anybody's got the money from
Colorado to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is there weed legal in both?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, debate has long raged in
Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting
[SPEAKER_01]: ganja, but previous calls to decriminalize
small amounts of marijuana fizzled out
[SPEAKER_01]: because officials feared it would bring
sanctions from Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican officials now have high hopes
that the island can become a player in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Naskin medical marijuana industry,
health tourism, and the development of
[SPEAKER_01]: innovative pot derived items.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local scientists already have a history of
creating marijuana derived products such
[SPEAKER_01]: as Canisal, which helps relieve pressure
in the eyes of glaucoma patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how they say local scientists in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know some dude with dreadlocks sitting
on a five gallon bucket making bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've seen quite a few people that
are moving down that way as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of popular people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our friends went on a trip there
just recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a couple months back,
but as soon as this happened, when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like coming up, they went there and helped
them put this shit in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching lots of YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the people from Steep Hill,
like Addie Wynn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Addison DeMorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see you at the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think quite a few are from up there in
Denver River Rock area and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where were I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton said the
cannabis industry holds great potential
[SPEAKER_01]: for Jamaica where marijuana has long been
grown illegally on mountainsides and
[SPEAKER_01]: marshes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an
international trend of easing restrictions
[SPEAKER_01]: on marijuana for medical or personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 20 U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: states allow some form of medical
marijuana and last year, Colorado and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington legalized personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Tuesday, Alaska became the third U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: state to legalize the recreational use of
marijuana for adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Americas, Uruguay last year became
the first nation to create a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Argentina, personal possession of
marijuana was decriminalized under a 2009
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court ruling that jail time for
small amounts of drugs violates the
[SPEAKER_01]: country's constitution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while in Chile permits use of medical
marijuana, details of Jamaica's licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: authority and its hope for medical
marijuana sector will need to be refined
[SPEAKER_01]: in upcoming months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, Jamaican cannabis crusaders
applauded the amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big step in the right direction,
but there's still a lot of work to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: said Delano Sivarite, Director of the
Cannabis Commercial and Medical Task
[SPEAKER_01]: Force.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big up to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking steps in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much more traveling and tourism is
going to happen there because people can
[SPEAKER_01]: go there and get your medical marijuana
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they charge everybody like even five
bucks to 15 bucks or whatever to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to legally consume without not have to
worry about it while they're there,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be millions for the
government just off taxes alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is like the only warm place
that it's semi-legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all those in the summer,
we get 300 days of sunshine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get pretty damn warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, being closer to the equator,
I'm sure it's hot, but that beach sure
[SPEAKER_00]: does help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jamaica would be dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when it goes into effect,
but I want to go visit now and go take
[SPEAKER_01]: some dabs in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they're down there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: The workforce got dreads at a blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of more things that I
want to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was enough news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we did the ladybug thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, somebody sent me an email about
fermentation and your fermentation
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to address that, but I'm wanting
to do it when Sean's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean is the guy to talk to about
fermentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big shout out to vigor
lover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lynn's happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: James Holt, dude, you sent me a compliment
on Facebook and I told you, thanks for
[SPEAKER_01]: listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't seem to take me seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seemed like I was kind of dicking you
around, but no, I was fucking not
[SPEAKER_01]: condescending at all when I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you listened to this and I hope you
took me seriously because you're one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most bad-ass professional guitar
players.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even saying you're a professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're demeanor the way you do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a professional and for you to
compliment me like that just meant a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't even being a prick about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucking totally serious,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That blew my mind that you listened and
that you complimented me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a big shout out to Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's moving back to North Carolina or Ohio
to get a real job and handle business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool having you around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like talking about glass with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of Mikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado bearded dabbers, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's moving back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to take care of some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to miss you, bro,
but I'm sure I'll see you again,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to hang up the beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dab dab world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, he trimmed up the beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for listening to the one
year episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you guys, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called these guys like a half hour ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you want to come over and do a
podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, shit, yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was dropping dimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pulling off your wedding ring while
you're on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: We going out after this or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, there will be a growers meeting
April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for the cup cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis cup is coming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for that guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be hanging out at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to see everybody there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any shout outs to give or
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm looking at my paper.

while he's at work while he's at work in
[SPEAKER_01]: his cubicle.

[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking notes from pot plants and

[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, yeah.

[SPEAKER_01]: Once that's out, we'll play it on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably be late spring,
early summer before the song's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll play it on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Deez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you listen to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will post a link to this on Bong TV.
