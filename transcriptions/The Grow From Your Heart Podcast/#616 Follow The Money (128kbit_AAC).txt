haywire with birthday love birthday

[SPEAKER_00]: It felt amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

very warm greetings, very well put deep
[SPEAKER_00]: thought out messages from people wishing
me a happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people sent some really great
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just said happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people sent a nice elaborate message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got a lot of great gifts from
friends, fans, listeners, from the family,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate every single one of those
gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are very thoughtful gifts,
gifts like gloves and hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go talking about gifts
that I was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm a shoe head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clothing to keep me warm was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drumsticks were amazing and shoes are one
of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a shoe cleaning kit from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody who gave me some
amazing, beautiful birthday gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, that birthday love didn't
mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday if it's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your birthday is coming up this
year, happy birthday to you because the
[SPEAKER_00]: birthday love does feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've got an iry genetics discord
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put the link right here in the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it on the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link is also in the video description,
so look for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iry genetics, iry army, grow from your
heart podcast, all things Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: discord channel is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discord is blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The server has been getting a lot of
boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, after my birthday celebration
on the Monday night live feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hung out in the discord neighborhood
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will include a link to that in the show
notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a discord chat where I hang out
on video, take dabs with the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody is welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody is invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can figure out how to make discord
work, how to make that chat work and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to get in there, that's the only test
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in, agree to the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules are that the neighborhood is
always right and you won't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on in and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can agree to those rules,
like I said before, if you can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: discord work and if you can get through
all the hoops that discord makes you do to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to our live chat, you're more than
welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more than invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make no promises as to how frequent
frequently, how often, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule I'm going to adhere to being in
that live chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've got some time to kill,
maybe when I'm packing up seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just put on some headphones,
turn on a microphone and hang out with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and take some dabs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: During these quarantine times,
during these lockdown times, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening in the future right now,
we are still in sort of a quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not allowed to play with our friends
as much as we'd like during these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice to have something like a
zoom chat, like the discord chat,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that to be interactive with
more fellow smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers, stoners, like-minded friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a beautiful way for me to
keep in touch with the ivory army,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the crew, the people that are growing
my strains, the people that support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like hanging out with you guys
and just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs kicking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get to ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because sometimes people come
in there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say the word starstruck,
but they've been following me for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been watching the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in and they're like,
holy shit, there he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just welcome you say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I act like it's just no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually everyone's just hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody talking about whatever's on
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about whatever's on your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once everybody comes in and just settles
down, the starstruck feeling goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all just hang out, chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spot for me to be interactive,
a spot for you to be interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some social feed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some social interaction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is the discord is blowing up
and the discord hang and the neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: has become a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite you guys to come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more than welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more than invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see your smiling faces on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to cam up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put up a little icon, a little
logo on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to, we'll just see a picture
of whatever you would like when you're on
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera, but we'd love you to join the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out, share the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link in the video
description, the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I will try to type it right up
here somewhere on the screen so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that have an idea of where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new to discord, be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you figured out it is a really good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enough rambling on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join us on the IRI
genetics discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to all the fine
ladies and gentlemen who not only
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in there, but also run that
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great people who do a
lot of great things to make sure it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize people were putting so
much time and energy and effort and also
[SPEAKER_00]: money into the IRI genetics discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically built for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I'm IRI genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also, but it's the community that's
doing it, running it, functioning it,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it happen, uh, making it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to the fucking IRI army,
the grow from your heart crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rasta Jeff team, team IRI genetics,
whatever you guys want to call yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you deserve some credit, feel it in
your heart right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel this fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you a feel the kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give the mic that was for you
for being a good little soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute to everyone in the discord,
the IRI army for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then I want to say thanks to all of
it's weird calling you fans, supporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners, viewers, the army, the crew,
the gang that is learning from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all of the love,
the support, and most of all the trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you've got to have huge trust in
me to take my advice to run your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are relying on your garden
for several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's how you're paying the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's your therapy while you're
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's your therapy when you're
trimming, then it's your financial
[SPEAKER_00]: survival when you flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's also your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, you use that flip to
cover the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are trusting me with a lot and I
understand how much, uh, trust you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in me basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that you trust me that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking awesome that you guys
support me and you trust me that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with your garden, I'm basically
writing you instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time you guys go and
execute my instructions and you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the support,
not only on the podcast, not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I try to do, but my seed
company is thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: My social media is thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, life is good for Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics, uh, the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you guys, it would not be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, gals, everybody out there
listening without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just be some weirdo with the
microphone and hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed that,
uh, you guys have built a huge community
[SPEAKER_00]: around the vibe, the company, the idea
that I created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me to see it thriving,
to see it flourish, especially in these
[SPEAKER_00]: weird times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not only are we in like a pandemic
situation, we're also, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: financially strapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't have a lot of extra money
because of this, uh, finance, this
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you choose to financially support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are hundreds, if not thousands
of shows to watch support, listen to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: your time, money, energy on viewing,
clicking, like, supporting, encouraging,
[SPEAKER_00]: loving, and you choose to do that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot for me, to me,
with me, however you want to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You financially support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make a living from the podcast and
through my seed company and through my
[SPEAKER_00]: consultations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do help me make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click like on all of my videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be watching other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 10 friends that make their own
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably watching my show right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody that chooses to
watch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support me, support my company,
support my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of podcasts out there with
Patreons and you choose to support mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gushing, uh, just feeling the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a birthday, feeling the love,
wanted to return the love back to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure you guys know that I'm not
just sucking up rewards and not feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: the appreciation for the love,
respect and support that I'm getting from
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it a minute ago without you,
I wouldn't be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how much you feel like you did
or did not your large or small
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This community is huge and it's happening
without me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is on discord in the discord chat
right now while I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are in discord answering grow from
your heart questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, purple thumb is probably posting a
link, how to sell irie genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Dave's not here is running an auction
right now for me on discord while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a lot of stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is probably answering a grow
question on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my web guy is updating web stuff just
randomly for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit is happening when I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm asleep, the discord is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The irie army is still out there
conquering, getting shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I'm enjoying my weekend,
that discord keeps running when I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: even there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the irie army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I said it jokingly the other night,
the irie army, we take more dabs before
[SPEAKER_00]: nine AM than most people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day and we still kick ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're kind to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got awesome gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got good families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good people and we still have time
to hang out in that discord chat at like
[SPEAKER_00]: four in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge community and I'm
overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't tell, I've been gushing for
several minutes about this, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the morbid thought that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse that throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take some gnarly dabs a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the morbid thought that I had was I
could pass away now this moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as this episode makes it out and
you guys get my gratitude, I could pass
[SPEAKER_00]: away right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this company, this podcast,
this idea that I created will still thrive
[SPEAKER_00]: for at least a decade to come until
YouTube deletes my episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stay up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've got a friend sub cool who passed
away like a year ago, rest in peace and
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still watch his videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm still keeping subby
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will continue to watch my videos
for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm still growing sub cool seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me that when I'm gone,
hopefully somebody out there is still
[SPEAKER_00]: growing my seeds for generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe somebody will breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I did for sub subs gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it to keep subby alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The man may be gone, but his work,
his legend, his idea, his vibe will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue as partly my, uh, it's partly my
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt to continue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody in the ivory army,
I have a good feeling of who a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: those people may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kicking ass with my genetics, doing work
for me that I don't even know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a few people I have in mind
that I know if I were to pass right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those people would continue by
rework.
[SPEAKER_00]: My strains would be crossed to other
things and crossed with themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people would continue the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website would be continued to survive
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from a bank account until that
bank account is drained.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website would exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I passed away at this moment,
after I put out this podcast, we'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: just after I hit post, you guys get to
hear this, uh, this company, I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, this podcast, the grow from your
heart podcast will survive indefinitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, possibly infinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as YouTube goes on this exists,
which is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you guys are growing and
breeding and taking care of the clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, the vibe, the idea that I created
now at this point will last almost
[SPEAKER_00]: indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't plan on going anywhere,
but I'm just saying keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spread this forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this all it's called the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slogan behind irie genetics used to be
grow from your heart and breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we kind of separated the two entities
to have two different LLCs here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but grow from your heart, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always what it's been about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I'm rambling, but,
uh, just keep growing from your heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys, and it'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spreading that love, spreading that
vibe is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I do have some topics for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going to be me rambling for
the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually it is, but we've got some
topics for me to ramble about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my email inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, my email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any grow questions,
cannabis concerns, cannabis culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to answer that stuff here on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one says, have you done a show
about which companies are owned by
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawthorne or plan on doing that episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some people are going, that's
random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we care about what's owned by
Hawthorne?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do a specific episode on
companies, which are owned by Hawthorne,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this will set me up for a good rant,
which goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not going to bash or roast any
certain brands or companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we know who we shouldn't support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know most of us know who we should not
be supporting, who the big devils are in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and commercial in the world,
uh, in capitalism and just politics and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of know who we should be voiding,
who we should be avoiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm kind of an older guy by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 42 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good idea of where my money
should go and who's getting my money and
[SPEAKER_00]: who makes what and who runs what at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some of you guys haven't put too
much thought about where the money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, here's the thing to think about
this guy is saying, uh, have I done a show
[SPEAKER_00]: about Hawthorne Hawthorne is kind of a big
company that owns a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not have the best values.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not have the best views on
keeping the world safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be the best at keeping humans
safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be focused more on the dollars
than the long-term effects of human
[SPEAKER_00]: safety, environmental safety, and
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do a little talk about,
um, avoiding those types of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically Scotty real puts it best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty real says, vote with your dollars,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about voting with
our dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the word I wrote was conscious
spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I wrote on my flow chart
here was follow the money, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're shopping for, uh,
I'm going to focus this on growth support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies nutrients, soil, soil is mix,
uh, we'll go as far as saying lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, anything in your grow,
but this could apply to anything in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life, wherever you're spending money,
time, energy, is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it somewhere you want to spend your
hard earned money, time, energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: money is expensive, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work hard for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do something you don't want
to do for a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably unless you're blessed and have it
really lucky, you're probably working for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody you don't like who doesn't
appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't see how hard you work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't understand how hard your
struggle is and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So money's expensive, putting in your time
and energy to get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow the money when you're spending
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to spend that money?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that when you buy a product,
you may have two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the company that you buy a product
from, does company a use that money to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, re forest the rain forest or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does the other company use that money
to shoot babies, uh, on Sundays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you spending your money with?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know we're going to save the
rainforest, not shoot babies on Sunday,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an easy way to decide how to
spend your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little research on where the money
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you spend it, what are you going to
do with it, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to support a presidential
candidate that we're not up for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to support a presidential
candidate that is on cannabis's side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because why are you going to spend your
money with a company who is against the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you're buying their product to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to be political,
but also kind of, it's not just political.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, uh, this is a personal decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some things, a conscious decision
we need to start making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe some people aren't aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your contribution go to a good cause
or does your contribution go to more
[SPEAKER_00]: research to create more products that are
not going to be desirable for our planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: our world?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to bash too many specific
companies, say too many names.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that Monsanto was the devil,
that Scott's is the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that falls in that umbrella,
we may not want to give them our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the option, uh, to give your
money to a mom and pop shop at bro and
[SPEAKER_00]: chick owned a shop in your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some, uh, lady that's been in the
grow community, opened up a new hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: store, go shop there, avoid that big box
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that some people,
some places, some locations, the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you've got is that big chain store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go to home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to hit the Walmart,
but if there's a small shop that is
[SPEAKER_00]: available, it may be a dollar or two more
to shop there, but it's worth your time,
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And energy to support that family.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy something from Bill's garden
supply store, Bill gets to buy himself a
[SPEAKER_00]: truck and drive around in that truck so
that he could take his kids to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill gets to buy his kids school clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just going to Walmart so that
Walmart, so that Sam Walton, I know he's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone, but the Walmart family can buy more
jets and Ferraris and Corvettes and fly
[SPEAKER_00]: around and treat their employees like
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go over to Bill's, Bill is probably
the guy working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill's going to treat you with
kindness, treat you with respect and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate your business and appreciate
you shopping there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I do when you choose to support
my brand, my company, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast or the I read
genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Bill is going to appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, uh, if you don't shop at that
small mom and pop shop, every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: need something, when you do need something
that only they carry, that place might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Walmart, if you go to home
Depot, if you go to Lowe's and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of questions, Hey Bill,
what's the best way to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you get somebody at home Depot or
Lowe's that's slightly competent,
[SPEAKER_00]: competent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the word I tried to say,
but if you go talk to Bill at Bill's
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware, Bill will have six or seven
different ideas on how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll find out which is the best idea for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll walk you up and down the aisles,
build you a little shopping cart of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that's going to work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake your hand and wish you the best and
send you on your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come back in two or three days
with pictures of the job on your phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill's going to high five you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be part of the community,
not just walking into a big box,
[SPEAKER_00]: being another zombie with a credit card,
living with a bunch of plastic shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: going home and hoping you've got what
you've got and giving our money to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Waltons and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a weird long rant for
a podcast about cannabis, but let's follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the money when we're shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow the money, conscious
spending, conscious shopping, conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming, uh, vote with your dollars,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're going to buy a product,
if you can buy a locally sourced product,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can, I understand that not
everything is made everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, buy something local.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not made local, buy it from a
store that is local.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, then think about where is the
money going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I buy this, hopefully it goes to a
local grow store so that Bill's grow store
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to pay their bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to pay the light bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to pay the rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Bill gets to pay his mortgage and buy
some groceries, take care of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a feel good feeling,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hopefully that money's going to a
company that is making a quality product
[SPEAKER_00]: and not using a bunch of crappy,
uh, imported or half ass ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're trying to keep our money
close to home with people that we care
[SPEAKER_00]: about instead of just watching it go
blindly to causes which we do not support
[SPEAKER_00]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've spent enough time on that
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see, do you want your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see your name on here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to give you a shout out
by name, but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message and thank
you for sparking a great line of ranting
[SPEAKER_00]: on this episode of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message came from the grow help
tab on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the website, I read genetics
.com on the top bar, there is a grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to ask a grow question
and ask for grow advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do ask a few preliminary questions
before we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask your name, what strain you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing indoors or outdoors,
you will see the questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do go to the website and jump on
that grow help tab, just click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get you right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can ask your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question comes from our friend newbie
nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing granddaddy perp to
platinum cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're growing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see, let's get right to the
question here because it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: my question is uncutting clones for
sexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked about this in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out if you've got male
or female plants and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait till they get real big, you can cut a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put that clone in your rapid
router under your dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it under 12, 12 lighting and quite
quickly it will tell you if it's a male or
[SPEAKER_00]: a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll know if the plant,
which that clone came from was a boy or a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you need to continue
working with that plant or if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that catches you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says now I am practicing saving for a
dragon punch and lemon sunrise for this
[SPEAKER_00]: March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, those will grow well in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've never ran regular seeds as I
have a five plant limit over five inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm practicing and I took one of my
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the granddaddy purple candy land plant
and put it in soil with Michael Reisey and
[SPEAKER_00]: dipped it in cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a five plant limit,
which that's very restrictive and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow some regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we got to find out which are the males
and females so we don't grow the males up
[SPEAKER_00]: too big and waste time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are doing a test run to find out
how to sex your plants by doing quick
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you took cuts, you took a cut of the
GDP candy land plant, put it in soil with
Michael Reisey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael's dipped it in cloning gel,
immediately put it into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a couple of days you had pre
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sounds like you're doing it right so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it go for another four days,
steadily increasing flowering activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled it and obviously no roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't had time for roots at that
point, but it said I had no proper rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters or dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it wasn't even in a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's kind of amazing that it lived
this long, uh, over four days in there
[SPEAKER_00]: without a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is this a typical case on sexing
cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it usually happen this quickly and
flower without roots or was I lucky?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would help me and calling males
quickly to see, uh, what meets our laws
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it doesn't usually happen that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got kind of lucky with the
four days, but usually seven to 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to tell if you've got males
or females within that timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think may have happened,
and I think we've corresponded since this,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what I think may have happened,
you may have taken your cuts from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant and the tops are where there
are more hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are a little bit more or the
tops are more ready to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the hormones have moved up to the top
so that the parts you cut were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hell yeah, let's go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he took it away from the main part of
the plant, it kind of went into panic
[SPEAKER_00]: mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't know what the fuck to
do, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the roots away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You change the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it flowered super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a couple of reasons to go into
flower really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is why that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in my experience, that is quicker,
uh, than it's ever happened than I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got lucky there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was a male, that's a powerful,
potent male that I would not breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would skip him because he is too much
male for a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good example of one to toss,
uh, to pass on to get, uh, to let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, um, and then I think you did
respond and say that it was lower
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant was just big enough and it
was happy enough and it was ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower when you did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just had a nice, happy, healthy plant
with a lot of active hormones going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut that clone, you didn't do any
damage to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you potted it and we put that Michael
on the rooting gel on there, you kept it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it just went into flower for you
because it was in the ideal conditions to
[SPEAKER_00]: go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you did something right, man,
because most of the time, if you cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone and do not put it in a dome within a
few days like that, it will wither up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it will fall over and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're onto something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you took good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you remember exactly what you did
so you can do it again and again and
[SPEAKER_00]: again, because this will be a very
effective way to learn how to call those
[SPEAKER_00]: boys from your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a little bit more to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's key or this, uh, not the podcast
to this, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's keep reading so I can put my
brain back on some sort of a track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, Oh, that plant was probably
in panic mode because it got, so it
[SPEAKER_00]: flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the, the bottom line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I love the show and I want
you to know, I will be joining Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No stress on joining Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no rush on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I definitely want to support
everything you do financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be ordering two packs of lemon
sunrise and dragon punch this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next month I will join the army
in full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know 10 bucks a month will not break me,
but I live my life financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do my grow very disciplined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my friend, it is weird times right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, money is not guaranteed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Income is not promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow is not promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can go very straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strangely in these times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you stay disciplined, keep that
wallet tight, keep the budget tight and
[SPEAKER_00]: conserve those funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing okay right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good couple of months,
so don't stress out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, get those seeds, get the garden going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more help, you let me know and
I'll look forward to the Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions, but don't feel like you've
got to contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you notice I'm still reading your
message, still giving you a big salute and
[SPEAKER_00]: a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nothing but love and respect for you
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people had to actually cancel
their Patreon support in the past couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of months because of the Pandy and don't
feel bad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you, uh, it's called grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to have what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to feel love and feel safe and
secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if 10 bucks is going to mess up your
family, your life this month, don't give
[SPEAKER_00]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather you buy 10 more bucks with the
groceries, maybe 10 more bucks worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe 10 more bucks for the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe who knows what it's for,
but if you need it, just use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I'm not going to feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect you either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a seed company that will keep me
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if the Patreon doesn't do it,
the seeds will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seeds don't do it, Patreon will do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those don't fail, some consulting
will cover it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Job will provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys, uh, for the support,
but don't ever feel like you've got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, especially my friend newbie nugs,
get the garden dialed in, live on that
[SPEAKER_00]: tight budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand it is COVID times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can go weird at any moment right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so there's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there is a time empty pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a money envelope dedicated to you just
has to run its course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend's got some time, uh,
empty pots that he could put the seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: and a money envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could start throwing some funding in
so we could help out the Patreon just has
[SPEAKER_00]: to run its course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time has got to run its course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully after this Pandy goes away,
we'll get able to get back, able to play
[SPEAKER_00]: again, get able to make some money again,
live life like we used to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up with thanks for taking the
