[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna shout out our friends and need
love big up big up to easy Oh five seven
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first chatter in today's episode
is a very common thing I see on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media I need to stay off social media
honestly because it's gonna give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking aneurysm But something I want to
talk about when we talk about day one of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower Day one of flower is day one when
you turn that that timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day one of flower That is when you
started flowering So I saw somebody say
[SPEAKER_00]: that the first two weeks don't count the
first week doesn't count You don't start
[SPEAKER_00]: counting until you see hairs or something
Nah, bro, you're the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your control day one is when you
flipped that timer That is when you did it
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is always going to be day one and
people are gonna say why do you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day one because I make the seed
packages, bro I printed the labels on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed pack and I decided that on my seeds
that's day one and all my other breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: friends we talked about it and we had a
little meeting and a powwow and a group
[SPEAKER_00]: and we all realized and decided that we
needed to say day one is the day we turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights to 1212 a lot of you some of
you many of you a few of you I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio Some of the fuckers out there
are gonna be turning the lights off
[SPEAKER_00]: completely for 48 24 hours then going into
flower I think day one is when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: that 1212 on the first time when it comes
on 12 hours on 12 hours off That is now
[SPEAKER_00]: day one people are gonna say what about
day zero and all kinds of weird shit Just
[SPEAKER_00]: quit overthinking it day one is the first
time you put the plants on a 12 hour day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day one a lot of people also talk
about doing weird Transitions I just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned 12 24 hours off 48 hours off
There's not really a downside to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost you anything You're not
getting any light energy and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will transition more quickly, but it's
also not completely necessary also,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with like Tapering down
light cycles they say but that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're not growing outdoors at all
You don't want I in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to just slowly decrease the
amount of time that the lights are on in
[SPEAKER_00]: my room they go from either 20 on and 4
off or 18 on and 6 off straight to 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: boom straight into flower and that is day
one that the day I change that timer Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tomorrow that they're gonna wake up
and do 12 on and 12 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when I will count day one It's
generally a Monday for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flip on Monday It's just easier
to keep track of shit flip on Monday feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on Monday Do all the big work on Monday
catch up on the rest of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the week Alright, so day one is
the day that you flip those plants into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower don't let anybody tell you any
different We're gonna set a standard here
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to agree day one is the
day day one of flower is the day you flip
[SPEAKER_00]: that timer to 1212 We'll touch on veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want I do Sealing or clone
stage and then I do small veg and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: do large veg You can break up the veg
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your Your factory your grow your
farm you get to decide how you want on
[SPEAKER_00]: that So you can label that however you
want my clones Are clones, you know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying their clones as soon as they come
from the cloner They are small veg They're
[SPEAKER_00]: in either a four inch square pot or a six
inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're in a beer cup That is my
small veg once it goes into a one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot That could be medium veg depending on
what I'm doing then it'll go into three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon or a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a seven now I'm in full veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You get to decide When you enter that
veg stage small large veg that is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter because it's your garden
It's just an arbitrary label that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving It that we're not checking on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that really matters is flower day
one a flower is when you flip Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move down the list here another
thing when I'm on the internet and social
[SPEAKER_00]: media another thing that makes me want to
have a small aneurysm is People saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can tell the sex of a seed by
the shape of that seed That's bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: quit believing that quit perpetuating that
quit spreading that just stop it stop it
[SPEAKER_00]: just Fucking stop stop with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell the sex of a seed by the
shape of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that I make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can roll them on the table together You
can tell no difference between the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: and femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hold them one of each side by side
with the magnifying glass You're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to grow them Maybe you could do
some science and cut them open and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA checking and you could tell which seed
is male and female Maybe at that point I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know if you can do it then but
you definitely cannot tell by looking
[SPEAKER_00]: people say that if it's got like a volcano
on the one end or a dimple on one end or
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking no, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you got to grow got to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quit with that shit That is not real
anybody that says that immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: discredits themselves for anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to tell me about cannabis in
the future Alright, so what I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to my next note is that the internet
is full of backseat drivers and armchair
[SPEAKER_00]: quarterbacks take all of that internet
advice you guys with a huge grain of salt
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be quite honest with you even my
Advice, I don't know your grow The advice
[SPEAKER_00]: I give works and I grow in either soilless
mix or cocoa cocoa pots Indoors under LEDs
[SPEAKER_00]: or Gavita lights the advice I give my
knowledge works for what I am doing I try
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it general so it works across the
board But sometimes what I'm doing is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of specific and I try to be specific
Specific about that and let you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you took some of my ideas and you took the
ideas That I give you for an indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and you did that in a greenhouse It may
not work if you did my soil ideas in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just may not work So when you see
people on the internet saying you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this Maybe they're growing in a
completely and different environment
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different method completely
different plan than you so Don't be afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: to do things your way There's no wrong way
to grow cannabis The wrong way is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants die or you get rated that is the
wrong way you get mildew You get bugs you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from that you recover you move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real wrong way If you get a
harvest that you're happy with you did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let people on the internet tell
you you're doing it wrong Especially
[SPEAKER_00]: people that aren't experienced or even me
if you want to do it your way You could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me to go fuck myself and do it your
way and have fun That's one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important parts is have fun in the grow a
Lot of us have made I've been guilty of
[SPEAKER_00]: this I worked in commercial cultivation
for so long that I let growing become
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful There were deadlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were goals that were numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was forgetting about the most important
Part about when somebody smokes this herb,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna feel better That's the most
important part and I was forgetting about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have fun in there But while you're
having fun in there learn don't forget to
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment learn something it brought in
your horizons Just repeating the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle over and over and over that's cool
until you get good at it But once you got
[SPEAKER_00]: your fucking training wheels are there
take off those training wheels and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: do some tricks, bro Let's do some wheelies
and shit So get in there and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let people slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't people let people sway you
experiment Learn take a bunch of notes so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you do something positive or
negative to the plants, you've got notes I
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that all the time grow as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are going to teach you things
about yourself The business will teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: things about yourself You'll learn how to
absorb knowledge how you do learn and do
[SPEAKER_00]: not learn Then you'll go back and you'll
grow the plants and the plants will teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you more things And then when you smoke
them, you learn even more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are incredible to us They can
be greatly therapeutic if you take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the internet does not always know does
not always know your goals your obstacles
[SPEAKER_00]: your Situation your setup when you go
looking for advice on the internet be very
[SPEAKER_00]: leery and be very careful Look to trusted
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of books on the internet
for free You don't have to go to Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: and go to a group and be like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a book out there that has that
answer that was written by a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis grower and an author that knows
what they're talking about You're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of wacky ass answers on Social
media be very careful advice is
[SPEAKER_00]: situational I see a lot of times people
say something like you need to do this and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just comment with why does this
grower need to do that and they'll say I
[SPEAKER_00]: do it and I'll say but I don't so I Eat
fucking vegan food and drink kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that all growers need to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm good at growing Does that mean
that since I drink kombucha and eat
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking vegan that everybody else out
there has to do it to be good at growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does not if I said I eat vegan and
drink kombucha and it makes me a better
[SPEAKER_00]: grower because of this then maybe I've got
some grass some ground to stand on But if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just saying because I do it that's
fucking monkey see monkey do and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no real scientific fucking support behind
that My favorite is when somebody's like
[SPEAKER_00]: well my cousin did it one time and it
worked like it was your cousin growing
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydro was your cousin growing fucking soil
was your cousin growing indoors or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know we got one idea your cousin
said poor fucking biscuits and gravy on it
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sunday and it would go kapow Right,
but man, we don't know what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: biscuits We don't know what kind of gravy
and so we got people fucking up their
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens putting biscuits and gravy out
there on Sunday And it's just messing shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up because one guy's uncle did it one time
and it worked So my advice is very
[SPEAKER_00]: situational what works for your buddies
biscuits and gravy grow may not work for
[SPEAKER_00]: my soil Grow may not work for your hydro
grow may not work for somebody's vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay very close attention then learn the
plants You've got to learn the plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way to do this pay attention to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a Experiment you got to get in
there and fuck up I fucked up recently
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about I had to kill a few
plants because I just wasn't happy with
[SPEAKER_00]: the way they were going But I did an
experiment I learned I know what not to do
[SPEAKER_00]: next time Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I learned the most what not
to do next time I've done a full episode
[SPEAKER_00]: about mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of off on a ramble here,
but I enjoy it I've done a full episode
[SPEAKER_00]: about my mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't post my failures to social media
You only see my victories, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: failures are what have made me a better
grower I don't learn anything if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: successful every time if I don't get a bug
if I don't get a nutrient deficiency If I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't run into an equipment failure What
do I learn and my ego gets ahead of me and
[SPEAKER_00]: I start thinking I can do anything in the
garden I start dancing in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: popping bottles of kombucha and throwing
quinoa flakes in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a fucking party That's just a
hippie joke guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take me too seriously But then I do
shit like I go ahead and replace fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in the middle of winter and then
three days later It's a negative 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have HPS lights in this grow room
to keep the grow warm anymore and all my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants look like shit And nearly die what
I make mistakes like that because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't thinking I've been winning too much
I hadn't taken an L in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking lost that time Learned my big
lesson from that L Anyway, you guys don't
[SPEAKER_00]: be afraid to fail a couple times,
but also set yourself up for success Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let the internet ruin your grow if I say
you should do something research it think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it I'm not the only grower that
knows what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other people you can
cross-reference what I said with them Guru
[SPEAKER_00]: has different approaches to how I grow
Scotty has Different approaches or
[SPEAKER_00]: different approaches then how I grow
Scotty grows differently than I grow Who
[SPEAKER_00]: else out there has a bako panic Steve
potent panic Steve grows completely
[SPEAKER_00]: differently than I grow but we're both
having great success We've both got
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts that could teach you don't be
afraid to cross-reference our knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't be don't be scared to
double-check me Especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a little bit differently than what
I'm used to and what I'm teaching Straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up I do soilless mix or cocoa in about a
three gallon pot If it's a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, I'm using the Vita's if it's a
personal girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using LED If you're doing something
differently, my advice is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit different, you know All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I made my point there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the internet sway you you guys
have a goal have a plan fucking do it I
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of people say can I do this and
I just answer yes a lot of the times
[SPEAKER_00]: because Yes, and then I see people just
trying to fucking crush their dreams Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let the dream crushers crush your dreams,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can Can I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can if you Can't I'm gonna tell
you know that'll kill your plants or no,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do I'll give you a reason why
though I'm not just gonna shit all over
[SPEAKER_00]: your hopes and dreams and say no You can't
do that and you're retarded and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget your helmet No, I'm gonna
tell you why you can't do that Help you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn help you set yourself up for success
Help you have a good grow and let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: why the idea is simply not going to work
before you spend time energy money effort
[SPEAKER_00]: and a broken heart on this crazy
experiment that somebody's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: already done All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way into this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see when I started that much time
Minus that much time means I got plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got a message Where did this one
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like it came from the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes on the I read genetics website at I
read genetics calm There's a grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do ask you a few preliminary questions
We basically ask what strain you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing where you're growing it You and
veg flour what kind of medium you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few details to help me answer your
question It makes it easier for me when
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where this question came from
Got a lot of information it gets down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I love your show so much I listen
to you on the drive to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make Mondays awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Don't forget about Thursday's
says I'm having problems making this post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my message is shorter now, but could
you please talk about enzymes?
[SPEAKER_00]: First off from sorry if the website was
giving you shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were able to post your
questions to the website Maybe I should
[SPEAKER_00]: check on that because I haven't gotten a
question in a minute on there Somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: send me questions on the website go to the
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I'm getting those Um,
I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you please talk about enzymes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will talk about enzymes for you I
wrote notes somewhere here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are they're on this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got scared thought I lost my enzyme
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Can you talk about enzymes and talk
about if I can use them every watering as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to beef up non-feed days or
should I use them every time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um My first reaction to this was microbes
and enzymes every feeding and I just saw
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar signs coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's fucking expensive Dude,
no, you don't need to do that every time
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna get spendy and that's quite
excessive Those are two expensive products
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes and microbes are like the the
turbo charge of your grow and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: those are expensive So I wouldn't use
those every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would use them Once a week and I
would use them separately and alternate
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding So if you feed you're probably
gonna feed gonna feed at least two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three times a week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two or three separate waterings
per week No matter how big your pots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say money You know, I like to
feed on Monday give these bad bitches
[SPEAKER_00]: their main mix and some enzymes or their
main mix and some microbes one or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other Then the next feeding give them
their main mix and the other one whichever
[SPEAKER_00]: one you didn't give them Give it the main
mix then that extra nutrient the enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: or microbes are I'm thinking about the
next feeding the next feeding may just be
[SPEAKER_00]: water I may just give it plain water If
you're in a soilless mix if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa feed it if you're in hydro feed it
But the next time just water and then two
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds then water maybe would be what I
would do but Let's talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: these products these things that you're
asking about Enzymes enzymes basically get
[SPEAKER_00]: in your they've got to be fed in you can't
follow your feed them enzymes get down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the root zone and start breaking up
any dead Anything that's dead funky
[SPEAKER_00]: decaying dying matter that's not going to
be useful to the plant to the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets in there just eats all the dead
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the enzymes will do kind of
works as a cleaner Cleans and breaks down
[SPEAKER_00]: dead shit in your root zone dying roots
the root tips that are dying off If a root
[SPEAKER_00]: grew thought there's gonna be water here
and you quit watering enough to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: water to that zone When you pour those
enzymes in there, they're gonna eat that
[SPEAKER_00]: dead shit that died in there next time To
help clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it moving kind of like a little
louder the the recyclers They're just in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom feeders just cleaning shit up
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enzymes I do not have The
appropriate microscope nor the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: education to tell you if those enzymes are
going to damage your microbes So I feel it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be wise Beneficial to feed them
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen studies that argue that the
enzymes could disrupt the microbes if the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes could disrupt the enzymes I've
also seen studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim they work together So find the
article that you agree with and follow
[SPEAKER_00]: that one, I guess but I would feed them
separately So that is enzymes enzymes get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and clean shit up and break it
down That's why you hear a enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's they're just breaking shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like the little scrubbing
bubbles They're just in there scrubbing
[SPEAKER_00]: and just chewing and just eating just
breaking shit down then now let's talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about Microbes we've got a couple of
different kinds of microbes that come in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind when we were talking about growing
cannabis We got mycorrhizal fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria These things have a
lot of different functions when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to plants These are the things that
basically work between the earth and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant They're the communicator between
your plants root zone and the dirt these
[SPEAKER_00]: things pick up a lot of signals They tell
the plant a lot of things they deliver a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things they provide a lot Of
different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different types of
microbes and fungi that they all have
[SPEAKER_00]: different jobs But also can perform each
other's jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am NOT the microbe expert my friends
Scotty and guru are Fucking overloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: with microbe knowledge ask them about
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a long long episode They're
passionate about microbes, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes basically help buffer your soil
or soilless mix they help deliver the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients To the plants they help the
plants decide which nutrients they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They what else do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote something else Oh, they also help
convert nutrients into usable food
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when we're pouring certain
things into the the rhizosphere there into
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients into the root zone Some of
those things aren't readily available for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants those little microbes go Oh,
I got this little thing here and I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this to it Womp Womp Womp and it does a
little magic trick and the plant goes Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can eat that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro So it's like just a little
a little buffer a little in between
[SPEAKER_00]: between The root zone the earth so to
speak and the root of the plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are the part that talked to that
they're basically So if the the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are the I'm trying to pick which into this
relationship I want to be it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: drive-through window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the restaurant You got the person
coming up to the drive-through the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are the pimply faced kid passing
the burger through the window Or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to Starbucks, it's the beautiful
barista passing the the coffee over the
[SPEAKER_00]: window That's the microbe for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they provide that relationship They
take the money they say hey, we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: give this person this Stomachache fucking
toothache caramel caffeine Expendee and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they take the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making up Starbucks drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't think of one off the top of my
head But they do the exchange for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they take the money and then
they give you the drink and they send you
[SPEAKER_00]: on your way So that's what microbes are
doing and once again you guys I am NOT the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a microscope or a PhD I do
have grow experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I think I am valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that These plants on a not
like a science level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get them and I can teach you that
way Anyway, I'm not trying to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: myself here But I'm just kind of talking a
little bit about microbes and enzymes with
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of understanding that I've got
trying to let you understand So I would
[SPEAKER_00]: not use those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expensive dude micro products and
enzymatic products can be very expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't use them every watering that's
gonna get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's that there's no it's
not necessary There's no need for that but
[SPEAKER_00]: do Feed them on separate days most of the
microbe products you can follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions with the dosage rate You're
not gonna overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't overdo it with microbes The only
thing you're doing is wasting money when
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets to be too expensive enzymes I
don't know if you could overfeed maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they could cause damage I've never gotten
that far with an enzymatic product product
[SPEAKER_00]: before but I hope I answered your question
This one did come from our buddy PT Brad
[SPEAKER_00]: PT Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question I hope we
rescued your strawberry shortcake and
[SPEAKER_00]: banana diesel if you've got any More
questions.
