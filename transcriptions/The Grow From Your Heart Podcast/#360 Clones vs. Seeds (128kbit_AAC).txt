[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 360 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Bubble Jack FSE
from Fuego Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor just lingers on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little information printed on
the side of the package here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lab test that says 71.83% max
THC, 2.85% CBGA, and it's got 9.98%
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bubble gum cotton candy flavor that
just lingers on the tongue is perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that head high that goes straight
to the brain and keeps you rambling,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps you motivated is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big two thumbs up to the Bubble Jack
Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy smoking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's keep moving
this show forward because I have got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get back into the grow
lessons on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the eighth lesson in a
long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we've talked about our goals and
ideas and where to set up our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone over the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about our containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about soil and medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not caught up, I recommend
you go back to episode 351 and start
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of interruptions in the
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will sneak in a few episodes that are
not grow lessons while I'm doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll need to read emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll need to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up, we're going to have some iTunes
customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that will disrupt the lessons,
but I think it keeps the shows fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me motivated and it keeps it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this episode, we will continue the
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's talk about
a couple of things I kind of overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: while we were talking about building our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a good idea to add a smoke
detector to each grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you've got a grow light hanging,
have a smoke detector in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend a fire
extinguisher outside of each grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I hope you don't have to use it,
but if that smoke alarm goes off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would rather have that fire
extinguisher outside of the grow room so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to open the door,
run in there, get the fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_00]: then start working on the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's outside of the grow room,
you can just grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a little more prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start putting out the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've never used a fire
extinguisher, maybe read the instructions,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe understand what to do in case of a
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just read that little book that
comes with it and also make sure it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a gauge on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a red, a yellow and a green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your little arrow is in the
green at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to think about some sort of
automated fire suppression system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make things that hang in the middle
of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little heat sensor in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too hot, it basically explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It releases a powder that rains down into
the grow room that will put out any fire
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about some sort of way to detect and
suppress a fire in your grow room should
[SPEAKER_00]: that situation occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I overlooked when we were
designing and building our room was an
[SPEAKER_00]: automated watering or an assisted watering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: An automated watering system can really
speed things up once you get into a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes the plants really happy
because the plants love consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in designing an auto
watering system, I did a full episode
[SPEAKER_00]: about auto watering on episode 335.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there were some audio
technical difficulties and parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode chop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to that episode and you
still have specific questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: get your auto water system dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so at this point, we should
have goals and reasonable expectations for
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good idea of where we
wanna put the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good idea of the gear we
wanna buy, the lights, the pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should also have a good idea of pest
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've talked a little bit about fire
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done an in-depth episode on fire
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is episode 260.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna learn a lot about fire safety
in your grow, episode number 260 will
[SPEAKER_00]: teach you a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide you wanna add an auto
watering system to your grow, episode 335
[SPEAKER_00]: is the episode all about auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should get us all caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the gear planned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good idea of pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what we're gonna feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to take care of a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to set up an auto watering
system if we need one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting to the fun part of this
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start thinking about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you wanna grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you wanna dedicate your time,
your energy, your space, and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to over the next 90 to 120 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains have gotten your attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains do you really enjoy smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does something work for you medically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does something work for you
recreationally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something that is reliable that
every time you smoke it, you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna fall back to the very first
episode of this grow lesson series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing this for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing it for a medical patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of things to think about
when it comes to deciding what strains to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: In legal, medical, and recreational
states, we have a lot more options for
[SPEAKER_00]: acquiring genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to a dispensary and buy a clone
off of the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to our friend's garden and ask
them for clones, and they can give,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell, or trade those clones to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can acquire clones here very easily in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I went to a dispensary just a few
days ago to pick up these Fuego extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had two different variety of
clones on the shelf that looked very
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Purple Punch and Dosey Dose on
the shelf, ready to go at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clones are readily available in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are also available in some Colorado
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk right into the store,
you can grab a pack of seeds, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start your new garden from seeds you
picked up at your local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones and seeds are both viable options
for starting a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to focus on the
great debate on seeds versus clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into that, let's talk a
little bit about how you can decide what
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do that is to smoke a
bunch of different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a medical or
recreational state, that is a lot easier
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you were in Prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Prohibition land,
who knows if the strain you were buying is
[SPEAKER_00]: even really what whoever is selling it to
you is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably growing something,
and they're calling everything cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: because cookies sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with the letters O-G at the end
of it sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably got something cookies
O-G, anything with the word fire in there
[SPEAKER_00]: works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably, you guys are probably
buying fire cookies O-G in Prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably whatever that person got a
clone of, or whatever that person's buying
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk of, and they're just renaming it
because they know that names are hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a Prohibition state, it's going to
be a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get a seed in your bag of
weed one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always grow out those bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you find phenotypes very close
to what you started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes you find hermaphrodites
and problematic plants, so be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it is your only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always an awkward situation asking a
grower for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: For clones, if you're a new grower and
you're buying herb from somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like, bro, I really love this
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think I could get a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: That always presents an awkward situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, now you both know you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a Prohibition state,
that makes things really weird for both of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the guy doesn't want to release his
genetics to you because now he's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're on a really friendly
basis with your weed guy, I would avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a legal state, in a recreational or
a medical state, it's really easy to go
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what strains work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the dispensary and you buy as
many grams as you can afford of different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and you go home and you smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start fresh every day and you try this
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't smoked this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke strain A and you take a few
notes and you see how it works for you
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a target, if you're trying
to make your leg pain go away,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're trying to make your headache go
away, if you're trying to make your back
[SPEAKER_00]: pain go away, if you're trying to make
your anxiety go away, document the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of which that ailment starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a five?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that at a 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I started off with a level five leg
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a bowl of this strain A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my leg pain is at a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I woke up, leg pain's at a
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked strain B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my leg pain is still at a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously don't want to buy any more of
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to go the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day number three, I woke up, my leg pain's
at a six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm at a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one might work well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put a little star by that and
remember what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just keep doing little tests like
that on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the flowers and find out what
strain works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a strain at one dispensary,
it works very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find it at another dispensary and
smoke that product because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have different clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their product is going to come out very
different in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we start with the same clone,
two commercial grows will produce two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try them both and see if it's the
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've just been that one batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've just been that one grow,
but try different batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds like I'm completely
spoiled, but this is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drive to 10 dispensaries in my area
and probably five of them have wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wedding cake was probably grown
by three different grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you, if I try all three of them,
they're all going to have very subtle
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will taste a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to burn a little different and
one's going to have a better high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're all going to have that wedding
cake, droopy eye, giggly kind of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to check them out from different
grows if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it's the strain and not
just that one grower that did it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to loop back on,
we talked about trying to get a clone from
[SPEAKER_00]: your grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do try to buy a clone from your
grower friend, don't be offended when he
[SPEAKER_00]: hits you with a really steep price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been selling you herb for how long?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to grow your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much money are you taking out of his
pocket?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to save that much
money, but that guy's been relying on you
[SPEAKER_00]: as a customer and now you're going to try
to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to go, dude, this guy's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put a fat chunk in his
pocket as a parting gift when he gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he needs so much for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he's the only one growing that in
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he's living.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he's making his income.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to buy it into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That genetic is going to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does he know you're not going to run a
bunch of it and flood the town with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they hit you with a really high
price for a clone in a prohibition state,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why it's because that's how that
person is living.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is his income.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably phenohunted that or he paid
a whole lot of money for that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's sharing his revenue stream with
you and kind of opening up the floodgates
[SPEAKER_00]: to put himself out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you guys do a phenohunt and you've
found your own keeper, you'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: understand a little bit more, especially
in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, we've talked a little
bit about deciding what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to grow is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you decide what you want to grow,
if you pick something that takes 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and it grows tall and skinny,
if that's really what you think you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow, you're going to have to adapt to
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to make that plant adapt to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got a bunch of notes,
but I don't have a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just jump right into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the debate on seeds
versus clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've decided what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you want to grow it from seed or
from clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing from either seed or clone,
both have their advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you'll have to think about with
both of them is availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are clones available where you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does somebody in your area grow that is
willing to release clones to you for your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a dispensary in your area that
sells clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read correctly, in Canada,
you can ship clones to each other through
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if nobody has clones near you,
they are not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if somebody does have clones,
are they accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the variety you're looking
for and are they clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same story with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know somebody that's got seeds that
is willing to share some with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get them from somebody,
are they accurately labeled and do they
[SPEAKER_00]: have the variety that you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the advantages of seeds is that
there are shops on the internet that will
[SPEAKER_00]: send seeds directly to your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a prohibition state and you
order seeds from an online vendor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is your responsibility to keep those
seeds in the packaging and do not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: them to grow if it is illegal to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save them as souvenirs and collectibles
until legalization happens in your area or
[SPEAKER_00]: until you move to a legalized state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are several online vendors who
will send you seeds to keep as
[SPEAKER_00]: collectibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to germinate those and
grow those yourself, that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that happens from that is up to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seeds are available online and seeds
don't die in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to do a friendly debate on
clone versus seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to keep it fair, we need to act like
there is a place where we can go that has
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and seeds available in just about
any variety we could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the strain that you chose you
want to grow for your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's imagine there's a dispensary where
we can go and they've got flowers of that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain grown by three different growers so
we can smoke it from three different
[SPEAKER_00]: people and make sure it's what we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got extracts there,
so if you're into smoking concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got full spectrum extract,
they've got shatter, they've got wax,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got whatever you're into that way
so you can make sure it's the strain you
[SPEAKER_00]: desire for your concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, they have got seeds and clones
of your favorite strain ready for you
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to buy seeds or clones for
your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start a friendly debate right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I get too far into this,
let me give a quick explanation on what a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure most people know what a
seed is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bean that grows into a big
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone is basically a photocopy of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a cutting off of a plant and it
roots and now we have a photocopy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are annuals, which means
they only live for one year or one cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow it from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: By taking a clone, we can have that plant
again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can have repeatable, reliable
outcomes and a reliable product from each
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a clone is basically a genetic
photocopy of a reliable plant in the form
[SPEAKER_00]: of just a tiny little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about clones and we'll talk
about phenohunting a lot more as these
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the pros and
cons of seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros of growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best parts about growing from
seed is there are no bugs and no
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get free powdery mildew with
your new clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All too often people give out clones that
are infested with spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: with russet mites, with aphids,
with thrips or with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an option with a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's also put that in the cons
category when it comes to growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the disadvantages of starting from
clones is that they may come with bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about one of my favorite
parts about growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing from seed allows me to find custom
tailored phenotypes that work perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: for what I'm looking for medically and
perfectly for what I'm looking for in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows the height I want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows for as long as I want it to grow
and it gives me medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the effect that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing from seed allows me to find
something completely unique for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: that works perfectly for my garden and my
medical needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con to that is it does take time for a
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to run the batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to find the plant that works for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there was one in that batch that
was exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I keep searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the downside to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will do an episode on phenohunting
in the future that is lined up in this
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the advantages is that I can
find perfectly custom tailored phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that work for myself and my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con to that is that it does take time
for a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to run the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to grow them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to dry them, cure them,
smoke them and see which ones I enjoyed,
[SPEAKER_00]: see which ones I didn't enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when I run a 10 pack, I find two
or three that I want to run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll repeat the process and eliminate
it to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that does take time, money and energy
to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there may be males, there may be
hermaphrodites and there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable phenotypes in that test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the quality of the seeds
and the experience of the breeder and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of the work, I may not find the
phenotype I'm looking for in a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take more than 10 seeds to find the
desirable phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I've got reliable seeds and the
breeder did his work and I've done my job
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, I may find something in there
that is amazing and I may find something
[SPEAKER_00]: in there that nobody else has,
which will set me apart from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing for production to put on
the street, having a very unique strain
[SPEAKER_00]: would set me apart from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got the frostiest, dankest strain
on the market, people are going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy that first, which means I'm going to
make more sales, which means maybe I can
[SPEAKER_00]: charge a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that perfectly selected
phenotype that grows exactly the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to, it grows perfectly for my grow
and it works perfect for my area,
[SPEAKER_00]: for my market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great advantage of growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of growing from seed is
that there is a huge variety available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we talked about this imaginary
store where everything is available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not like that in all places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seed banks online that make
many, many varieties of seeds from very
[SPEAKER_00]: many reputable breeders available to
people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed availability is a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody can get their hands on
clean, reliable, accurately labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to order seeds from a seed
bank is definitely advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the downside to that is seeds can be
kind of expensive depending on the vendor
[SPEAKER_00]: and the breeder seeds can have a huge
markup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're working with regular seeds,
you may lose 60% of your crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: right when you switched to flower,
because you're going to have male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buying seeds can get expensive and you
also need to have a reliable breeder and a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable vendor so that you know you were
getting what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus more on growing from
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the advantages or pros of
growing from a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: If properly selected, that clone is a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If properly selected, that clone is known
to put out high potency and to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: without any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that being said, we have to rely on a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the cons of growing from
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to grow the seeds and find
the keeper plants out of those seed
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they chose the stellar keeper to
pass on as clones to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dispensary, what usually happens is
I'll cut 120 clones for my next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only need 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually send those 20 to the store
so that I don't have to throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them on a manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send them to the store and those are
made available for shoppers in the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're buying a clone from a
dispensary and it's accurately labeled,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably getting the same exact cut
as they're growing and putting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know that those clones have been
properly phenohunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that those clones are proven
females with proven potency and have
[SPEAKER_00]: proven themselves to be resistant to bugs
and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage to growing from a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage to that is who knows who
selected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just getting it from some dude
on Craigslist, who knows how discerning
[SPEAKER_00]: his eye was, maybe his idea of amazing bud
and your idea of amazing bud are two
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when working with a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of working with a clone
is we have an idea of what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said before, somebody phenohunted
this clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've grown it out a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that it's going to have high
potency, either high CBD, high THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a beautiful ratio of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an idea of what type of
growth patterns to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get real tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get real bushy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to stretch out real bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to need a lot of water?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a good idea of how long it
will take to finish because our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and partners have probably grown this cut
several times before they gave it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main advantage to growing from
clone is that you've got a proven female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about calling
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant you put in there is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested for vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if we need sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if we need trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how often to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if we can overfeed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if it likes a high or a low pH,
and we already know how many days to let
[SPEAKER_00]: it flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge advantage from working
with a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can always call the guy and say,
hey, bro, this plant's doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen this strain do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll say, oh yeah, man, I grew that
like 10 times before I gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably just need more CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got some sort of history,
some sort of experience with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he can help you diagnose a problem if
one does arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge advantage of working with
a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one disadvantage, the number
one con to bringing clones into your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden is most of the time they are
infested with bugs and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower likes to say, my grow is
immaculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a single bug in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of 10, those guys are
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that boast most about having the
pest free garden are the ones that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the pests are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that say, no, I've got a little
bit of spider mites, they're the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: are paying attention, that are actually
checking and they know that those bugs are
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a clone, you're probably going
to get some sort of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody also likes to say, my buddy
wouldn't give me clones with pests on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't even know they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't check.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not paying enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just trying to make $5 a clone by
selling them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't care if you get spider mites or
not because you're going to need more
[SPEAKER_00]: clones in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside to clones is they come
with free bugs quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get spider mites, you get free root
aphids, you get free white flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get free fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really lucky, sometimes you
even get free powdery mildew with your new
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disadvantage to growing from clone
is everybody already has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just growing this strain for
yourself, for your medical needs or for a
[SPEAKER_00]: loved one's medical needs and that strain
works perfectly for you, that is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were growing for a market
reason, and everybody has that strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to be a better grower
than everybody else growing it to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your product stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're just another guy selling
weed on the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a standout strain,
you will blend in just like everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing the same clone that
all of your competition is growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've really got to be the best grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the downsides to growing
from clone is everybody's got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, that's why some growers are
tight with their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some guys won't let clones out
because they're the only one growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that, you've got to go to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always got some income because
their product stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another downside to working with
clones is they can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something in me says that you get what
you pay for when it comes to clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to Craigslist and paying
three to five dollars for a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get a three to five dollar
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be what you're looking for,
but how healthy is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How good of a start did it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many bugs does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones that I saw at the dispensary
recently were in four by four cubes of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones were about six or eight inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were forty dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to buy six of those,
that's going to add up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you throw down two hundred and forty
dollars every time you want to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: A package of seeds is way cheaper than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find the males and you have to
find the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage with clone is somebody has
already done all of that work for you so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can charge you forty bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the disadvantages to growing
from clone is that they are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're getting them from a friend,
they can add up in cost quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've seen clones go from
anywhere from five or ten bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw those clones at the dispensary the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a purple punch and a dosey dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were forty dollars each.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon for me to see a clone
sell for the five hundred to one thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are stories of certain cuts
being sold for ten to twenty five thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, depending on what strain we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rumors of astronomical numbers,
but I don't know how much of that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the people in the Bay have
paid ridiculous prices for some of the O
[SPEAKER_00]: .G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush's and some of the more well known
strands that the rappers rap about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and cookie crosses went for big money
when they first hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have built entire empires and
businesses off of those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clones can get quite expensive quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disadvantage to clones is are they
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody in your area have clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody you trust have clones
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do get clones, are they
accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your friends what clones they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask for a specific strain,
because if you ask for wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_00]: now your friend suddenly has wedding cake
and he needs big money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask what strains he's got
available, he'll give you a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them the option to invent a
name or slap a label on something just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're willing to throw some money
their direction for that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick debate on seed versus
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over it really quickly again and
recap the pros of growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bugs, no pests, no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't start off with somebody else's
problems in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage is that you can select
perfectly selected phenotypes that work
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, nobody else is going to have your
phenotype, which will give you better
[SPEAKER_00]: market value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cons of growing from seed is
that it takes time for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow them and find out what
you've got and select a keeper and then
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also need to call males and
undesirable phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also a little bit expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also is the strain you want available in
seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older stuff may not be
available anymore because breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: always evolving and creating new stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you have to think about is
are the seeds accurately labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you being sold?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're paying for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about clones really quickly
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros, you have got proven potent
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to plan for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the downsides to working with
clones are you get those bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get those pathogens, you get free
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, everybody else in the area has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is already growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing exciting about it unless
it's cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my quick friendly unbiased debate
on seeds versus clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, being a breeder, I want you to
buy seeds and I want you to buy them at
[SPEAKER_00]: dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want you to do a pheno hunt and
find the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about pheno hunting in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also talk about cutting our own
clones in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, once you've acquired clones or
seeds, you can do a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can select the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can cut clones off of that keeper
and we can be self-sustainable and not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to acquire genetic material from
other sources unless we decide to add
[SPEAKER_00]: something new to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a long episode about what to
expect from a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would make great supplemental
listening to this episode.
