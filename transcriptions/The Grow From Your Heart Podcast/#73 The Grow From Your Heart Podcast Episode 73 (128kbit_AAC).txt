[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back Cannabis Community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 73 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thanks to Kat Coupe and the entire
Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn that music down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn it down a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get the party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of getting the party started,
big shout out to my friends Deez,
[SPEAKER_00]: Roxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who else is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check on something real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk more about this later maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Cody and shout out to Cody,
another Cody, two Cody's and Roxy also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of friends of mine that are
watching me record this show live right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't hear the show, but they are
watching me record it on my webcam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the chat room getting pumped up,
just getting a little energy before the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, taking a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, why turn off the cam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just let those guys watch?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys hear this, this is the
episode that you're watching that you
[SPEAKER_00]: watched past tense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shout out to the BonkTV crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no ads for this episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going to do any
commercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been promising you guys a lesson on
how to set up a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it figured out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, my arms are a little bit rubbery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working through my paperwork here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played my drums for about a good solid
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I beat the shit out of those drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played the drums in quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to make some space where the
drums were for some grow things,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I had that space available,
set up a big ... I'm just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the drum set on the podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to tell you more about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an eight, a 10, a 12,
a 14, 16 inch toms, a 22 inch kick drum,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 14 inch snare drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tore the shit out of that kit all
day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find the notes here that are
in my phone and we will talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lesson that I wrote for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to the point here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to talk through the
dabness here for a minute and find my way
[SPEAKER_00]: through these clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Mystic Reads crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 73, scheduling a perpetual flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're scheduling a perpetual grow,
a few things you need to keep in mind are
[SPEAKER_00]: things like your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a medical state like
Colorado, where I am, you have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count and you have to stay within that to
be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a good way to help you stay
within your plant count and produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of medicine or recreational
cannabis you need to supply yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you need to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much herb do you require to keep
yourself applied without trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stingy, without trying to make a bunch of
money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you realistically want to grow
and how often do you need to grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be something we're going
to talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we will talk about how much space
it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what will really dictate your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this stuff is covered in previous
episodes, you guys, but we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back over a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end, you will have a perpetual grow
going if you follow this, I guess it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe I wrote here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, holy shit, excuse my throat
clearing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This perpetual lesson is going to be based
on one 1,000 watt flowering light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This covers about a four by four or a five
by five square foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to create a perpetual grow
that suits your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using more lights, simply
multiply this method by however many
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you're using or however you seem
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, email me,
growfromyourheart.hotmail.com and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: help adjust this recipe for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you about my perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a four light setup and I fill the
whole light area with a set of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest one light every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where you need to make a decision
on your perpetual setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to decide if you want to start a
crop under a light and finish the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and then have another set of plants
ready as soon as that's done for you so
[SPEAKER_00]: that as soon as you chop down that room,
that light of plants, you have plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow in veg in another room as soon
as they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to refill the entire room or
do you want to stagger it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little, in my opinion,
I like having a perpetual instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: having a whole bunch of herb to harvest
all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a really daunting task in my
opinion to try to harvest four lights
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of cannabis all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh guys, excuse my throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll go away here after a couple of
minutes, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you're working with one
string, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you need to decide if you want to
start the whole crop and run the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stagger your crops so you have
a harvest every 30 days or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with one strain,
that's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got multiple strains,
try to get strains that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to time it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get strains that are all about
eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your ideal setup for a perpetual
cycle under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal here is to have the rooms
moving constantly with as little downtime
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible to keep your production at its
maximum without any interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have any interruptions
in your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you guys, let's see,
I talked a little bit about my four light.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal grow is a perpetual setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvest one light every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, I'd rather trim one
light worth of buds, which for me is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound, than four lights, which would be
four pounds easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a pound and a half,
sometimes it's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what strains I'm
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm harvesting every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that every two weeks I'm cutting
clones, I'm doing transplants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking clones out of the cloner,
putting them into cups, and I'm harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have four flowering lights in my
flowering area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two lights in my vegging area and I
have a separate light for my moms and
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about every 14 days, I cut 12
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 14 days, those clones go into cups
and go under a light in my mom and clone
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be like a T5 or a metal halide
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even an LED if you're into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants that I cut will stay in the
cups for about two weeks before they're
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I'm gonna give you a lot of
detail about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going kind of fast right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you a setup on mine and then
I'll get into a lot of detail in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can fit 12 seven gallon pots under my
two veg lights comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them enough space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, some of these are,
we got shit all the way from one week up
[SPEAKER_00]: to eight weeks old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones on the far end there,
they're real little, so we can squish
[SPEAKER_00]: those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other ones over there on that end
are a little larger, so they need more
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fit 12 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants are in the seven gallon
pots, they'll hang out in the bedroom for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 30 to 45 days, depending on the
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna set up this perpetual,
it'll probably work out to exactly eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks if you do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use large pots so I can keep big plants
and keep my plant count down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking about earlier,
Colorado is limited by plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting as much from each plant is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as you can from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant count is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have four sets of seven gallon pots
under my veg lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have plants in veg for two,
four, six, and eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants that have been in veg for
eight weeks will go into the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: on week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more plants will be dropped into seven
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be slid over four spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the empty spaces I just made will be
replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be tetrised all right over the
left so that it's right by the door to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, every two weeks I'm
harvesting a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cutting more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting clones into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting cups into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm keeping the cycle moving while
maintaining a pest management regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lolly popping these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work to do in there you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just slack off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of work and it pays off
every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pound of herb harvested for
myself every two weeks if I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically my setup there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might not have four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about getting your perpetual
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta reach over and plug this phone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so to have a perpetual grow,
you'll need a solid mother plant or a
[SPEAKER_00]: source of reliable clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna rely on somebody else for
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely recommend keeping a
mother plant if you have a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I haven't talked thoroughly
enough about mother plants, I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: write a note right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write a note to talk about mother
plants in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can kind of talk about keeping
a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a whole nother episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Writing it down, mother plant episode,
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, it takes me a long time to write,
but I'd rather be able to read it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, mother plants, I wrote that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a good mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about selecting a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go way into depth on that for you if
I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this mother plant, for the mother
plant, you need a light cycle that stays
[SPEAKER_00]: on in a vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend, of course, the 18 on and six
off, or you can try 19.5 if that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that because I see the plants growing
and it keeps any sativas from autophagy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some sativas that like to
autoflower if the light cycle changes just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that 19.5, that extra hour,
will keep them from doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep your mother plants and
your clones and these cups on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one light, you can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one good size fluorescent
light, you can fit your cloner and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of cups with clones in there underneath
that T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can probably fit a good size
mother plant underneath there also,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know two of those T5 fixtures would
definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so for this example,
Mike and I were talking and of course I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to ask Mike for some help because I
was getting stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike for helping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up with the idea to use two five
by five grow tents because that's when he
[SPEAKER_00]: met me, I was grown in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned a lot from those grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using two of those five by five
grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have grow tents, you can use
a bedroom or whatever and you can divide
[SPEAKER_00]: it into two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your flowering space is totally
dark during the night cycle, you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress enough how important it is
to have a totally dark night cycle in your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna use two five by five tents,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can divide it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is a flowering hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a veg space, one's a flowering hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got the one flowering
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five by five with a thousand watt
light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other room is a five by five room or
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be our veg and mom space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so it's actually gonna take a
couple of weeks to get your perpetual grow
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing and productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it starts, the flow should run
perfectly if you plan ahead and stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of your chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get lazy, don't get complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stay in there and be on top of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my example, we're gonna set up a
perpetual grow to harvest one large plant
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your goal is four ounces per plant
with this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna put one seven gallon pot
under the light every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start with a mother plant or
some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we'll start with a
healthy mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have your mom's, your mom rooms
or huts built and running before we even
[SPEAKER_00]: take the first clone for the perpetual
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your rooms happy and your
mother plant is nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we cut clones to start our cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using like rapid
rooters or if you're using rockwool cubes
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're using an easy cloner,
but either way, two weeks is your due date
[SPEAKER_00]: for these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be rooted and ready to rock
in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not proficient in cloning,
I would recommend cutting these clones
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take some practice, get some practice
and get some clones going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one 1,000 watt flowering light in a
five by five area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what would happen on week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would cut clones and let them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if for this one light situation,
we only need one clone out of this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut some clones and hopefully in 14
days, one of those clones is rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now week two, you don't have much to do
except make sure the clones are rooted and
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week three of the perpetual cycle,
you're going to take more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first you have to, I guess,
take the clones out of the cloning area,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into cups, and then you're also
going to cut more clones for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're only going to need one keeper
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those clones that you just put into
cups, you're going to let them go for 14
[SPEAKER_00]: more days and then you'll just pick the
best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clones that you just put in the
cloner in 14 days, you're going to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the best one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we only need one at a time
to survive, but cut extras, you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's always better to have some to
choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week four, week four is another chill
week, but make sure the cups and the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones are happy and as healthy as you can
make them and the mother plant you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't add that in here, you guys,
we're going to need to make love to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in there and trim that sexy
bitch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess taking clones every two weeks,
you'll be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should have made a note of.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week five is where we start to get busy,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to put the clones into cups of
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to cut more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only need one keeper, like I said,
every two weeks, but I would take a few
[SPEAKER_00]: extras and choose from the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote that down a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that we put into cups two weeks
ago will now go into seven gallon pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: go under the veg lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in that five by five hut,
you should have plenty of room for your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant, a little bit of clones,
a couple of cups, and four seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in week five, we're going to put one
seven gallon pot under the veg lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to sit there for eight weeks,
you guys, but now you have your first veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing some progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that one little itty bitty plant
in a seven gallon pot and it's only taken
[SPEAKER_00]: five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week six is kind of another chill week,
but you have to make sure all your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now you're really setting the pace
for your productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to watch for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start doing any pruning and training that
you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting good on your
cloning game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a lot of practice by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just start perfecting shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start really paying attention to details
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a rhythm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying attention to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at about 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, after a couple of edits here,
we should be at about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week seven, we need to put the clones
out of the cloning area into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to cut more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, guys, we just need one,
but cut several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need to put another clone into a
seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that goes under that veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have two of our first four
plants under the veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one has seven more weeks or
no, it's got yeah, we're going on odd
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would have six more weeks to cook
before it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one's got a few more weeks to
cook before it's going to go into the veg
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's now got eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other one's got six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because we're going to be harvesting
every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week eight is another week to focus on
training and pruning and plant health and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your mother plant happy,
checking for bugs, going in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up the bottoms of all the plants
that are in the vegging area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff to do every week,
even though we're not doing the big cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: on the even numbered weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week nine, I'm sure you're catching on
by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the clones out of the cloner,
put them into cups, cut new clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a clone from a cup into a seven gallon
pot and into the veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got three seven gallon pots
under the veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is getting big and bushy by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost time to flower that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do any topping or anything
or any pruning to it, now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 10 is another off week, but it's a
good time to check for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going at it for 10 weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check all of your equipment out,
clean up all your fans, make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and clean everything up
on week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 11, here we go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put clones into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put our favorite clone into
a seven gallon pot and put that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have got four seven gallon pots
in your room is full and we will flower
[SPEAKER_00]: out our first plant in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds like a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take us 13 weeks to flower
our first plant before we even start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering our first plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me, once you get this rhythm
going, it's totally going to be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week 12, this is the last week before
we start flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your bloom room is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that five by five flowering room
cleaned up sparkly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the floor is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the ceiling is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you did go in there and clean it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, clean it one more
time and then inspect it one more time and
[SPEAKER_00]: find what you missed because there's
something that you missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a fire extinguisher near your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a smoke detector near your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably two things you forgot
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to say what could
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm getting at, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a smoke detector, put it near your
grow, get a fire extinguisher and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the room so that in the worst
case scenario, you don't have to run in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to get the fire extinguisher to put
the fucking fire out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it outside of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just do that for me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your room is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first day we start the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today you get to move that largest plant
into the flowering room and begin the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in eight to nine weeks,
hopefully 60 days, we'll have buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every two weeks after that,
you can harvest if you keep this rhythm
[SPEAKER_00]: going properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious about the scheduling of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fuck this up, you will be way
behind and everything will fall apart
[SPEAKER_00]: because you will miss a beat and you won't
know where to jump back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like playing a really fast song and
once you jumped off that beat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to take a minute to recover and
your lungs and your smoking habits are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely going to notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move that big plant that you've been
working on that's been in veg for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant was in veg for eight weeks,
in a cup for two weeks and in a cloner for
[SPEAKER_00]: two other weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve weeks of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just now moving that sucker
into the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you move that into the flowering
room, feed it its flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feed it flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about what to feed and stuff
on week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed that plant its flowering
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to, you guessed it,
take a clone out of the cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into a cup, cut more clones,
put your favorite cup into a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and replace that seven gallon pot that
you just moved into the flowering room
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fresh pot and a little baby plant
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got one plant in flower and
you should have four plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our goal is to keep this moving and
add a plant into the room every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to cut clones, put clones into
cups, put a cup into a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: drag a fresh plant into the flowering room
every two weeks and eventually you will
[SPEAKER_00]: also be harvesting a plant every two weeks
if you're running a 56 to 60 day strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if that went right, that means that
every two weeks you'll be pulling off
[SPEAKER_00]: about a quarter pound of herb for yourself
if you do this properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will become a small part time job for
yourself to maintain this, but the more
[SPEAKER_00]: work and love you put into it,
the better your product will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, how is your herb so
good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I go in the grow room for
hours every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch every single plant with my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look on the bottoms of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk in there in the morning and I'm
like, which plant haven't I spent enough
[SPEAKER_00]: time with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pick one and I turn the leaves
upside down and I look at the bottoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves and make sure there are no
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look around the room and I just
stare into the room like an old guy
[SPEAKER_00]: staring off the porch into nothing,
but I'm looking around the room to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a problem that maybe I didn't miss
or maybe if there's something I could
[SPEAKER_00]: tweak to make the air flow a little bit
better to control the temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity just a little bit better when I'm
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be in there, do some work, keep on top
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the fuck started
that rant, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after eight weeks, it'll be time to
harvest that first plant that you put into
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need a few extra days for the plant
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just squeeze that plant in there for the
last few days or if you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: available, put that plant in its own dark
room for two days before you harvest it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will kind of dense up the buds and
I think it'll kind of make it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it does make it kind of more dense
is the word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tightens up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 48 hours of dark kind of shocks the
plant and makes it kick out the last bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of resin that it can put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting freaked out, it knows it's
gonna die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you should have a full perpetual
setup that should yield three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces of herb every two weeks and if you
do this right, you can keep your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count down to like 10 or 15 if you only
have one mother plant and you get good at
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning because you're gonna have four in
flower and then you're gonna have four in
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's eight plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your mother plant and then
you've got that one that's in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 10 plants right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a couple of extra clones and
have a couple of extra mother plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, that's gonna put you up near 15
or 20 but dude, you're pulling a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: pound of herb with 10 plants in your house
and you're using two, maybe three lights
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna work for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your other option here would be to veg
all four of your plants for 30 to 45 days
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw them all into the flowering room
and it's a good idea but like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, when it comes to harvesting all
that pot, you're hopefully gonna pull off
[SPEAKER_00]: a pound of wheat here you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a pound and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, I just burped that root beer
right into the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root, root, root rockstar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hoping to pull a pound and a
quarter or pound and a half herb off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather trim three to five ounces
every two weeks and give my wrist a break
[SPEAKER_00]: than be at it trimming for two weeks
straight because it gets crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start cutting down plants and they're
all ripe at the same time and so you got
[SPEAKER_00]: shit drying all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta trim this whole pound of herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim usually myself and one,
maybe two other people at the table
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just gets crowded and it gets
loud and I'd rather keep it peaceful and
[SPEAKER_00]: have less people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I do the perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit better and then it also
makes you feel like something's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of waiting 60 days for that damn
crop to finish, you can, oh it's cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't feel like it's so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the next crop is 60 days but
since I started one 40 days ago and then
[SPEAKER_00]: what's 40 minus 14?
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked myself picking a weird number
like that but since I picked one seven
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago and started it, then I'm gonna
have one in two weeks and then I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have one in two weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling because I took a lot of fat
dads and this, yeah, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you choose to run them all at one
time, you should have plants in that veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room ready to flower as soon as that room
is empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna have to keep a mother
plant and then four pots, four seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots for about eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll need clones for two weeks,
cups for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll need four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four clones, four cups, two weeks each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw those into the seven
gallon pots and let those go for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and then when you chop that other
room, you throw those plants in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to keep it going if
you wanna do it all at once or you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants every 30 days if that's easier
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd rather have a half a pound of
herb every 30 days, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this is completely adjustable,
this is just the best I could come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: since I don't know your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find it useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you put it to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you start pulling off somewhere
between three and five ounces for yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or your patients every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good supply of medicine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking more than that,
well, I can't judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke more than that, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even gonna try to judge you for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have hardcore Dab syndrome like
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
close to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taunting you and teasing you
about this perpetual grow episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see why it took me a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me 13 weeks to get to the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I went really quickly with all
of the stuff that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I skipped anything, please correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay so much more attention when I do a
30-minute episode, so I'm going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping up the show like a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks a lot for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back next Monday with a fresh

[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sounded like I was doing a paid ad,
and they did not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the shit that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my head feel a lot better after my
head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the clouds go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It obviously made me a little rambly,
but that's confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I did you a lot of good.
