[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 436 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu
Pure Kush Ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains 69.3%
THC and 82.1% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the flavor and aromas of the
Malibu Pure Kush, and I really like the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it just kind of chills me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my body feel real nice,
and I think it's great podcasting
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for the Malibu Pure Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I am going to read a listener email,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am also going to read some comments
from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, let's give a shout out
to a few of our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big old shout out
to Ms. Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big gigantic Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out to Matthew KW.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a shout out to Bafsta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big giant shout out to
Isaac Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to Squirrel Tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a big fist bump and Grow
From Your Heart podcast shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: new friend Killin' Kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all of you for the
continued Patreon support, and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to learn how to become a
Patreon you can do so by going to www
[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need should be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what else should we talk about
before we jump into this email?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually update you guys on my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been talking about my breeding
projects as much lately, but I recently
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested a large batch of feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people often ask me when will
there be more lemon jeffery seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me when I will have
more feminized golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is July 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will drop on July 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out my vendors on July
10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be available at seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be available at Oregon Elite
Seeds, and they should be available at
[SPEAKER_00]: dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also be available at the Dude
Grows 710 Concentration Celebration on
[SPEAKER_00]: July 13th at Cultivated Synergy at the
iRegenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to sound like too much of a
sales guy, but these seeds will go
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, so don't sleep on the new drop of
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will drop on 710 on the websites,
and they will be available on 713 at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows Concentration Celebration 710
event in Denver at Cultivated Synergy in
[SPEAKER_00]: very limited quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have the lemon jeffery feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have golden goat feminized seeds,
and I will have the brand new,
[SPEAKER_00]: never before released orangegasm seeds in
very limited quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come see me at the Dude Grows
Concentration Celebration on 713 at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy, or check out those
websites I mentioned before, seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com, Oregon Elite Seeds, and dankseed
.store on 710 for the fresh, feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also been getting a lot of requests
for detailed information about my feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and my nutrient recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before that I use Veg Bloom as
a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned that I add in some new
millennium products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I went on the Dude Grows show and
mentioned my mix, since I mentioned some
[SPEAKER_00]: of my mix on my podcast, I get at least
two or three emails every single day
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, I will do a fully
detailed episode on what I'm using for Veg
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom and new millennium and a couple of
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some very good ideas,
some very thorough information on my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix, and options for your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do episodes that are really in
depth like that, and I feel like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to cling to every word
and follow my advice very closely,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to make sure to give accurate
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode will take me a little bit
of time to put together, but it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: worth your wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the near future, you will get a
nutrient recipe episode that is mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on what I mix in a home grow and
in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, please keep in mind, I said it's
going to take me a little bit to create
[SPEAKER_00]: those episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to be very detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be patient, but I will make it
worth your wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's move into this email that I've
got sitting here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I did an episode about carbon
filters and carbon filter placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a great email from a listener who
wanted to add on some advice to that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely encourage and welcome
updated information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say something on the show and you
agree or disagree or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something to add on to it, please do reach
out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to correct me, if you'd like
to expand on my knowledge, please help me
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not afraid to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to expand my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill me up with knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener sent the email that goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ross DeJeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to the carbon filter episode
and I thought I would chime in with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in a location that requires
absolutely zero smell and they put zero in
[SPEAKER_00]: all capitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they mean zero smell, which in my
experience is pretty difficult to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if you're growing dank herb,
zero smell is difficult to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even veg plants put off a very distinct
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like growing vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you flip the flower,
you start putting off that dank aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it is pretty difficult to
achieve zero smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a carbon filter, we can minimize
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: With careful duct tape and careful
caulking, we can absolutely minimize
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has some great contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, even with a 24 inch carbon filter
for a six inch fan, I was catching a whiff
[SPEAKER_00]: of sweet dankness outside of my discharge
point, which happens to be outside for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: which now that means a lot of people have
access to that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got it near a part of the
house where you think no one's going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but you never know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a kid hits a baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bounces three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lands right there by that duct or that
van.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little kid runs over there to get the
baseball and he goes, damn, it smells dank
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little kids nowadays know what dank weed
smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes something simple and stupid
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So zero aroma is the goal for this
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is some of the advice that they
sent us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, one of the ways I corrected the
issue was to use rope caulk, easily found
[SPEAKER_00]: at any home improvement center,
to seal all of the joints in my duct work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I added another carbon filter at
the discharge point just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy's got air going in through a
carbon filter and also out through a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter at the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is double scrubbing the air and he
is also using rope caulk on every joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're typically going to have your
carbon filter and then your blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to caulk between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will have your blower and
probably some duct work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to caulk between the blower
and the ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever that ducting attaches,
you need to caulk that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more parts, caulk all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow light with glass
between the bulb and the canopy so that
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow light is sealed so you can move
air over and cool those lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably need to seal all of that up
with caulking as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If zero aroma is your goal, you cannot be
too careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put some type of sealant on every
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would wrap that again with duct
tape just to make sure if zero aroma is
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal, we want to go extreme and make
sure that zero aroma escapes this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I was talking about sealing up
the light, we need to be careful if we
[SPEAKER_00]: have got a ducted light hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to carefully seal that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got plants directly under that
light and you were blowing air over that
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a gap where air can get in or
out, that is a spot for aroma to
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially get sucked right into that and
blown right out of your grow space that
[SPEAKER_00]: did not get filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want any air that enters that tube,
that exit path to run through that filter
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beginning and have no chance of
entering the grow room or collecting more
[SPEAKER_00]: air through gaps on the way down that
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this listener also places another
carbon filter, which I'm sure he's using
[SPEAKER_00]: more sealant on that joint as well at the
very end at his exit point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you don't have another carbon
filter at that end, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a screen, at least a panty
hose or some type of thin cover just to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent anything from coming in your duct
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how high off the ground your
duct work is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how low your duct work is,
but I have seen weird shit happen with
[SPEAKER_00]: duct work that was not covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen birds fly into duct work that
was up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen snakes and reptiles climb into
duct work that was down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've walked into a grow room before that's
got sealed lights and there was a snake
[SPEAKER_00]: just chilling in the grow hood because it
was warm as fuck and that snake was loving
[SPEAKER_00]: life right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just climbed right down the ducting,
climbed into the light hood and just
[SPEAKER_00]: chilled out like, hey, this is beautiful
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a pain in the ass to get him
out because we had to undo all the ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some asshole had to reach in there
and get a snake out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put yourself in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a snake in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a reptile in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you seal the end of that
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, insects like to come up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel that warm air coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be nice in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the sun setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting colder outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, look, there's still sun in
there and they want to go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: find some food or maybe find something to
mate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go where the warm is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't invite them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are using one of those
portable air conditioners that has the
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting in and the ducting out,
cover the ducting on that with something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but make sure you use something that does
not restrict the airflow because you will
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin that air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be covered with something that
allows airflow but will not allow pests to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in or out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very thin screen, something with a very
fine micron mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use those HIPAA filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them in many different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut them to size and then you can
just use a staple gun to staple them right
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little duct tape over the edge so it
stops fraying, but make sure you cover all
[SPEAKER_00]: your ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need bugs coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need bugs climbing on our plants
and we certainly don't want some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: reptiles in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do, but if you do want a reptile
in there, you probably brought it in there
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it just showing up on
fucking surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to freak you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cover up your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is make sure to not let any
aroma escape that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on all of the stuff I talked about on
the previous episode, replace all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seals with some type of sealant or some
type of caulking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person recommends rope caulk and he
says you can get it at any hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a nice solid layer of rope
caulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would also cover it with duct tape
just because I've got some solid OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a little bit more to this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, personally, I like this set up
because if one filter starts to fail,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other will help to minimize the odor
until I can fix the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I like the mindfulness and I like
the forethought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have not experienced
any negatives to running two filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your blower is able to handle
it, that'll be a fucking good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says safe, discreet, and odorless
has no price tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra carbon filter, that stronger
blower is way more affordable than a
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyer, way more affordable than bail,
and way more affordable than having a
[SPEAKER_00]: felony on your record for the rest of your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buy that extra carbon filter and do the
extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message with made sure to
hug my mom on mom's day and then he signed
[SPEAKER_00]: it with the Milkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Milkman, thank you for the great
message and thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate updates and information
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if anybody out there would like
to send me an email, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love any sort of corrections,
updates, or contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more email in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get to the YouTube
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never read YouTube comments before on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start that on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, I can't thank you enough for
the incredible content and knowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: you share.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I learned something each
and every time that I listen to one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your shows and that is the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me feel good knowing that
I'm reaching my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I've recently started my
first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turned into a slightly controlled
disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's oftentimes how first grows go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, but finding your show and
documenting my grow gave me a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that I can take forward to make
the next one more successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the perfect attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learned how to fuck up a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can learn how not to fuck up a
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start somewhere, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the great attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I recently signed up for
the $4.20 level on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to shout me out,
use Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a legal country, but my work would
likely frown upon my grow interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's legal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Darren, I will keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, big shout out to my buddy,
Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the Patreon contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate hearing that I am helping
people out and that I improved your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: just by hearing my show and taking some of
the stuff that I rambled into a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were able to improve your garden,
which means your life is better,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means if you're smoking
recreationally or medicinally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were improving the quality of your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me feel good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always look forward to listening and
learning from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, thank you for the great message
once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again for the Patreon
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take way too many,
way too big, way too hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right after that, I'll come back and
read a couple of comments from my YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am heavily medicated, and it is time to
read some comments from the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm clicking that direction right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big thanks to everybody
who has subscribed to my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to YouTube, type in the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, you will find my
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please click subscribe, leave some
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will read your comments on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first comment on today's episode comes
from somebody who calls themselves Killer
[SPEAKER_00]: Bee's Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this comment six months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six days ago, the comment goes a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the man, RJ, and RJ stands for
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, you helped so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the same way in school, but the way
you teach is super engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's referring to is,
in an episode, I said that I hated school,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to find a way to entertain myself
while I was learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he agrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the same way, but the way that I
teach is super engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, thank you for all of
your efforts and a huge thank you for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the awesome genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're so welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those compliments mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the hard work, all the late nights
podcasting, all the frustration,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the research, all the writing,
all the time, all the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it worth it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I've popped many beans,
but all have been bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I finally got my hands on some legit
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, everyone is right when they say
genetics are the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I definitely can agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this grow, I'm on at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm glad you finally got some quality
genetics and I'm sure you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge difference in vigor and
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just knowing what you've got,
what you're working with will make the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow so much easier and so much more
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy the new genetics and I
hope those come out beautifully for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also hope to see photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some pictures of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got any questions,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Killer Bees, thank you for the great
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move on to the next
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by somebody who called
themselves Smoke Why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they want to be called Smokey
because I know why to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their comment goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing show once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your podcast on
Stitcher since 2015, maybe 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been there since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes, I don't remember what
year you started, but I've been listening
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been a big help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever have any questions,
please send them to my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going because there
are some great comments in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend, You Grow says, love the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get my seeds from Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thanks for supporting our
sponsor, Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse James said, I'd love to hear what
genetics you bring back from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is referring to one of our friends
who invited me to Europe to go hang out on
[SPEAKER_00]: a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I would love to see what kind of
genetics I brought back from Europe also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that happens, you'll be the second one
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another comment from Bill Parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, great podcast, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bill Parks, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one just says, arise, arise,
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one from Stony Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up to our friend Stony Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stony Scholar says, another great listen
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people listen while
they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I listen to the Dude Grow show
while I'm in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels right to be around the
plants and listening to a show focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Stony Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the DGC
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring some diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another great comment from our
friend Tristan Hawk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left a week ago and it says,
I wanted to drop in and say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks from a fellow new listener,
YouTube subscriber and say, I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: producing my own medicinal cannabis for 12
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to take it a step further by
getting my plant science degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, congratulations, dude, to have the
paperwork to jump on the legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: train for micro cultivation here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I hope that that's working out for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says one more year to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more year, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well informed and also well balanced
between botanical knowledge, yet making it
[SPEAKER_00]: simpler for new growers to comprehend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's been growing for 12 years and
he is getting a plant science degree and
[SPEAKER_00]: he is learning from this little podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am teaching people who are going to
school for plant science degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets me know that I'm really doing a
good service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good luck in school, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know school can be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not enjoy school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I love learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: School is just not the environment for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more great comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
just curious about your thoughts on using
[SPEAKER_00]: ascorbic acid to neutralize chloramine in
tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be effective in a small grow,
but now you have got ascorbic acid in your
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your pH is going to be a little
bit out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think RO filtration may be the best,
if not the only way to effectively get
[SPEAKER_00]: that out for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next comment was left by our friend
Kraft Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says another fantastic show Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay lifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Mel says thank you for the shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to hang out,
talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next one says, Yo Ross, you best stay
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking hilarious to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants a hug directly from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was left by our friend Mike
Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike Jones, when I see your mom,
I got a big old hug for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got more great comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, I've bought iri genetics
from Oregon Elite and Hela Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have good service, but Oregon Elite
has freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Hela Dank has freebies also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never said that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's catchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment is from somebody who
calls themselves the links grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says is bebop the same cross as blue
raspberry truffle?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop is a rise cross to blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male was the reverse blueberry cookies
and the seeds are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male was the arise and those seeds are
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that correctly because I
don't have any notes in front of me and I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to keep all that shit straight,
but I think you guys know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are opposites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comments keep coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this one says,
thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how you lay it all out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you noticed that I try to put as
much out there as I can without
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make it clear, but I don't want
it to be too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to try to find that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one says always the best advice
from Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the podcast, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them coming on point as always with
love from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to all my friends in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that recently I've gotten a
large following of people from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for following me up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any questions,
send them on to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love helping out my friends to the
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment is a compliment about the
helidank seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says just receive some of your genetics
from HDSC in two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fast, very friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to get these in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to hear that my sponsors
and my vendors are working correctly and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing things properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great compliment to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a comment here on the episode
I did about mushrooms in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you can take too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate about an ounce one night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that is too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be too many for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went into seizures and started vomiting
profusely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously lived and was fine, but the rest
of that night sucked dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds like a miserable
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from our friend AB.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice there, don't eat a goddamn ounce
of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a spiritual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go heroic.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ounce of mushrooms just sounds like a
bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment says good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Stony Scholar's name pop up in here
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Stony Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment says I love your show and
all of your shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I need to give a big shout
out to my buddy CJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, CJ?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you pop up in the YouTube comments a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just leaves a couple of emojis,
some flowers, some smiley faces,
[SPEAKER_00]: some thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CJ is a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Met him at the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking a little bit online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hang out, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are too like-minded to not become good
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I see James Butterson on here a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, James?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are always the first one to comment on
all of the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to James Butterson.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a comment from Buzz Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says thank you very much for taking the
time to answer my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to drop a line and let you know how
the dark period worked out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds plumped up and the trichomes
multiplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me that my advice
is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment is in reference to an
episode I did right around the time we
[SPEAKER_00]: lost my friend Brody Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this one was a trip to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big comedy fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much has gone down with all these
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Brody Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, big love to Brody and big shout out
to Blackbird for the great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to start wrapping it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says big growers love to Rasta
Jeff and all of my fellow Canaheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Craft Cannabis for the
great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of my fellow
Canaheads and big growers love to Craft
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
