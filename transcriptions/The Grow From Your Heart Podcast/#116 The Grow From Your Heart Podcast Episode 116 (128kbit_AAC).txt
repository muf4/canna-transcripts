today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting to my left is my new friend,
Danny Ono.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome you to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to the microphone for me,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to remind everyone to
talk into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's all red-eyed and dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a long day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go to Boulder last night or today?
[SPEAKER_10]: We went last night.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went to Boulder and Denver yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you new to Colorado?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just flew in from New York on
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_10]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you staying or are you just visiting?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just visiting right now, trying to make
some moves out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to make some moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'd be cool to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your company, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope you make it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting to his left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice how I had to fucking see
which direction that was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a fun show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting to his left is a repeat offender,
a return guest, our good friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Buzzi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe showed up and rolled a couple of
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lit them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we smoking in that joint right
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right here is a mystery kush
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is some unknown bag seed that was grown
and kind of smells lemony, cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystery lemon kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke that shit whenever you're
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming again, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting to his left, sort of to my
left-ish a little bit still, is my new
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagonal left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cesar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Cesar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to the microphone a little bit more
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, right up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: New reporter style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks good on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could do it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took a dab earlier and you said it was
going to wreck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not a heavy dabber?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just kind of smoke a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you from New York also?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that New York accent coming with
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't escape it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tired of hearing this Colorado
plane voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll enjoy something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you staying or are you just coming
to visit?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just coming to visit.
[SPEAKER_12]: On vacation, good times with better
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, better people, more relaxed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just vibe here than on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I spend usually 12 hours a day,
six days a week in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gets exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does weed cost in Manhattan?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like 50 for an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it any good?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's got to suck about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend that 50 and it's
either going to be, oh yeah, or it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be, oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get delivery service where you are?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I usually just go by my cousin's house
and make him do all the footwork.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to your cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say his name because he's a
criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to end up in a ditch or a
river for fucking saying your cousin's
[SPEAKER_00]: name on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: He revels in that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well man, thanks for coming on the show
while you're out here visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking some visit time to come
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting to his right, which is directly in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember I have two names in my head
I want to call you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say Audrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have went with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubted myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just moved out here with Chris when we
came across.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been here since like December 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were all over the place in
Colorado just kind of seeing everything
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we kind of like settled down in
Pueblo for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys actually landed in our friend
Sloppy's old house, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're sharing a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys sitting to her, that's your left,
but my right kind of is our friend Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: who is actually also known as Bobo
Blaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_07]: If people don't know that or Chris.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do the email tables and stuff,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Email tables, shelves, shelves,
all types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cases, Pelican cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have some weird other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like a little halo helmet set
coming out pretty soon too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple of little ideas that are
in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to make me a small email for
traveling purposes so that if I were to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in somebody's vehicle, maybe there could
be some time together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were just talking about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a car version that I'm
trying to do, a DC version.
[SPEAKER_00]: For camping, for when you're camping and
you're parked and you want to take a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: in the car that is parked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not while you're driving to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that would never happen to any of the
professional people in this room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a mic if you're going to shout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just keep reminding you guys,
these guys are new to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have enough mics for everybody,
so they're sharing mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it kind of radio station style
or whatever, like a board show style,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just grab a mic and slap the guy
next to you, steal his mic if you feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: urge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Kanye, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Kanye that bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got something to say, fuck your
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a fun show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took plenty of dabs before we got
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give you a big shout out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me the coolest dab table several
months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing on it on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take, I'm going to say 10 dabs off that
table every single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely looks like it got work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been put to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my Periscope friends have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that's watched any of my YouTube
videos have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still going, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sent that thing to me months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was warm when you sent it, because in
the Periscope video, I'm wearing shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was warm when you sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing is still rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say three months ago, four months
ago at 10 dabs a day, whatever kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: math that is, that's a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone looked at Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you compute?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The table has stood up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it burniture.bigcartel.com?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go there, check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell him that you heard about it on the,
or the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he will do something special for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll make sure you get hooked to the funk
up in the order.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can DM me if you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Custom orders and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you got ideas or thoughts or stuff you
might want to build, definitely DM me on
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram at Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or definitely send me a message at the
burniture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked you, I asked you what you could
make into an email for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your answer was it's more about what I
can't make into an email for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the funds and you think
you want it turned into an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can probably do it if you're patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Video game systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I wanted was a Nintendo,
an old Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_07]: N64.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I saw it done, so I didn't want
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's hard about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's doing it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an easy thing if you really know,
if you know, if you're an average
[SPEAKER_07]: electrician and you can kind of understand
some electrician, you can probably make
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a billion DIY, I mean,
DI.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we all took dads, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The do it yourself videos for days on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: All day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or on forums all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super stoned.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cover for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him dabs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him some shout out to Turpex and
the Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're doing shout outs, I do owe one
shout out to our good friends at Hitman
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm shopping for glass, I want to buy
something made in America, buy an
[SPEAKER_00]: American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm taking dabs out of the
Hitman short stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys were laughing at me because
there's like a gram and a half of reclaims
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what are you going to do
with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: One level of that stack is literally just
the wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: This level is where all the wax is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm trying to participate in the
Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be there this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Hitman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dougie, make sure you follow my friend,
Dougie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dougie on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you check out www
.hitmanglass.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they've got available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy glass from China, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rigs are made in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys dab as hard as you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them at trade shows,
they're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging out with this,
their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get shit made in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support the economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy glass made by a little kid with
no shoes and no protective eyewear,
[SPEAKER_00]: no glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little dude didn't get a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to fucking whip up against his ass all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possibly true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one dollar a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have a $20 mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump right into another
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said wait for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this on another episode,
but there's a whole new group of friends
[SPEAKER_00]: here that are actually more involved in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys seen the mothership rig that
sold for $101,000?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it that Sagan collab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that what you tagged me in Danny?
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing the other day?
[SPEAKER_10]: We were literally just talking about this
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful piece, but
outrageous, like crazy number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, I'm a huge Sagan fan boy,
so shout out to Sagan because he's just
[SPEAKER_07]: got it to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything he touches, I'm like,
yes, awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just outlandish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you won the Powerball.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say no more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I change it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make my own colors then?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, just like it is, if you won the
Powerball, would you throw it on $101,000
[SPEAKER_00]: on a glass rig still?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sagan would live in my basement and blow
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, please live with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you won a hundred, if you won that
billion dollars, you just tie Sagan up and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd be in the basement blowing a custom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been just high and stumbling around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stumble into me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, oh man, just being a high kid
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our listeners are right there with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not, take a dab right now so
that what Joe says makes sense.
Quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it, Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the auction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was that mothership event in like for
charity of any kind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it all because it was all like silent
auction style, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the charity was Scott Debbie's
fucking pocket is what I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: charity was for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did not know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that there was a charity
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way I could somehow justify
spending $100,000 on a glass piece is if
[SPEAKER_02]: you could somehow write it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it was involved with a charity,
that might be the way that they finagle
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I think it was at it was at
one of the trade shows that happened on
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either Vegas or the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mothership had a huge booth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of this is what I think what I
was told by somebody, instead of selling
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership rigs, they've learned that they
can make a lot more money by creating
[SPEAKER_00]: demand at these events because people are
hyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they got 101 instead of 100
is because two people were fighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: one dude said 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy said 100 and 101 got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure it's just you go to the
events and I've done it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought overpriced fucking rigs at
events because it's in front of me and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hyped and it sounds like a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of it being 1200, it's only
950 today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like I got a sweet ass deal
and you buy it and then you get home and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, oh fuck, I just bought this
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to pay rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all done something like that before,
but that's how you create the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude next to me holds up his new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is sponsored by Hitman glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about mothership right now,
but dude, this rig is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rig comes from illusions glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ill glass flux capacitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the right size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a quartz banger on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the mouthpiece on it and it's
sturdy enough for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice purchase, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got them on the fucking hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They marked it up, double what it should
be and sold it to you at half price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how thick the glass is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it's not made by some Chinese
kid with no protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made in Colorado at ill glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can all agree that that rig was a
little bit overpriced, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the, even the Sagan fan boy over here
is like, yeah, that was too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: A rig over like, say realistically $2,500
overpriced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I a hundred percent understand that
you're paying for the craftsmanship and
[SPEAKER_02]: the dedication that the person has put
into learning and perfecting an art form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you're really in the time
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, but I'm just trying to think of
a realistic number that isn't affected by
[SPEAKER_02]: market value or like the value the
market's putting on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on, I'm sure everybody in this
room makes a different paycheck and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of depends on each person will go,
no, that's too much for a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different people will be like,
yeah, I pay that for a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of depends on where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been times in my life where
I would have been like a hundred bucks for
[SPEAKER_00]: a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're, I'm like sitting here
hitting this hit man short stack that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all know is not a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just times have changed and people
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's all, it's all a,
what is it subjective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's over probably spending over a
thousand or 2000 bucks for a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass you could drop and break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this rig over here, this one is closer
to the four or five and it hits like a
[SPEAKER_00]: boss and it's a hash pipe still,
no matter how much you pay for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: how pretty it is, it's a hash pipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, like the only way I could feel like
I would justify even spending a reasonable
[SPEAKER_10]: amount of money is if you're buying it for
a sculpture like aspect of it,
[SPEAKER_10]: like a banjo piece, for instance,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we just went to the lazy lion,
like the banjo Joe P it's like more of an
[SPEAKER_10]: art piece than anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a sculpture.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's every little piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even that I don't even think is anywhere
near a hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are so many things I could buy a
car with, I could buy four cars with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I could buy a college education with
that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a week or two at college.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could realistically own a skyscraper
in Detroit with that much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could own fucking Detroit with that
much money right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you could buy a few blocks
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're going to move on from
bashing misery in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing incorrect about those
statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take those back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean nothing negative about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, why are rigs $25,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few, there's one, there's like
maybe an SD Rhino rig I'd pay good money
[SPEAKER_00]: for and probably a couple of coil pieces
that I pay good money for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you guys ever have that feeling
when you're like, I'm going to go buy
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to the store and you grab it
and you carry it up to the cash register
[SPEAKER_00]: and the lady tells you how much it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something inside you is like,
I just want to fucking put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have to take that much money out of
my pocket and give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was cool with it until like this
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost, I almost bought a mothership for
2,500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day before I drove to Denver to go
get it, I woke up and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to take all these hundred dollar
bills and give them to somebody right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just hold this and take a couple of
laps around the store and I'll just be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I held it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take some pictures and put it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like it was mine for a minute and you
can have it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So needless to say, I came to my senses
and did not purchase a $2,500 mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something that I can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the most expensive rig
on the table for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually sent to me by our
friends at Hitman glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, this will remain the priciest rig
on the table for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I don't want anybody to think that
I'm hating on these dudes who are making
[SPEAKER_02]: bank selling their glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's great that these guys can
support their families and their kids are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to college now because this dude
made art and it sold for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you approach it from, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was never, I was not approaching my
argument from the art standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was approaching it from the,
this is a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no matter how pretty it is,
which, so I talked about it on another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, but let's, uh, let's look at a
picture of it since we're, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all going to this other people that
listened to that episode might be
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this one and didn't hear that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to Instagram right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to pull up a picture and share
it with everybody so we can all see it
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched for a lot of stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to go hashtag mothership
and it'll come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you, can we agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we all agree that it looks like
something that maybe Tim Burton would have
[SPEAKER_00]: made or maybe if Les Claypool had become a
glassblower, maybe Les Claypool would have
[SPEAKER_00]: made this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of it here, but it's not
the picture I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Primus all day there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played yesterday in California and I
heard the show was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at this piece right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is got on the top of the mouthpiece
is supposed to be a moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it has got, I think that color is
called stardust, but it's got other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in it with this like metallic iridescent
glittery shit that just drives my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even focus on it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then it is, it's a Faberge egg
underneath that, but it's made with such a
[SPEAKER_00]: dark glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see through it to see the proper
shape of the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like a hand grenade to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys agree with that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gaudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like reflected stained glass on a
lake that's rippling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice, but I mean, it's so ugly at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership is known a hundred and one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that extra one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still got to pay taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothership is known for really like
smooth, sleek, tight glass with like no
[SPEAKER_00]: extra shit on it and really nice function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear, like a clear color, maybe like a
the piss yellow lemon drop or the pink or
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Azure blue is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing is just gaudy and overdone.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, this little moon down here,
they sent that to the moon, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to space in a weather balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, he did a whole set of pendies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got these moons around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a bunch of moons attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's supposed to be the actual
phases of the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd spin it around, it goes through
the moon phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they made a cheap bong and
glued a bunch of fucking moons onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to buy it and glue a little rocket
ship to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to quit bashing this mothership
rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being rude now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there goes Ross and Jeff's custom
Irene genetics mothership not coming in
[SPEAKER_07]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can send me one of the race car
series any day of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blue race car is dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if there's a green race car series,
I got cash in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody bought the red one up right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's so gorgeous, but that race car
series, I will take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anything that's not a fixie for
mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, what I want to say is the reason that
cosmic peace gets away with it is because
[SPEAKER_02]: it is a collab because it's not a straight
up mothership piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mothership base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then an artist went to town on it,
went the fuck to town on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will probably never get smoked
out of, no, they were dabbing out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hours after they bought it,
there are pictures on Instagram of these
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes dabbing out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't, you're just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a hundred grand on a rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like how often are you really going to use
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would spend that much money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to use it every single day just to
be like, this is worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be afraid to fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hand would be on it while you dab out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head would be on it while you dab out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, no, I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, you work, you stick your head in
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a padded room you go into to take
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you guys check out this rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd go to a mothership glass on
Instagram, you'll see what we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is redonkulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also here's something I've been seeing
on, uh, social media sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys seen the super clear hash
that somebody made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clear as glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: In which, in which state are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not, not United States, like which,
which phase is the hash in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're holding it in their hand with a
rubber glove and behind them is an across
[SPEAKER_00]: international vac oven and they just hold
it in front of the camera and took the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture and there was no caption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the picture went up and stayed up for
like three or four days and people went
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts over this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was as clear as this rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys didn't see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, can I see this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, I'm just going to ruin all your
guys is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just straight up a piece of ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since they wore a rubber glove and
took a picture of it in front of a vac
[SPEAKER_00]: oven and didn't post anything,
everybody's mind just went, look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: clear hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody just jerked off and had a
fucking orgasm to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of my friends, I'm, I'm a lot of
people's cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm their weed guy and people were sending
me the picture all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is this real?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this real?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally I messaged them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where can you find this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much a gram?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I messaged them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what is that exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like ice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, it's ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no comment or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just posted the picture and they just
let everybody assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's minds went right to,
Oh my God, look at this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they saw rubber gloves in a vac of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, you know, if you see
lotion and a Kleenex in your buddy's
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom, you think he's jerking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's if you got fucking vac of it and
rubber gloves, you're making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl in the room almost spit her water
on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just now the only female in the room
almost lost her shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about that on the show
yesterday, but you guys are more in the
[SPEAKER_00]: loop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys over here yesterday, uh,
our local dudes that aren't, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: is hip into the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you guys just moved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got a brand new house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are spoiled because you moved
into sloppy's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that may have already been equipped
for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had chosen to grow in there,
a lot of people that are going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: here aren't going to have that advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few minutes left in the show
that we could keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for a few minutes, let's talk about
things that if people were going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: to a house in Colorado and you plan to
grow, what are some things you should look
[SPEAKER_00]: at when you're looking for a house before
you move in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like have this in mind before I move here,
look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at houses,
if you plan to grow there, like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing just to get it rolling, like make
sure you've got enough electricity coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the power is really limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get an older house, uh,
you may have like a 50 or an 80 amp,
[SPEAKER_00]: a maximum in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house, we could pull 200 amps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, I'm in a nice, big, fancy
residential area, but some homes you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: pull enough power to run more than two or
three or three or four lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely check out the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to have an electrician
come, uh, here's a good segue into the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's something to really think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just rolled your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a fucking experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not with growing, but like, yeah,
just landlords in general.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if that dickhead landlord is at
your front door and you've got to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: the basement, he wants to come in and do
something and there's no keeping him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make sure you got a good
landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, fortunately my landlord lives in
Michigan, so they have been here once
[SPEAKER_00]: since I moved in in the past, like eight
years and they drive by when they came to
[SPEAKER_00]: visit their family and they're like,
the front yard looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much what I got from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find a landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find one of those rental
agencies that they rent you the house and
[SPEAKER_00]: they forget about you, as long as you send
that check every month, if you can find a
[SPEAKER_02]: place like that, those are rare in
Colorado because they're, because they are
[SPEAKER_02]: aware of what people are renting houses to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you really want to find like a local
landlord.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are planning to grow, it's very
easy to grow legally here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to grow illegally when
it's so easy to have all your paperwork in
[SPEAKER_02]: order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then, and, uh, oh, I forgot where
I was going with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a good, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, uh, other things for your grow
room too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, what are you doing for your
ventilation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your landlord cool with you modifying
the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to cut some ducting holes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You environment is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about how many rooms does the house
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to have enough room to
adequately grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't have crazy expectations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not your two closets and your one little
room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of a sudden you have three
bedrooms filled.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how growing goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move to Colorado, you hang one light
and you're like, look, I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, well, now I need a bedroom
and a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, now I need veg,
flower, clones, and mugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, no, I'm going to breathe in
this other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where do I sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go in another house with
another landlord and doing it all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit happens in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Joe said, have a good roommate or
have a good landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get any fucking roommates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll pay the other bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get any roommates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll, that'll screw everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angry roommates are one of the,
no offense, but angry girlfriends and
[SPEAKER_00]: angry roommates are one of the leading
causes of garden failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And angry partners don't have another
partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it yourself, get your own house,
set that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, make sure there is access
to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get plenty of water to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need, I say probably about
five gallons of water per light every
[SPEAKER_00]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's every thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need about five gallons of water
every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too hot, you're going to have to
get more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a place that you can control the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of basements get really,
really cold and dank in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think this is going to be
awesome, but that coldness will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That drastic change from hot to cold is a
huge, huge cause of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't know what to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fuck up the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of the basements around here,
the basements are just dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not want to grow in any basement
around here until you kind of frame it out
[SPEAKER_00]: or build something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look and see how dirty, how dusty,
how funky the place is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not going to have any
busting pipes in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying basements,
but basements are the best place for a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperatures are easier to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more easy to keep private.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure it's not real dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got somewhere for the
water to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure maybe you've got a floor drain
or a way to get rid of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got an old bathroom
shower, an old shower down in the basement
[SPEAKER_00]: or an old toilet down there, make sure you
just have somewhere to dispose of water
[SPEAKER_00]: because there will be water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your neighbors aren't right on
top of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbors are a few feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were any closer, I would be
uncomfortable having any blowers coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of any windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure your neighbors are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't live next to any cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be rule number one,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tip number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just bust it out right in front of the
cop's house and he'll never fucking notice
[SPEAKER_00]: because he'll be like, why would that
asshole grow there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you move in, don't go carrying in
your grow lights and your hydro setup all
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of wait for the... If you can drive
the car into the garage and unload there,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show up with seven lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cardboard sign that says we grow
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fluorescent light and the guy spinning
a sign outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Trap House.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just see it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he's fucking dancing and
spinning a sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trap House.
[SPEAKER_01]: We throw raves on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_01]: $20 grams.
$20 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting high over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need somewhere to get rid of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some way to feel secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy a house that's got old ass
doors, old ass doorknobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to get away with the grow in
the hood, but it's also easier to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow fucking stolen in the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a kind of a boundary you have
to work with there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are right on that cusp in your
new house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, it's hood enough,
but it's a little hood.
[SPEAKER_07]: All our neighbors seem pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had any issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all are happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Slop was there before us,
so that's- Slop regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slop came in and laid down the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Sloppy for not taking any
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slop, I owe you a hug, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy, give me some grateful debt
tickets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret, secret fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually a little, there's a little
beef going on with you guys that you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: even know about.
Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can't be beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come give you a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fucking put on my shoes and drive
over there after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I should not because it's
late, but I'm going to do that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want no beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been to your new house yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me some grateful debt tickets,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that ninja's got to keep in mind,
I worked 50 miles.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he works a lot, but bruh,
you can't sleep for 10 minutes and just
[SPEAKER_06]: dab me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining, but I haven't had a
day off in over 32 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I counted was 32 days to my
last day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day 36, when I get that day off,
I'm going to come give you a hug and a
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss on the cheek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll play with that big old fucking Afro
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just commenting on it last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so round and perfect now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, it's got to be something really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeners, call to action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like you to name my friend
Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up on the Grow From Your Heart
podcast Twitter page at GFYH podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a Twitter, but I might get
one just for that.
Defroto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defroto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's named Frodo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's fucking name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contest over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contest over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winner to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won a flux capacitor rig from Ill
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won half off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only marked it up triple price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not pass on just for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've made it listening this far,
I fucking love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot, a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me it would be really funny
if I said, Hey Siri, Google Golden Goat on
[SPEAKER_00]: my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people have an app on
their phone called Siri.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you say, Hey Siri, it activates it,
makes it start working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now people's phones are randomly
Googling Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I fucked up your phone, that's really
funny to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I fucked up your phone, I'm laughing
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got Hey Siri turned on,
that was your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: My phone didn't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, I'm going to put together an
episode all about getting your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure we did a short episode
about that, but two, maybe three people
[SPEAKER_00]: have asked me to do an episode all about
getting your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to the mama that worked on
my dreadlocks for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is one of the people that said I
should do an episode about getting her
[SPEAKER_00]: badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a manager at a shop and a lot of
people come in without badges and ask her
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if she had a podcast to refer them to
it, help her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to make that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for working on my dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get that episode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dreads look sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we should shout out everybody's
Twitter pages or Instagram or some way to
[SPEAKER_00]: find all these weird fuckers that you guys
were just listening to a bunch of good
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we'll start over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you had an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's creative.
[SPEAKER_09]: K R E A T I V E underscore chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: K A O S that is creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Joe Buzzy, do you have any way that
you'd like people to follow you or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to remain an anonymous over
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really tried, you got anything you
want to share with us, Caesar,
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I, I really don't do anything
exciting.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to follow, you want to follow
me, uh, building my Jeep at a Shavo 45 18
[SPEAKER_12]: C H A B O four five one eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone will check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find the girl of your dreams
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just creeping on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might be checking you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that would be nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you into?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm trying to date you, what are you
into?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to work on your Jeep and then
we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to the boardwalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunsets.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on, see Italian restaurant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sunsets.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sunsets and big tits walks.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a sucker for upset big tits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big tits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they get everything jumbled up
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're looking for a girl that
likes Italian food, got big boobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go on the sunset, ride in the
Jeep, smoke some good dough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Manhattan area, I mean,
you're a fucking driver.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go anywhere around and try state.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's one most powerful thing
out here in the world and that is pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wondered for a minute, I was like,
am I going to take that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm fucking not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think the man is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking time out of your day to
be on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you young lady?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the traveling stoner on Instagram and
all other social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: All other social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you traveling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a stoner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure you're not
fucking around, not faking the funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're the one that I'm talking to a
lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that was going to come up once I
said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty sure that was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I can finally tell you that it was
the reason I even got a periscope was
[SPEAKER_01]: because my favorite thing is when he would
jump into your periscopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you say Bobo Blasterco used to
make me giggle so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and got a periscope so I could hear
you say the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you would have been there the first
time I giggled so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was so excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's the delay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're like, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: The traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making people giggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys follow me on periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do as many videos as I used to
because I'm fucking working a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sloppy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, babe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just busy, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still got a bromance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still my Tuesday bitch,
sob.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you check out the traveling
stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out the traveling
stoner follower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure she posts some good pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might look one day.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now my friend over here, Mr. Bobo
Blasterco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of stuff to plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the burniture stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can people find burniture?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The easiest way to find burniture is
burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can hit me up on Instagram at Bobo
Blasterco.
[SPEAKER_00]: She giggled right in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully endorse his product, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot to get me to endorse your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only brands I really represent right
now are Highly Educated Titanium,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil Slick, Hitman Glass, Turpex,
of course, Team Green and Healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Bobo Blasterco, the burniture,
because that shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm happy because I was hoping that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expecting you to come back with
like, all right, I give you like a six,
[SPEAKER_07]: a five, and I was like, all right,
I got to go back to the drawing table,
[SPEAKER_07]: fix out a little tweaks and send you a new
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, all right, test this one now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green button gets warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like my only complaint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only... I mean, it doesn't...
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my only issue when I've already
fixed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I've said... That's why I can't
wait to refurbish that one back to brand
[SPEAKER_07]: new for you.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add two more at the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be way too crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd get hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the table, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, check out the tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy your table, if there's a
comment section on Big Cartel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what the shopping cart looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a comment section, make sure
you type in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about this through Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross DeGeoff told me something grew from
your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him know so that we can high five each
other and he knows where the sales are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, where the business has
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always nice for us to know that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does anybody have any sort of important
message you'd like to relay to the world
[SPEAKER_00]: before I start closing up the show here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My message for the day is don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good enough, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give each other a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgive somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a new start.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up the show.

[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's going to come out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, he's going to come move out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: There's two states that I've come to visit
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to get C to come move out
