[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,

[SPEAKER_02]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, my friends call me roster

[SPEAKER_02]: for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you

[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh guys, I apologize for the clogged up
throat there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to blame that one on everybody
here at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a newcomer to the podcast sitting
in front of me is my new friend Shannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you for bringing the dabbing
granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dabbing granny is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She drove me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to clear my throat and get this
podcast started, but oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_02]: when granny shows up, we take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when you come here?
[SPEAKER_02]: We get high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also shout out to the Barefoot Grower for
helping us out to get high as fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I met him for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to run before the show started,
but thanks for dropping by tonight,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, repeat offenders are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She tried to mimic the whole entire intro,
but she couldn't quite do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's recovered from a dab that she nearly
died from a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, the traveling stoner
is back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay after that dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm totally good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really am.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a bottle of water?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I totally have one over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm totally good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 10 minutes ago, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm feeling better now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, ladies and gentlemen,
someone who's not on the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: he comes here often.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of quiet, but the infamous Mr.
Bobo Blastrico is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Bobo Blastrico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent but deadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for teaming up with me and making
me not the only dude here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting outnumbered.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I came here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want the odds to be that heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I could have handled it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about suppositories.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Granny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three ladies that have already medicated
by sticking a suppository up their
[SPEAKER_02]: rectums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to turn that down the
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get right to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, ladies and gentlemen,
at separate times, don't be dirty,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at separate times this evening,
these three ladies stepped into my lovely
[SPEAKER_02]: pink restroom and nobody made fun of me
for my pink restroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is super pink in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they inserted and or applied some
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have my notes out where I can see
them, but I have it all in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since Shannon is the newcomer and also the
provider of the suppositories,
[SPEAKER_02]: though not you personally, your company,
we're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about the company and
tell us about suppositories and then tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me about the dosage that everybody was
just fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Shannon, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Connoisseurs Genetics and
Concentrates is the name of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are solventless company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got rosin products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of our main products,
but we also carry the ancillary products,
[SPEAKER_00]: bath bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have seen them around town.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've become very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our suppositories are just kind of
that silent medication that nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, but is so highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the new levels of chemicals that
are allowed in solvents or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, it's just a smarter,
I mean, if you're applying this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you need it for medical reasons,
you don't necessarily want those chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's just a much better application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people who want to be medicated
during the day, but can't afford to be
[SPEAKER_00]: high due to their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not get you high per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a euphoric feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that when you can manage
something, symptoms that have been killing
[SPEAKER_00]: you, it's just nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a euphoric feeling when that relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not use a suppository tonight,
but I have tried one, and euphoric is
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly one of the words I would use to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of my lower back pain was noticeable
after using a suppository.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it definitely works for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the 70% absorption rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, edibles is 30, smoking is
approximately 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's the most effective way to get
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys probably put them in,
say 30 minutes ago-ish?
[SPEAKER_02]: About that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How well are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: I cheated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny cheated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Granny, you're always going a little
hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear what you did.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put one in at home, and I put one in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she doubled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one for the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that means Dad and Granny is actually
medicated with 100 THC, and 100 CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Lindsay, since we've only done one,
it's a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 THC, 50 CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we do cater to medical
patients, I recently helped a colon cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: patient that's stage four, and made
200-200 because that's what his
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just the most effective way
for him to get that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working for him?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just delivered those today specifically
for that patient while I was down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope those work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming all the way down to
Pueblo also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are Colorado Springs dwellers.
Springs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're down here in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hasn't been the desert lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how many you got for 200 milligrams in
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did it take for the first one to
kick in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 30 to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsay, do you notice a difference since
you don't go as frequently?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: It definitely kicks in somewhere in the 30
to 40 minute range.
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually probably just kicked in about
10 minutes ago for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really was like, why can't I feel my
legs?
That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also took a dab that made you cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably got your blood pressure
moving.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this was actually before the dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually, I looked down like right
before the dab and I was like,
[SPEAKER_11]: why the hell?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a wash over feeling that you
get, that it just kind of washes over you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I explained it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I explained it that it starts sort of in
your tummy and then it sort of just
[SPEAKER_02]: spreads out and you can feel the medicine
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never got above my chest region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never felt any medication above that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some shoulder pain from a car
accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never felt it there, but my knee pain
was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: My legs were, I don't know that I would
want to take it the first two times and
[SPEAKER_02]: try to go to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: My job involves me on my feet working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running laps basically all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that my legs would have
cooperated a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might've been a little too much for a
day's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we first created these
suppositories, I was making 15 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: and 25 milligram as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it just got to the point where
if you're in that much pain that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to stick something up your rear,
it's going to need to be seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not doing it just for 15
milligrams, but for 50, I'll go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be the threshold is 50 is
where everybody's comfortable jumping in
[SPEAKER_00]: that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see, what is your demographic
that's using your product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see an apprehension from males?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they afraid of using your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get apprehension when, like if I'm
giving out samples and I give out one to
[SPEAKER_00]: one person, they're apprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I give two people, they will
usually team up and be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it if you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gender specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it kind of goes across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the only thing we've focused on
is the symptoms of helping with pain
[SPEAKER_00]: management or just the relief of that
sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for women, there's an alternate use as
well that's not highly talked about and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes men cringe, is that monthly mistress
that comes and visits, it can be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have endometriosis or other
things and men look at us and they know
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've seen their girlfriends
wrenching pain, but they don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like girls actually, if you say that,
they're like, it relieves that and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are willing to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure Lindsay can attest to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know she suffers from that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I actually, I have ovarian cysts,
which is why I even have a medical card.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've suffered from it since I was
about 16 years old and I truly didn't have
[SPEAKER_11]: full relief from my pain until I moved to
Colorado and I had tried CBD for the first
[SPEAKER_11]: time, even just dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I couldn't believe how much that had
taken away from me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the first time I ever took a
suppository, I was in a lot of pain and
[SPEAKER_11]: Gayle had given me one of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, Gumby, you could barely
move my bottom legs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I was just like so stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say your bottom legs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_11]: No one else caught it, did you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody else caught it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: My bottom legs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, my bottom half is what I meant to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcast listeners might be envisioning
you as a minotaur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what is this lady?
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, now I gotta go see her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her bottom legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what her upper legs are looking
like.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Lindsay, would you say that the
medicated feeling kind of comes in waves?
[SPEAKER_09]: You might think, okay, oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's peaked, but no, you get a good 10
hours, sometimes 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like the medicine knows where
to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for shoulder and neck pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of, once it goes past the heart is
that's kind of like, you would have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would have to be applied differently
because the heart's kind of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's running these blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the edibles get to my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I eat it, it goes to my head and
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I boost it, it goes to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said that cannabis knows where to go
on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our receptors are like, help me,
help me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It finds the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tickles the pain and massages that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if there's leftovers,
it goes to your brain and makes you a
[SPEAKER_02]: little high is the way I feel cannabis
does.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you consume like we do, it goes
right to your brain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it goes to the other places.
[SPEAKER_09]: It knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Lindsay texted me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was trying to hang out with
Lindsay one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you want to hang out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, ah, I hurt so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, did you put one of those
suppositories in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I actually recommended it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'd sound crazy, but go ahead
and try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, been there, done that
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, don't think I didn't think of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was two hours ago, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess in a sense,
you can say it gets you high, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the mental psychosis, anxiety that there's
nothing mental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything above the shoulders is basically
not touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: My feet aren't touching the ground
properly kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My socks were too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to get the tingles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shannon, one thing we do need to say to
the ladies, since you brought it up about
[SPEAKER_09]: monthly cycles, I recommend it all the
time, but we need to let them know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't do this vaginally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can, but if you think about it,
your monthly cycle is to flush things out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you're going to insert that
suppository into your vagina, you're going
[SPEAKER_09]: to flush the medicine back out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to say pre-medicate, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't putting it in your butt do the
same thing, basically?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get it there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have more membranes in your butt,
so you might as well go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was a lady and they wasn't
our suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any heart in it,
but I do know that she had had bladder
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer or something more on the female
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, she used them vaginally and the cysts
were going away with chemo on the outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they weren't going away on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, by using the suppositories,
she was able to reduce the ulcers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_09]: But she wasn't on her cycle when she was
inserting them.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might not even have had one anymore,
depending on age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we probably have all agreed,
don't use it vaginally when you were on
[SPEAKER_02]: your period.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do have an ovarian cyst,
maybe put it in there if you're seeking
[SPEAKER_02]: relief and not on your cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, to be honest with you- And on your
period, put it in your butt to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: pain relief.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of agree with- Jesus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of agree with Gail here.
[SPEAKER_11]: To be honest with you, I've only ever
really put one in my vagina one or two
[SPEAKER_11]: times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every other time that I've used them,
which has been about a dozen now,
[SPEAKER_11]: has all been in my butt because- Oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of reasons- You know I'm
going to cut that into a sound,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: About a dozen times in my butt.
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that because you just showed me
those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, are you really?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure he's got a spoof in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, honestly, I hope so because that's
going to be an awesome ass- We can auto
[SPEAKER_12]: tune that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, make a beat out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_13]: About 12 times in my butt.
[SPEAKER_12]: Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to just derail this whole show.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's cool because- Back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sell it to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can rap over it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sloppy, I hope you're listening to this,
my dude, because we're going to film it at
[SPEAKER_12]: Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Camille gets work to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my family.
[SPEAKER_12]: Squad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my weed family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great family.
We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get- Because the suppository
figure that's on here is just a black
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Halloween, they have those full black
bodysuit things that are just- We can
[SPEAKER_00]: totally be suppository dudes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Suppository dudes doesn't- Shannon,
maybe we should tell them about the size
[SPEAKER_09]: of the suppositories just because they do
cringe.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say that to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that I really wanted
before I forget, because I'm really
[SPEAKER_11]: stoned, I like to throw them in the
freezer for about five to 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_11]: before I use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way, because I'm an idiot and I
leave them in my- When I first get them,
[SPEAKER_11]: I leave them in my bag or somewhere and
they kind of not melt, but they just get a
[SPEAKER_11]: little soft.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like our concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just get a little bit soft.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't want to have any issues,
any crumble, any breakage.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I throw it in the freezer just so it
hardens up just that tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's super easy to answer and
there's no issues with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're looking for a super easy way
to do it, that is my tip for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I- I typically store mine in
the refrigerator or the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep them in the freezer once they cure
and everything and I seal them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a cooler temperature,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we don't, and if you check
any YouTubes or any of those type of
[SPEAKER_00]: forums, they will all say, use coconut
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't use coconut oil because
there's a lot of people who have allergies
[SPEAKER_00]: to it that have developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually use cocoa butter and beeswax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why ours are a little,
they stay firmer even when they're not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of the others I know because
when they're made out of coconut oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the second you touch it, it starts to melt
regardless of how you've stored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I try to be conscious of all
common allergies and things that may
[SPEAKER_00]: affect patients, especially when their
immune system is already being
[SPEAKER_00]: compromised.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you make them out of solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you teach our listeners that may not
know what solventless hash is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give them a quick lesson?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you need a hand, we'll jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually kind of have this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what kind of concentrate
we're making, we makes everything is done
[SPEAKER_00]: with either heat and pressure or ice and
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use any chemicals throughout the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're solvent free, which means
there were solvents used, but they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, we never this product never
touches a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in our grow, it's as close to organic
as you can get, you know, to get certified
[SPEAKER_00]: organic cost a lot of money and we're
still new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in our coming days or years
probably when we can truly go full
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the process, things are removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's star melt, say we make it into
hash with ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a hash guy that makes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we press that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the truthful melt and we get our
different microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, if it's not,
doesn't meet our standards of truthful
[SPEAKER_00]: melt, then we press it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just is, you know, that it's a
95% typically THC level about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we always have the testing
on those and it varies a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our nug melt, we just take the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about how you cure it,
how it's grown, the strains you use are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just take it and it's processed
down and we just press the flour with heat
[SPEAKER_00]: and pressure, which makes a rosin as well,
which is becoming more and more popular.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my listeners might not know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give them just a,
it's basically you're taking a really high
[SPEAKER_02]: tech George Foreman grill and squishing a
bud into a George Foreman grill and some
[SPEAKER_02]: juice strips out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that juice is very potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a huge fan of rosin smoking by
itself because I usually don't like the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's done, if it's made, if you take
hash and make rosin out of hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: that tastes good, but I don't think
squishing the bud makes flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are huge fans of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to hate me for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, but it's not, it tastes like,
it all tastes like burnt popcorn or a
[SPEAKER_02]: popsicle stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and that's where the differentiation
is with nug melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's not being done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not being done right, which means
it's being exposed either too long to the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat or too high of a temperature for too
long, you get that popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to say it's never
happened in our kitchen, but if that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens, those could turn into ancillary
products, bath bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we'd, that's not something that we
would put on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we would say,
smoke this because it doesn't taste right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've really worked on
perfecting the cure and the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we press it, the time and it's a
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's something that we've been
really working on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I believe there was, I think we had
some nug melt here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure that you actually get to
try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll prove your popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not done right, that's exactly
what it tastes like.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sounds like you guys have
mastered the tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're taking properly done rosin and
then making that into a liquid that's able
[SPEAKER_02]: to be put into the suppositories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I have a formulation and I know what
calculations to make as far as,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to make potencies and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on how many I'm making,
it's just, it's formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just take the rosin and the CBDs and
just melt it down within the cocoa butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, your ratios, proprietary
mixtures and such.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had said something about size,
Gale, and you know, size is, if I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the end of your pinky,
that's going to vary because everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: pinky is a different size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two, it's two grams is what
it weighs out in, in amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a liquid and maybe a half an inch,
half an inch, you know, it's, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they're the same size as a fleet
suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you've ever used any type of
suppository, it's the exact same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're buying the same molds from the same
companies that the major players buy from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody out there is going to argue with
us and say that water is a salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we know water is a solvent,
but it's not being used as a, we get that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's being used more as an agitator in
this situation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not a harmful solvent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still people are haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to leave them a
footnote.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is a solvent in this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, the ice is being used as more
like a beater to break off the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't, don't get at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know someone's going to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, and it's RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's of course, the water is
technically a solvent.
[SPEAKER_11]: But isn't it solventless in the fact that
like the water isn't changing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The properties of it, whereas like when
BHO and PHO has run through it,
[SPEAKER_11]: it physically changes it and chemically
changes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on how big of an internet troll
you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm telling everybody to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: That ends it right there because water
doesn't change the chemical properties of
[SPEAKER_11]: it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just text it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He will say, he will say it is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's the one that tells us that water
is not a solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that's always got to give
that speech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he created the hashtag solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put it back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the size of
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's talk about, uh, my favorite word
insertion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, a lot of dudes, a lot of people
looking at me like really gonna put that
[SPEAKER_02]: in your butt, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like they said, you're not putting,
you guys, you eat all day, you take giant
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this little thing's not going to affect
your butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's smaller than any poop you've
ever thrown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_09]: But right there, Jeff, is what you men
say.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that hole is meant for stuff to come
out, not stuff to go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first when you say suppository,
that's what my natural reaction is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I think I'm a logical dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: How high are we going to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's not so it just, literally he just
put it in your butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you go like, like about a
knuckle, maybe a knuckle and a half.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're that frightened,
put a little, lubricant, just like you
[SPEAKER_09]: were having sex.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's already a lubricant and it's
cocoa butter.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you, Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the story over here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what I missed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was jokingly spitting in my hand as you
turned to me and I was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were just exchanging glances.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends at work were like, how do you,
how do you know how, when it's in right
[SPEAKER_02]: now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you push too far, your body
pushes it down a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you don't go far enough,
it falls out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called that second sphincter muscle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jeff, it just comfortably right
in one spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of, kind of, you'll know it's there,
but it didn't only last a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes, like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is going to sound crazy,
but I mean, I guess whatever, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, as long as you get it completely in,
you can kind of like squeeze your butt
[SPEAKER_11]: cheeks and push it the rest of the way
without needing to get knuckle deep.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll kind of put itself where it needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're really that squeamish about your
butt hole, you can just like get it all
[SPEAKER_11]: the way in there physically.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can just use your own butt
cheeks to just squeeze it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then wash your hands before you come
take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me disclose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important since you are possibly
inserting your finger, you do want to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands before you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me just say that because there'll
be those, it'll be like, Oh, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to wash my hands before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not all savages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wash your hands, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to bring up another thing that
maybe people are squeamish to talk about,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I do get asked this.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about leakage?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I'm glad you said that because that's
exactly what I was going to say earlier
[SPEAKER_11]: when we got derailed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, guys, we are truly talking
medicating here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of the subjects might be,
and if you're 15 years old and don't
[SPEAKER_09]: listen to us, this is, we are truly
talking about medicating here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not all going to be suppository
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to talk more stuff also.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to sound crazy, but like,
I mean, like I don't put them in vaginally
[SPEAKER_11]: because I am always afraid that like,
I'm going to take a dab afterwards and
[SPEAKER_11]: cough really hard or like, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like do, and like two soundbites in
one show.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many soundbites can we rack up in a
podcast?
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's, I mean, it's not like a
super big, like fear of mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I mean, like, don't be children.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's going to just fall out
of my vagina.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I have like, anyways,
three, three soundbites.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I actually don't use them
that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I'm super afraid of like,
sneezing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys can't see the tears coming out of
everybody's faces on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all best friends now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finally coming back around from the
dabs that I had earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will came over and he's like, try this
Skywalker hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave me like at least a half gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I was taking, I was like,
well, there goes the podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shannon and I were the first ones here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I looked at Will and Jeff and I was
like, what's wrong with these two?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they tired or something?
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked at Jeff and I was like,
you look tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just kind of high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm dabbed out for a minute.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Dr. Pepper and good friends
and laughter for bringing me back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab in a minute.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab in a second and
fix myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_11]: We never really finished about leakage.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, please start that rumor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've never personally experienced
leakage with the anal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_02]: With either one of them, but- But it's
possible because it's a liquid product and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's- If you don't go far enough,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're timid and you don't and
it's hanging on the edge, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably going to have a little
leakage.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's going to be some melt agents.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out in your underwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be basically wasting
the medicine and it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing if it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if that happens, like it's not the end
of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wash your clothes, wash your
underwear and- Go to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_02]: get another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push a little further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in reality, there should not be any
leakage.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to have any- I know potato
chips that have given me worse side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects than I've had from the knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chipotle has done worse things.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I really couldn't say that there's any
super negative side effects that stand out
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So- Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a random question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody gets ahold of these and they
don't have the proper labeling and they
[SPEAKER_02]: eat one, what's going to go wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically 50 milligrams THC and
50 milligrams CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be processed through your
liver and stomach.
I was just going to ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you are probably going to get a head
high and not feel a lot of pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a different high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cocoa butter and it's beeswax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's- Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do ask that you be responsible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be responsible medicators and keep these
products away from your children and your
[SPEAKER_11]: pets.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of- I was going to ask,
could we use these for our pets?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was like, I don't even want to
journey down that road right now after the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation we just had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm going to go with another question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to insert it in my dogs?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come here, Fido.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that go back to the horse thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these young ladies had a conversation
about a documentary where people were
[SPEAKER_02]: having sex with their farm animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not bring it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't start it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ladies did this to us here earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was going to ask really though was
what type of conditions would you
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you had just a list of conditions
and if you're like suppositories,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll fix that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you go for first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain and any kind of, you know,
symptoms that you have where you need that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say nerve ending I'm going to say
anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I use my own personal experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it, granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the best ways to describe
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a year and I weaned my husband off
opioids with the help of these
[SPEAKER_09]: suppositories.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: With CBDs and suppositories, Kevin is now
opioid free.
[SPEAKER_09]: Congrats, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was stubborn about cannabis,
wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_09]: He will smoke, but he didn't want to do
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't want to do CBDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll smoke his bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the beginning of 2016, he was on 75
micrograms of fentanyl, which was to be
[SPEAKER_09]: changed every 72 hours, 40 milligrams of
extended release morphine two times a day,
[SPEAKER_09]: 15 milligrams of immediate release
morphine five times a day as needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was basically a numb zombie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was falling down a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, enough of this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not eating, not pooping, not
communicating.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when Shannon and I first met.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was like, well, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_09]: She gave me some products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, she gave me those suppositories at
first.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, you stick that up your butt.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_09]: After 45 years of marriage, you're going
to tell me that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Stick this little pinky thing compared to
some.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I do it, you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, it was,
he had had a colonoscopy that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were like, you've already had it
stretched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already inflated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was when he said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I've already been violated once.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he is someone that is in a lot of
chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, those, the to be prescribed that
much more pain to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those the coins that looks like a
quarter?
[SPEAKER_09]: What the morphine pills?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no, they're actually very small.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, then the government
has gotten to the point also where they're
[SPEAKER_09]: like, Oh, we're going to let you take all
these pills for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're going to take them away from
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened to a friend of mine
recently.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have people going out onto the
streets and they're buying them and we're
[SPEAKER_09]: getting more heroin addicts now because
heroin is cheaper than pills on the
[SPEAKER_09]: street.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: So guys, I'm telling you, cannabis,
I'll tell you, if you have an opioid
[SPEAKER_09]: addiction, these suppositories help you
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause when you start kicking opioids,
you get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you try to wean slowly,
you get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your body missing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been spoiling yourself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your body doesn't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congrats to, is he still as grumpy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's going to Vegas with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll live up to his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do we want to brag about that for a
second?
[SPEAKER_09]: We should finish this talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep talking about why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a good way of putting this back
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might forget though, but more
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, I mean, any kind of lower
extremities, I would say anywhere from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the heart down, you could,
you could find relief in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what your symptoms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, because it's a one-to-one
ratio, 50-50 THC and CBD, you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefits of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it's just, it's the two catalyze
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just overall beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list could go on and on,
but I mean, for me personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nerve damage, sciatic nerve issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was almost paralyzed in a jet ski
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it flares up from time to
time and it swells up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's what I use them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls obviously use them for
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer patients use it to relieve
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from their cancer, whatever it
might be, I mean, colon cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're on chemo, you're probably really
nauseous.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to give you pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to give you chytrel,
Zofran.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's all these pills they're going to
give you so you don't get sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need those pills.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can insert one of these suppositories.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to help with the nauseousness.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to help with the pain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to cure your cancer.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what we're saying, but it will
make the quality of what you're going
[SPEAKER_09]: through at that time better.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll make it, I think it will.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've all experienced it in our
own experiences and that's why I'm such an
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, the 70% absorption rate
is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke things, it's about a 10%
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you eat it, it's 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're getting 70% of that 50-50 and
that's a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it comes on quickly and it lasts for
quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, when I take dabs,
I get maybe a good 30-40 minute buzz out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it, but the suppositories seem to be…
Oh, you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the lingering part,
that 15 minutes of, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you just get that, I might be
kind of, I could eat some cookies or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they come on quickly and they
last, they seem to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waves go for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The waves are fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking maybe I would take them if
I had to go on a plane ride or a car trip
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'm sitting for a long time because
my lower back and my knees start to get
[SPEAKER_02]: mad about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it might be cool to have those on a
plane trip or something where I'm cramped
[SPEAKER_02]: in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that same like anytime I'm sitting
for a long time and I drive a lot just
[SPEAKER_00]: with calling on dispensaries and just
getting the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't typically do it while I'm
driving just because like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of deadens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I want to have my reaction times,
but as soon as I stop or have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at the end of the day,
I'm taking them for the release.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Computer time when you're honking the
computer work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting there in the chair, letting your
bottom half go numb.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys all have the same look on your
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that used a suppository had the
same look on their face.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all bobbing their head at the
same rhythm.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: What other products do you carry though at
CGC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, one of our highest things that
we've been popular have been our bath
[SPEAKER_00]: bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, we have three different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hundred milligram THC with 15
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we've got the solventless in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're foaming bath bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they have the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually bubbles involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colors are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't heavily color them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, want to keep it as clean as
possible, but there is a color in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, differentiate scents and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lavender and citrus ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Granny, when I offered her
products, she loves our solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: caviar, loves the suppositories,
obviously, you know, definitely dabs our
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, but she was like, yeah,
I'm not a bath person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I respected that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't take baths, Granny?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like showers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should just throw it away.
I'm a shower guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to lay in my own dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently she caught a cold and I saw
her on Facebook or on Instagram on one of
[SPEAKER_00]: her live feeds and I was heading down this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I dropped some stuff off at one
of her Epic remedies, one of the local
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries that we do business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Granny, I know shops there and we all
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're a great company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just dropped it off and texted her
and I said, I know you're not a bath
[SPEAKER_00]: person, but this will make you feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I dropped her off some eucalyptus mint
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effervescence.
[SPEAKER_09]: The eucalyptus opened up everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: The CBDs had me relaxed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was down with just my nose out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when the water got cold,
I let some out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran all our hot water out.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how long I just, oh, these are
pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've done probably four of them since
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love watching the girls on Instagram and
YouTube drop the bath bomb in there and it
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to fizz out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you take a bath bomb?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really do baths.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting in and out of the bath is more
painful than it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get all your body parts in the
tub at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would need a hot tub size one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've gone to some hotels just because
I know they have big hot tubs or big bath
[SPEAKER_02]: tubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they get me in some places.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all you ganjapreneurs out there,
what we need is a CBD shower head.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: An isolation tank filled with CBD water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, they make that CBD water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put a bath bomb in the float tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would that do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in the bath bombs there's
actually, there's all kinds of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: other things in there, including the THC
and CBD, but there's epsom salts in them
[SPEAKER_00]: and essential oils and a few other things
that bind it together and make it pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and make it foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of the cannabinoids does your
skin develop or de-develop?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the word I wanted, but I think
you know what I meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporate, like soak in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ruined everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody could find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny had to help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon got it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I honestly don't have a, there's no
science that has, I could quote that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would feel comfortable saying it's this
kind of percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just from everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your skin is your largest organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's obviously when you get in a tub of
hot water, it's absorbing and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: epsom salts in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just collecting on and absorbing
into your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, the effects that they've had is
they say that it's the best night's sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: they've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, I had pulled my back and I
took a bath and the next morning they,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they might still be sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to at least function or get
to work still, or get to the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to call a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I believe in my opinion that
it helps people with, especially out here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado, dry skin, psoriasis,
things like that, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are topical issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any topical, it's being absorbed
through your skin.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they do hydrate your skin.
[SPEAKER_09]: You feel very soft when you get out of the
tub.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's oils in there, essential,
like not just essential oils as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: scents, but there's like MCT oil and
coconut oils and almond oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's not coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is sweet almond oils sometimes used
and depending on which flavors or scents,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can always say flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all those things like they're all made
just a little bit different and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, so yeah, I mean, it's just those oils
carry the cabininoids into the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's definitely an absorption,
but to give you an exact quote on a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, I have no scientific facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, just personally,
do you think somebody that did not smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: or consume edibles or anything,
would they pass a drug test from using a
[SPEAKER_02]: bath bomb?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but we could probably find a
candidate to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know somebody that doesn't smoke
that you want to drop a bath bomb on?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I- We'll find out what that does
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some curious friends that are not
cannabis consumers that, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no high to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not actually- Is there any THC in
it at all from the CBD that your skin will
[SPEAKER_09]: absorb?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I mean- You want them to try a
THC one to see if they can- Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if it gets in through the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need somebody who doesn't consume,
which so that might be a test that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to try just to- I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I mean, you can buy a test
at the grocery store and- Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it tests.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because that would be- I don't know
anybody that doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do know somebody, but I don't know if
they would be down- I know one person that
[SPEAKER_11]: would be down for it, but I don't-
Actually, I- We'll find a test subject
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime soon and I'll report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can't find one, let me know because
I know one for sure that I can- We'll make
[SPEAKER_02]: it a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very curious because you said the skin
is the largest organ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If our lungs take in so much, how much can
our skin absorb?
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all just going to be slathering up
with THC creamers pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because otherwise, all topicals,
I mean, they wouldn't work if our skin
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't absorbing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any Arnica gel, anything like that would
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those products are excellent
sources of pain relief, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: specific areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a topical?
[SPEAKER_00]: A salve?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not trying to recreate the
wheel with this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our goal is to find new inventive
ways and connoisseur grade type products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at like, we're not that much more
expensive than the big guys that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so for a few dollars more,
you can have something that's completely
[SPEAKER_00]: clean if that's your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have smoked BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be a snob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've smoked- We have some here on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's right here on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sick and I don't have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't make that decision for somebody
who might have a more serious condition.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it doesn't affect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm willing to take that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else might not want to have to
take that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to offer those people a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sorry, I got off point.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're going beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I'm not trying to recreate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a topical that I'm wanting to
bring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to go, like I said,
connoisseur grade and I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing out a body butter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dry skin again, a big effect out
here in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sunburns and you know, there's
already the topicals and the salves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be something that not only
nourishes your skin, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's that connoisseur grade
body, mall body product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to the mall, pay the same
amount of money, or you can pay the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money and you can get it with
cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still equally has all those
effects, but you will get additional
[SPEAKER_00]: effects if you have a need for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell like strawberries and
watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have THC all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things that I'm
working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of price point do the
suppositories go for if somebody wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're the distributor and the
maker, so you don't set the price,
[SPEAKER_00]: but... The retail price runs, I want to
say right around $16.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for 50, 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 12 hours of Medicaid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what do you need the
medicine for?
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody who doesn't have pain buying
a topical, doesn't have sore muscles or a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint ache, why would you buy a topical
that's a salve?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about application and what you
need it for, in my personal opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where you're willing to spend your
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know of dispensaries in the
Colorado Springs, Denver area where people
[SPEAKER_02]: can grab these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a list of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can become prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm prepared, but not overly prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me two seconds to pull that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect for the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will say, we're going to shout out
one of our favorite dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic Remedy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually just swung through there right
before we did the podcast and I picked up
[SPEAKER_11]: a whole bunch of dabble products from
them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went in there earlier this morning and
we walked in and a shout out to Dusty in
[SPEAKER_11]: there because Dusty was like, drop
happening later, come back.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just picked up a syringe and I think
I grabbed like a, oh, I grabbed a New York
[SPEAKER_11]: city diesel shatter from them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked pretty good in the container,
which is why I scooped it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But man, when you open it, that's it right
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, like I would compare it to a
very well known- And this is dabble?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is Kraft actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would compare that to- And that's
what I was just going to say to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to pass this around so
everybody can try this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's exactly what I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the first thing I said when it came
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, oh, and it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, big shout out to Epic Remedy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dusty and everybody in there always hooks
us up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And their prices are very, very
affordable.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a deal going every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product that we are shortly coming
out with, we've got a solvent list of
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, but we're also, the pen market is
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, the vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a solvent list pen
out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, will be available in our
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanted to know where we are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Springs area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, so what I want to disclose
before I give you this list is not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody carries all of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to contact,
if that's your suspensory and ask them,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, do you have their rosin or their
suppositories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of them carry some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all of our products.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time this comes out, that may have
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be out Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A wellness here in the Colorado or in
the Springs area, the 64 store,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabacare, Tweedleaf, and Grant Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stained Glass is a huge supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mindful Elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Epic Remedy, we already talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enlighten Care and I think that's Green
Meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just the Green Cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is Green Meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do have one partner that we're
working with up in Fort Collins and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are just doing amazing things up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Natural Alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Denver area, we've got Live Green,
which is patient's choice on Colfax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Affinity is on Colfax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be Good carries our stuff up in North
Glen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenfields is another one and their
sister store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they have two stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in Denver and one up North.
[SPEAKER_02]: People in other states are probably
punching something going, they have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these places to go buy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little Brown House in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lotus Medical has us downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lush, Standing Akimbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Giving Tree and Kind Love is
currently- Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's encouraged me to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way they're set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way they handle business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow, the medicine, the people,
the quality, the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind Love is a nice dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they carry suppositories there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bath Bombs right now is what they're
carrying with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they've got the best clones
I've ever seen available in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind Love, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually got some of our original
clones for our grow from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we worked with them when we first
were getting established back last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shannon has been working hard on her grow
for her company.
[SPEAKER_09]: They grow some lemon Jeffrey at Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still a small company, but we've got
a great chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brent, our grower, does a great job in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our two owners, majority owners are really
just doing a great job running the
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just happy to be part of all of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be able to meet people like you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're glad to have you on to teach people
about suppositories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a Pueblo place where people
can buy it by any chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, if you're in the Pueblo area
and you have a dispensary that wants our
[SPEAKER_00]: product, go in and ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you guys to ask for our products
and that will help me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it medical only or rec too?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just went rec not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the rec side, we're limited because
our grows not quite established yet on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rec side for that first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're only working on ancillary
products being bath bombs and
[SPEAKER_00]: suppositories can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody needs them on the rec side
too, of course, I'm happy to fulfill those
[SPEAKER_00]: needs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start making the requests, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start asking your dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the dispensary, they don't
have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Traveling Stoner and Dab and
Granny, and I'm not popular, but on my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram as well, there is a list of all
these dispensaries that you can find that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've shouted out for me and been so
helpful to help promote for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon, you are one of the cool kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm cool with not being the cool kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to hang out with y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram doesn't make you famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought great content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I know everyone's already
following the Traveling Stoner and the Dab
[SPEAKER_02]: and Granny, but if you're not,
go follow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find those list of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are recreational dispensaries on the
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're coming from out of state,
if you're coming from another country,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're 21 and over, you can get these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take a bath.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drop a bath bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: In there, you can get a suppository.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put that where the sun don't
shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I endorse these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to tell your dispensary who to
contact, my Instagram name is
[SPEAKER_00]: sserendipity93.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that I'm the CDC manager on there
and marketing manager and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they can DM me, they can Instagram
me, they can call me directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm definitely accessible if
they have questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys heard that hissing sound,
that is not a deadly Cobra.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a can of butane refilling a torch
because Bobo over here needs a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he just gave Lindsay- She gave me
the most witty- I had to take a macro of
[SPEAKER_11]: it because he just gave me the most- Is it
a turptail?
[SPEAKER_11]: He put a piece of shatter, then he dipped
it in the CBD, and then he just coated it
[SPEAKER_11]: in distillate.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm watching him and I'm like,
is he going to stop putting distillate on
[SPEAKER_11]: it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he going to stop putting distillate?
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not going to stop putting- And what
do you got for CBD?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the spiderweb of all the CBD I sent
on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was falling off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're missing the nail, brother man.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's trying to get on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Watch my dreads.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's all I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, if you could see this table,
I'm sitting here looking and I forget that
[SPEAKER_09]: this isn't the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if this was Texas, we'd all go to
prison for life for what's on this table.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have probably 10 tubes of distillate
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's two, four, six, seven,
eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 10 tubes of distillate within my
site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably another 10 containers of turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two ounces of shatter in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven rigs on the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is just how we roll.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't get it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, Shannon, stick it inside of here so
it heats up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an unopened distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people would be mad at us for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other states would we go to prison
for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky, Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd come in the front door and just
take us to jail forever.
Florida.
[SPEAKER_10]: Florida still, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Granny, a minute ago, you started to
hint to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'm going to get you talking
about your Vegas trip and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has invited you and the grumpy grandpa
to Vegas?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something I'm very excited about
because
[SPEAKER_09]: anybody that follows me on social media
will fly you and grumpy grandpa out there
[SPEAKER_09]: together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, you're kidding me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, no, we'd like to have the
both of you come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll put you up in a hotel.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, well, I've got to talk it over
with my husband.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hung up and I asked Kevin and he
said, I feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if I have to stay in my hotel room,
I think you and I can take a trip to
[SPEAKER_09]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to beta glass labs for making
this trip come true.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to see some great glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like five years since you guys
have taken any kind of vacation together
[SPEAKER_09]: because he's been so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been blessed lately, Granny.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had lots of good things come my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been doing things correctly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe you reap what you sow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not out there to make money.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out there to, well, I'm out to promote
a lot of young artists that I see here in
[SPEAKER_09]: the Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out to help educate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm out to have fun while I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you were achieving all three of
those goals.
[SPEAKER_09]: This year things are coming to fruition
though.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, okay guys, tonight here we sit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, we had all those products on
the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something we didn't say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Clyde side edibles from
Glasgow, Scotland.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way from Scotland.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a care package yesterday of edibles
and t-shirts from Glasgow, Scotland.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I opened them up and everybody was
like, Ooh, Bob, tell you what,
[SPEAKER_09]: their edibles are pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That chocolate marshmallow thing looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked very dense, but man,
it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just glad that it was only THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We joked about some of this maybe having
possible other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've still got these little chocolate,
not chocolate, these hard candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are pineapple chunks made with sour
diesel cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 50 milligrams per bag,
2.5 milligrams per cube.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cubes are small and they remind me of
some mescaline I got on fish school one
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was very apprehensive to eat these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not eat any.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of my friends that did eat them seem
to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smell good, but they look,
those little squares look very suspicious
[SPEAKER_02]: to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, who would even think that you
would be eating THC edibles from Scotland?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I gotta say they have really
big balls of Scotland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause not only did they ship this to her,
but they had it labeled right in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sweets and t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did he say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did he say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then I said to him, well, I want to
know what does a Scotsman wear under his
[SPEAKER_09]: kilt?
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, if they're a true Scotsman
like me, nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's balls in the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these edibles were made by a dude not
wearing any underwear.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope he wasn't scratching.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a skirt on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it easier to insert his suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably send him back a care
package.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am not messing with shipping anything to
Scotland.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll wait a few more years on that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: None of us said that either.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not only did I get something from
Glasgow, Scotland, I'm going to shout out
[SPEAKER_09]: long bong official.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I tell the whole world?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that porn?
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now these guys have a, like, it's like a
six foot bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on Instagram, you can tell the
whole story too, if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're on Instagram, you will see this
big six foot bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will say it looks kind of appealing
and it's metal and crystal and it's called
[SPEAKER_09]: Stanley kind of like flat Stanley.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to travel around to
different weed people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had messaged this company,
not knowing anything about them saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, can Stanley come to my house to
review?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, yes, he could.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a couple of months later,
they said, granny, we can't secure
[SPEAKER_09]: Stanley.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, what do you mean you can't secure
Stanley?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said, well, we'll get back to
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a month ago, they say to me,
granny, custom grow 420 has Stanley and he
[SPEAKER_09]: won't respond to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: He will not give Stanley back.
[SPEAKER_13]: So custom grow is holding Stanley hostage.
[SPEAKER_09]: He likes Stanley.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not going to give Stanley back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that probably is no big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a company here in the United
States, I'd just go find custom grow 420.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys are in Slovakia, which is the
former Czechoslovakia.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no chase in custom grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told them, I can't find custom grow
420, but I'll, I'll tell everybody this
[SPEAKER_09]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tell everybody that follows all of
us on Twitter and that listen to this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast to send a message to custom grow
and be like return Stanley.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this company was so nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sent me their second bong,
which is called T O T E O.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very big.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is hand blown Czechoslovakian crystal,
Bohemian crystal.
[SPEAKER_09]: How tall would you say it is from the
table?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's 24 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably easily, easily, because if I
stand up, the mouthpiece is right where
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm standing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I'm pretty tall, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are a tall lady.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they sent me this bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really like it, but I, who's going
to get a bong ship from Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_13]: Only Davin Granny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Only Davin Granny.
Only.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we should, we should, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: How does that thing hit?
[SPEAKER_13]: I get hella high off that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen the video on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's real bubbly.
[SPEAKER_13]: That perk is like.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, uh, describe the shape of it for
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: You told us how tall it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks kind of like a big crystal liter,
two liter bottle, three liter bottle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, and then there's this metal perk
that, and it's all done on a lathe.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a video up where you can
actually see them making it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I know people are like, Ooh,
I don't want to smoke on a metal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoked out a way worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I still use a Bic lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bring your hip wick toward me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't get my, you can't get your bowl
hot enough to fill your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to light the hip wick with the
lighter and then light my bowl with the
[SPEAKER_02]: hip wick and then shake the hip wick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a candle going.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that's too many damn things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a lighter and smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, it's like a three liter bottle
with this perk.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's this great big tall piece
that comes up off the top that you fill
[SPEAKER_09]: with ice gives hella rips, but it's not
really practical.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So once you put it down somewhere,
it should stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very crystal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even, it is crystal.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that crystal is thick.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, I think it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a bomb.
[SPEAKER_09]: They shipped it to you from Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they thought I spoke Slovakian
cause I was trying to be nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I Googled, I Googled simple Slovakian
phrases and I cut and paste and they
[SPEAKER_09]: replied with a paragraph and I was like,
Oh no, I don't speak Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just being polite.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're very nice people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to long bong official.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that bong is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't say bong very much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like smoking out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I might have to clean my bong and go at it
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, maybe the next time we set,
I'll have to take it apart, but there's
[SPEAKER_09]: screws to take some assembly is required.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll bring it to Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll do a few bong rips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I do a few more shout outs?
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now on my Instagram, I got a really
nice giveaway going on with Freaky Smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: Shop here in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a e-nail, a rig that Lindsay and I
have been smoking out of.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a titanium pencil and I signed the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says Peace, Deb and Granny 2017.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a few other, what do you call
them?
[SPEAKER_09]: Swag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Swag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more swag to give away.
[SPEAKER_09]: God dang.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all might be medicated
properly.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I can't even think of simple words,
it's bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, where is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so that is the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the one thing I want to say is I
reached 250,000 followers on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've surpassed that even now.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the time this comes out, you'll be way
past that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at 252 or two, but that just amazes
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am going to be doing a hell of a
appreciation giveaway.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I know Beta Glass
Labs is going to donate one of their rigs
[SPEAKER_09]: to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then somebody I absolutely adore here in
the Springs, Popti Glass, has already
[SPEAKER_09]: blown a piece to give me for the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet I can get a few other nice little
glass blowers here in the Springs to give
[SPEAKER_09]: us some nice things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just be keeping an eye out for my 250
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then of course I've got to thank my
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm back to repping Megatoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually like smoking concentrate
out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, I'm done shouting out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give a shout out to Elevate
while we're at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all need Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to Becca and the whole crew
over at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beautiful ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're all Elevate dolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those dudes are dolls.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked him, what do I call you?
[SPEAKER_09]: He said I'm a doll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up Turtle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're listening by the man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, maybe we should shout out a few
companies that we've been getting our CBD
[SPEAKER_09]: from because some of these companies,
even you people in states that aren't
[SPEAKER_09]: legal, you can order CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so far they're still delivering.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can direct you to empirewellness.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think anybody that sampled their CBD
tonight or their terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their terps are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've helped me get medicine to
patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: All Dank Distillate Dabs here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: He is still shipping nationwide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trinity Turpenes, they're still shipping
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Fido Family, they're still shipping
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_09]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're still shipping to Dab and
Granny.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe even, Oh, and John Ramsey,
what's his company?
[SPEAKER_09]: Infinite CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's still shipping.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see those guys talking about it on
Facebook and Instagram all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get CBD out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all the CBD warriors.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing I will say is we've got a
lot of great CBD manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, extractors, whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then we also have a lot of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have these CBD wars where they're all
biting and scratching at each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't deal with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will not endorse just one company.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will endorse them all because then
they've got to be nice to all others.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our followers.
[SPEAKER_09]: It happens in the seed game also.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sure Jeff, you can probably speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, the older I get, the more I'm like,
well, this is stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just chill out and be nice to each
other and do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's room for all of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: There shouldn't be a competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a consumer for every product
that's made.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's enough of us, patients and
consumers out there that none of you are
[SPEAKER_09]: going to go out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smoke all of this hash on this
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a provider for more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsay, you doubt me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm laughing because Bobo just tried to
smell a glass syringe, like in the middle
[SPEAKER_11]: of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it have any smell, bro?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you, have you tried that one yet?
No.
[SPEAKER_13]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to ask you, whose is
this?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of these companies and their
packaging are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This package is, what else comes in a
package this size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like toothpaste almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pad, the product that comes in it
is, I'm trying to find something.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else is this size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else is this small.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they have to put it in that
plastic as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to put it in this box with
everything printed on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we put it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This syringe is a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a bigger syringe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But still couldn't the labeling go on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on to here, but then it wouldn't be
consumer friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the packaging, all my, so much
packaging in Colorado, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's garbage is what I call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all landfill material,
unless you recycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know a lot of people that should,
that don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighborhood doesn't support much
recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: If, if your trash company isn't going to
help you, it's hard to recycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's, let's admit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you compost, don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do what I can, but I can't compost
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have enough space and some stuff
stinks.
[SPEAKER_09]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't want that in your home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you talked about actually,
when you talked on one of your podcasts
[SPEAKER_09]: about some of the things and I was like,
Oh, his house smelt like a home,
[SPEAKER_09]: not like a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nailing it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I've got kind of my Bokashi bucket
is right over there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes that sucker can stink.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't smell it at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff's home is very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it looks like it's a dude's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could use a, it could use a cleaning.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have a pink bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, back to the pink bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to all my
triplet friends in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's wearing their girl from your
heart podcast hoodie and looking super
[SPEAKER_02]: sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my friends at handmade
apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm supposed to do an ad for
handmade apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys need some printing done,
I might have to hit them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You please do please use me as a reference
about both of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need hoodies, t-shirts,
if you need hat pins, if you need
[SPEAKER_02]: stickers, you need some stuff printed and
you want it to look sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: How dope are the colors on those hoodies?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, they're vivid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys washed yours?
[SPEAKER_11]: I have washed mine twice now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still look brand new.
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually look sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: No cracks in the back or anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: No issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: But do you do, are you, are you friendly
to your hoodie?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you turn it inside out?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should turn it inside out when you
wash it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll last even longer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it won't crack.
[SPEAKER_09]: The stuff won't crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then your logo is not beaten on
the parts of the washer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the dryer's not heating up,
you know, the actual logo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like making it stick together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Life hack.
[SPEAKER_09]: Teaching people the lessons.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens when you're 69.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not 25.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm getting, getting up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're starting to learn all them little
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, uh, this is one of the original
iRegenetic shirts, the very first batch
[SPEAKER_02]: printed by Handmade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably, I'm going to guess this
is seven years old and it's just now
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to kind of starting at the edges
to look weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's crackling, but the shirt is like
not even black anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all dingy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a work shirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like one of your favorite concert
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got, I bought a lot of these
shirts and I think most of the extra extra
[SPEAKER_02]: larges went to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if there's a festival,
excuse me for the cough guys, if there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: festival, if there's an event,
brand new iRegenetic shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got to rock the brand new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I try to set it aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I forget and I end up wearing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, oh, there's another
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand new iRegenetic shirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys really should order one of your
girl from your heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are nice hoodies.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are real and they're really warm.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a coat on tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a little camisole underneath it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris and I went camping for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: We went January 2nd, we got in the car and
we went camping and it was snowing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was snowing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was 20 degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, uh, I wore the grow from your heart
podcast, uh, sweatshirt all night with
[SPEAKER_11]: like, um, probably like two layers
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was so warm all night.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I was not, I didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cozy hoodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a double advertisement right
there.

[SPEAKER_05]: I've secretly gotten asked multiple times
what this hoodie is on multiple occasions.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we tell people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the back is the best because you got
Rasta Jeff's cheesy face.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is super cheesy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just makes you smile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes, you know, I have to go in the
bathroom and just turn around and put my
[SPEAKER_09]: camera there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a really friendly deal
because of what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, dude, we want to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's a lot of color in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like nine colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to our friends at handmade
apparel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, since we talked about all the other
companies that we were supporting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lindsay, don't you have a few new
sponsors?
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, nothing you want to talk about right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, well, I mean, I can let you guys know
that my website will be up and running at
[SPEAKER_11]: the end of the month.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my blog, the blog portion of my website
will at least be up and running at the end
[SPEAKER_11]: of the month.
[SPEAKER_13]: The end of which month?
[SPEAKER_11]: This month.
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we hear that the last podcast?
[SPEAKER_11]: When was I here the last time?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was before the food thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've actually been working really
hard on it and it will be out at the end
[SPEAKER_11]: of this month.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I have nothing else that I am
working on right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the only thing I've been working
on.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it will definitely be out at the end of
this month.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I troll you is cause I
love this shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I didn't realize I had said that at
the end of the last one.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris is nodding.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So he saw me setting it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was setting it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris was like, Oh, let me do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so since granny reminded me and it was
in my notes, I didn't even open my
[SPEAKER_02]: notebook because we had so much to talk
about on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My notes stayed on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all organic and natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, how was the food drive you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that go?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know, I actually, the day that they
picked everything up, I was at my sister's
[SPEAKER_11]: wedding in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out to granny and Sam and Bailey
and everybody else that came out and
[SPEAKER_09]: helped Sam, Bailey and I, and then the,
um, people at the Marion house.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when we pulled up at night and those
people were on the dock and I opened it up
[SPEAKER_09]: and she went, and I got out of the truck
and I came up and I said, I wasn't going
[SPEAKER_09]: to tell you until I got here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this all came from the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she goes, where did you get all this
food?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, all the food and there's toys
in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's money in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it all came from dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting my hair is standing up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me so happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was like, wow, you guys really
made a difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had a U-Haul truck from ceiling to
floor, front to back that was full of
[SPEAKER_09]: food.
[SPEAKER_09]: Toys.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some, um, brand new kids,
hats, gloves, lots of new toys for the
[SPEAKER_09]: kids.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I spoke with the lady,
I was so impressed with this program and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's all through the Marion house,
Catholic charities.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not religious, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had, do you know what I mean by
gorilla shelves?
[SPEAKER_09]: Those metal shelves.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had several of those different
categories and they have a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: displaced families.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_09]: The parents have to take parenting
classes, which I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good because if you're young,
you know, I was young and dumb once too,
[SPEAKER_09]: you need help.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we get a lot of people coming here
because of the cannabis community and they
[SPEAKER_09]: don't have a plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a solid plan in place and
sometimes kids, kids suffer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, these gorilla shelves have brand
new toys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's a kid's birthday, they get to
come in and they get to pick a brand new
[SPEAKER_09]: toy.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had so many brand new toys.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need diapers, you can go down there
and get, if you need diapers, people,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can go down to the Marion house and
get diapers.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no questions asked.
[SPEAKER_09]: Diapers are expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just felt, yes, we did make a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that seems like an eternity ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a while ago, but thank you for
doing it because of the smile on your face
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's priceless.
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me really happy to know that we
helped so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine the looks on the little kids faces
when they, cause they know the little kids
[SPEAKER_02]: know like we're fucked, we didn't get
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know, they can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their parents don't tell them,
but they know we live in a thing and we
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't getting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they get a present and they're
like, Oh my God, I got a $5 dinosaur that
[SPEAKER_02]: made my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And kids, you know, kids shouldn't have to
be punished for decisions their parents
[SPEAKER_02]: make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lindsay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you weren't there on the day,
but you had a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give a big shout out to Bailey
too, for being a part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually I put up that post tonight
that we were doing the podcast and she
[SPEAKER_11]: commented on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like, yes, I've been looking for the
name of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So big shout out to Bailey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky mountain dabber.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I met her at the Halloween party.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't super talkative at the Halloween
party cause I was in the Chewbacca costume
[SPEAKER_02]: and I kind of overheated myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dehydrated and spinning around in
circles.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, big shout out to Bailey because
she, she got up and helped granny and Sam
[SPEAKER_11]: without any questions asked on her day
off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was cold that day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, she only, she's a bud tender
at, um, Rocky mountain medical over on
[SPEAKER_11]: garden of the gods.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, you know, she probably only gets
a couple of days a week off and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_11]: she didn't have, she has a lot of medical
conditions that, you know, make it hard
[SPEAKER_11]: for her to stay mobile sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the last time they sent her home from
the hospital with a walker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's what 20?
[SPEAKER_11]: She's about my age.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So big shout out to Bailey for,
you know, we love you baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a trooper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to THC Samuel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For helping with that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for being THC Samuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam has a lot to talk about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam was just out on the west coast,
started down in San Francisco with JD
[SPEAKER_09]: Mapleson.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all heady glassblowers guys
started down in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_09]: worked his way up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, spent the night with Derby Holmes and
the Holmes family and ended his trip with
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Snodgrass, 85 year old legend in the
glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the school bus.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam has a lot to talk about from this last
trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get Samuel on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the perfect person for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he just, I love him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, when I say these are heady
glassblowers, I don't know if any of us
[SPEAKER_09]: sitting here can probably afford any of
these pieces.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: When Sam texts me that he was at Derby
Holmes and we, Sam and I have come to know
[SPEAKER_09]: the Holmes family.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, all I could afford was a carb
cap.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the carb cap is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm telling you guys that wasn't like
a five, 10, 20, $30, a hundred.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's a beautiful dykro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's peach, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it's peach.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it has these two green leafs on
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a gorgeous carb cap and it's a
directional flow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it is a truly finely gorgeous piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: But these glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them pieces are a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, that's a car sitting
on the shelf right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shout out to THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam and I both have been survivors of head
injuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sam, of course, has had a couple more
than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one major one and one when I was
a youth, but we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: head injuries and we're going to talk
about heady glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get Sam on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to talk about the East
coast because he's from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask him some weird questions
about the East coast and see what he's got
[SPEAKER_02]: to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big shout out to Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everybody that helped in the
food drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to every dispensary that
allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My throat's bright to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should say that it wasn't just
dispensaries that did this just before you
[SPEAKER_11]: start.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause like the canyon was a part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the family joint, the family joint was
the lazy lion, the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, elevate glass for glass grind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, DBK, is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary and, and Dylan, is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a whole list of them on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to all the, everybody that let us
have a drop off spot, a box and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that brought stuff to the boxes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all those folks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give a special shout out
though to Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, for this honest to God,
this is what cemented my relationship with
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had lots of people that took our boxes,
but this is what Epic remedy did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic remedy didn't care how many cans of
new food you brought in.
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave you a dollar per can off your
product that you were.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And after a week, I was like rents.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're taking a hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he goes, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the holidays.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're giving back to the community.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to rents and Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, that dispenser was in the
poorest neighborhood of all the
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensaries that was over in Pike's peak
park over on circle and fountain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is one of the poorest neighborhoods
that of any of the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_09]: but they collected the most food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gail had to go over there countless of
times.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like honestly, we ran the thing for like
about three weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there probably twice a week,
two to three times a week.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was going over there and picking up
not just like a box full pallets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like she had to take the truck over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the entire truck was like,
every time I would get like pictures and
[SPEAKER_11]: like, just got back from Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to, uh, seventh floor silver
surf for Steve.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't really anticipate getting as
much stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were going to hold it all at the glass
grind.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when, when Epic remedy called me
the first time and I drive a Silverado,
[SPEAKER_09]: so the entire back of my truck was full of
food.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Steve said, can you have my warehouse?
[SPEAKER_09]: So he let us store all the food out there
for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then when I did get to Utah, his whole
crew loaded the truck up for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to the entire seven floor
vapes crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause they, they were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: What are we doing next?
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start working on another food drive
or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to help the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll definitely have to do something.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about it on the next episode
when we bring granny on again.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll brainstorm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam is coming up with lots of good ideas
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam's a thinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kid's head never stops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just brain keeps just spinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys check out THC magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the finest cover on a magazine ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the best, uh, I don't know
what the whatever print stock they use
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff is glossy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's available in Barnes and Noble across
the nation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like anybody anywhere can get it now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm in this month's episode or no,
it's not episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an awesome picture of me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What did action say to you?
[SPEAKER_09]: He said I was going to come on ancient
aliens.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to do it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I told him, well, I see you smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't smoke a lot of blunts.
[SPEAKER_09]: So your friends can't be sitting on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to leave room on the couch for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to break in all these heavy
pieces that I know you just bought today
[SPEAKER_09]: at heaters.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did he feel about all that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Three pieces.
[SPEAKER_09]: You bought three sweet pieces.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got three, at least three dabs
coming with, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know some of them are buck pieces too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what was that?
[SPEAKER_13]: You told me that he made, he gave you a
quote of what was Bronson's quote of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What he said he had to go do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you asked him to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can't do impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but it's still funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just knowing Bronson.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, he's got this thick Bronx accent and
he said, let's go get a sausage.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_09]: And he just kind of looked at me and I
said, say it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just love the way it sounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you people from New York say sausages
appealing to one's ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably feel the same about us weird
Colorado folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably think we say some funny shit
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: He really is a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do hope I get to sit down with him
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you get to be on the ancient alien
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope maybe vice just comes and does a
dab and granny show because you deserve
[SPEAKER_02]: some recognition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of shows, I believe, uh,
the traveling stoner and Bobo just did an
[SPEAKER_09]: episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I please give a shout out to daily
bong?
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to daily bong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Daily bong just had Chris and I on,
um, blunted a season two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and it was actually really funny
because like we get there and like,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, he, he, he had messaged me like,
honestly, he messaged me a month ago and
[SPEAKER_11]: he was like, Hey, I'm thinking,
you know, I'm going to be coming out into,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, Colorado and I'd love to get you and
your man on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just really like, Y'all's vibes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd love to be on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew about the show because of metal
Damien.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so he, uh, he's on the show all the
time because it's filmed in Miami.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, so I said, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So then he messaged me at the beginning of
the month and he's like, Oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_11]: be out there on the 15th and 16th.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, coolio.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we get there and I really, I just love
watch the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that the way the show goes is
you sit in front of a really bright light.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you wear sunglasses and you smoke
either like a joint or a blunt or
[SPEAKER_11]: something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he asks you questions and you just
answer them and like the questions are,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, in the bottom of the,
uh, of the like screen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just knew that we were going to get
asked questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, he had put up a picture that
morning and he had tagged a bunch of
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't really know how, how it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he doesn't let anybody like be around
each other when they get taped.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're on the same episode and
like, you can get be in the same room.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we get there and he goes, Oh,
your episodes all about relationships.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, I stone face.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, you picked the wrong couple,
dude, straight up.
[SPEAKER_11]: You pick the wrong couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not the classic TV show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if that's what you were looking for
out of this, you pick the wrong couple.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was really funny because it was like
the newlywed game style kind of like we
[SPEAKER_11]: didn't even stay in the room with each
other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he asked us pretty much the same
questions and like to see how we answer
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was pretty comical to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our episode is supposed to come out at the
end of March.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're episode four of season two.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he, um, texted me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll be back here at the end of January
and asked what I may become up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm asking if maybe you guys will take
me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Daily bong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Daily bong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to them because they,
it was so much fun to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: He asked just like, I mean, just,
I don't want to spoil our, our episodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll tell you what's been on other
episodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was really funny cause I,
I was at the Canna Canyon a couple of days
[SPEAKER_11]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to spoil somebody else's
episode?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's season one.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I was at the Canna Canyon the other
day and I was showing Camille like the day
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, yo, look at what I get to go
and do the other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I'm kind of excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was the only person I told.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even tell granny.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like granny called me on the way up and
she's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, okay, I'm going to do this
really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was showing Camille this and it was
really funny because the question was ice
[SPEAKER_11]: cream or anal and the amount of like guys
that chose ice cream was insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it was so funny to me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just mind blowing to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And me and Cam were both like,
I can't believe how many people are saying
[SPEAKER_11]: ice cream right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like this is actually insane to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they thought they had to receive
instead of give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be saying ice cream too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But so like, so some of the questions are
like, what's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like, so yeah, it's just really
funny because he just asks you these like
[SPEAKER_11]: questions and he doesn't ask them in a
certain order.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's no like, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's not like a gradual thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what's your name?
[SPEAKER_11]: Ice cream or anal?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's so back and forth like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So would you just add Chris?
[SPEAKER_13]: That shit smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it a turp tail?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, he's making a video.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I can see it right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think he'd the cookies from cookies
from you guys at CGC.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you put some of this syringe on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just did this cookies on its own.
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't use that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, some turps.
[SPEAKER_11]: ACDC turps.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what he put on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled amazing when he blew it in my
face.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a mix of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still smells real good in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a mix of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a little reddish purple now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give him a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, I have to say us dabbers are a
breed of our own.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have this solvent stuff called white
crack.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this stuff smells like some cheese
that has been in a refrigerator with no
[SPEAKER_09]: power for about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: After you had some bad cheese,
you puked it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time I break this stuff out and
people sniff it, their face is like,
[SPEAKER_09]: can I dab it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have some?
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like your butt after a run.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just amazing that we want to dab
something that smells so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab of it just because
I'm brave and I'm very curious what it
[SPEAKER_02]: actually tastes like.
It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes just like your butt after a run.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, after suppository.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's none of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already talked about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it tastes good, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't taste like dog poop.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't taste like the cheesy vomit it
smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheesy vomit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high from it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: White crack OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like a can of dog farts.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we assume that it's probably green
crack.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think the white is?
[SPEAKER_09]: White widow?
[SPEAKER_09]: The white?
[SPEAKER_09]: The white?
[SPEAKER_09]: The white probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me on that rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that extraction companies do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it should say the white and
green crack or something on there because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's misleading.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're medical consumers and we'd like to
know what strains we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of people that don't
have the knowledge or like I have
[SPEAKER_09]: knowledge because I have friends like you
guys that pass it on to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody might walk in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't know what the hell that is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they want it, maybe green crack
gives them panic attacks and the white is
[SPEAKER_09]: perfect for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we all know green crack is a
pretty heavy sativa.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm learning more and more young butt
tenders don't really know what different
[SPEAKER_09]: strains will do.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about something that you did
since we've been talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: suppositories?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a little story that you took a
gram of distillate and you used it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: suppository.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so funny is she actually used green
crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what reminded my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in my notes that are on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put some green crack in your brown
crack and it made you bounce around all
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a heavy sativa.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess for cleaning the house or
something, but it was a little a little
[SPEAKER_09]: too much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not recommend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a pretty high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I'm saying I don't recommend maybe
half a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just use a normal suppository.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: A butt tender told me to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did.
[SPEAKER_09]: They told me to jump off the bridge.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I was going to go ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he meant the entire syringe.
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I will say about these syringes,
they're good for cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to put a little, a little
distillate in your food?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like meatballs and spaghetti sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have some hot cocoa with some
distillate in it later tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, I have a different way to make hot
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shummit bars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Caleb.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see my picture the other night?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I made, I had some s'mores hot cocoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: Made that it was real and I made it with
milk, cold milk, nice and creamy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a 200 milligram Shummit s'mores hot
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I feel warm and fuzzy inside.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of marshmallow cream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I drank that all, all 200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: I slept really good that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made with pure distillate.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb makes good candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I go through these phases where I do
and don't do edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of our good friends may
have just messed up my edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was back on the horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays with me for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, like I feel really good when
I eat the edibles, but the next day I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: slow motion and I'm a very productive dude
and I can't be dragging ass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you got them brain locks like,
Oh, I just, I can't think a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's more, it's more my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm just, I'm weighed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've just got weights on my leg.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much are you eating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was the issue was the two times
that we've eaten too much.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: First time was your own fault.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't realize how much that cake was
really.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a cake birthday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what made the car?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was floating.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was certainly floating.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was in our defense.
[SPEAKER_11]: We tried to do like, you know,
we tried to do smaller slices,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the restaurant was never.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have learned that I'm a strict
vegetarian and they put bacon on the cake
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was a specific section of cake
with no bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super polite about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were courteous and fed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, I'm going to eat this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was super tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the next morning, when I was still
high, when I woke up, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck did they put in that thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was TNT extraction center.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm the plug, not the extension cord
Dwayne as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was both of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Max and Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe I met.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always together.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you probably have, you probably just,
you know, don't realize it, but,
[SPEAKER_11]: or yeah, but yeah, shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that cake was superb.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the bacon that they make, you know,
you don't know, but the bacon that they
[SPEAKER_11]: make is really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, the hash that they make is super
good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, uh, they know that I don't eat the
bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they bring extra concentrates to dab
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we brought this for you
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so that they could kind of make like,
we're sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're involved here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for you listeners out there,
I know you hear them silly ass rumors.
[SPEAKER_09]: About ODN from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to hallucinate like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been trying all night.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Chris's goal to OD on weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: He wants to be the first person to ever OD
on weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to hallucinate from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting it in our butts and it's not
working.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to, you're going to take a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to dab a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to do too many, too,
too many suppositories.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to wake up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have a weed over.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Jeff said, you're going to be hungry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very little lazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, that's, that's why you'll always
see water with dabbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We always have liquids around caffeine and
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep me alive.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: So contrary to the bullshit you hear on
some of them new shows on TV, you're not
[SPEAKER_09]: going to overdose on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way you can die from cannabis is
if a ton of it falls on your head and
[SPEAKER_02]: kills you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe if you're eating a pound and it
lodges in your throat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, but who's going to really,
or if the cops kick in your door and kill
[SPEAKER_02]: you for having it, that's the problem with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Police are more dangerous than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jell-O is more dangerous than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we've been going for an hour and
35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the longest podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason to stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conversation got natural and
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm going to let this keep
going, but you look exhausted over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super quiet and sat back and I was like,
oh, she's got a drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of them waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys were talking about the
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem with them these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so good that you just eat more of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked on this show that we need to
buy edibles that come with like package A
[SPEAKER_02]: and package B and A is medicated and B is
not so that you can eat one of A and then
[SPEAKER_02]: four or five of B and be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we find ourselves wrecked at this
table sometimes when it's edibles night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually looking at doing one of our
edibles being primarily CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to kind of just for that
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cause you know, again, the edibles
market has already been created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to kind of come in and bring
something off or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a high CBD,
low THC ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know exactly what those are yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those to be announced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon come.
Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cannabis industry is always evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how every week there's something
new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have, what's the new thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: The high terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the H T S F E R Q.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you had it for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high terpene full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the new tech.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that sauce kind of, it's where
it separates.
[SPEAKER_11]: That shit I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris doesn't have a microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys saw what it was, how he explained
it to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like trip sauce, but it's potent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he called it and it's super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's straight sativa to the dome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh hell yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he called it sugar wax without the
sugar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you tip it, I mean, it's,
it's a liquidy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's not like this Terps.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like evil lab Terps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What she got is just, she got just the,
the crystals by themselves and then the
[SPEAKER_05]: sauce in its own vial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she got like just the top layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of, of Terps that just comes off in its
own vial of just like lemony, skunky,
[SPEAKER_05]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's shout him out to Yoshi extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make good super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yoshi hit me up brother, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for an hour and 36
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably a good time to wrap
up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everybody's got to get out of town
to get home.
[SPEAKER_02]: These kids live across town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have anything they'd like to
say while they've still got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: people listening to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, you don't want to be like,
check out my Instagram and buy my glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely check out no me glass and
definitely check out bubble blaster cow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have told me, they're like,
dude, I'd love to be on your show,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know what I would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would come and you would talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a microphone and you just run
your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it without a microphone
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come and let me know what you've got to
say.

[SPEAKER_02]: What Patreon is, is a website that would
allow you to support the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: financially.

[SPEAKER_02]: And the Grow From Your Heart podcast was
recently ranked number 963 overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank everybody for listening
on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on Stitcher, we were ranked number 80
in the society and culture category.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we ran a top 100 section on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me super proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for listening, for
supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes doesn't show me a lot of stats or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes doesn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know where I stand on iTunes,
but on Stitcher, we are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also big thank you to everybody who
listened to the episode with Solvent List
[SPEAKER_02]: Shannon and Dad and Granny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Lindsay and Chris were here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did put some stuff in their
butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of messages that said,
Hey bro, as soon as you guys started
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about putting things in your butt,
I checked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends said that he was getting
some mental images and some visuals,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he did not want to contaminate his
brain like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he listened to about three minutes of
the show and checked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize if that was too much for you,
but thanks for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to everybody that listened to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am pulling up a message on my phone
here, but I've got an iPhone and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: acting funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how that shit goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're listening to music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to unlock me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do eight other things to get
to the message you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Mountain Smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few episodes back, I did an episode
called Follow Your Nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked about sour diesel and
Hispanic folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I may be a bit racist calling
about the folks of Latin descent for
[SPEAKER_02]: liking sour diesel, but I felt that was
something that I noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend Mountain Smokes on Snapchat
sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, oh my gosh, the sour diesel bit
so true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being from Gunnison County, another
heavily populated area, sour diesel has
[SPEAKER_02]: always been growing in the basements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was by far the most popular strain
I sold there spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she also says, also love the podcast
once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for the message and big shout
out to my friend Mountain Smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Smokes on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow her on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a cutie.
[SPEAKER_02]: She smokes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a great cannabis activist,
and she is learning a whole bunch and
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming very knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she likes to share that stuff with her
viewers on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check her out and follow her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get
right to an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a long email here about powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I can really give some
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pulling up the email while I talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Longtime listener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike, you got a shout out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will get White Mike back on the
podcast real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a young child.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't be on every episode, but we'll
get him back pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The message goes on to say, anyways,
I will keep this short.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at a commercial scale cultivation
site and we have been fighting powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew for a year now and would love some
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have sprayed fucking everything and I'm
starting to tap out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's indoor and it's in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he signs it.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then his name, I'm not sure if he
wants everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, PS, you can say my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: We out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks Mathias 585 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's M-A-T-H-I-U-S 585 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow him if you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about your powdery
mildew situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things we can spray and
things we can do to help treat and correct
[SPEAKER_02]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm mainly concerned with is why
is it there?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it show up in the first place?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it going to come back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you say you've sprayed fucking
everything, it makes me think that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have issues with the room, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is not enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not getting rid of the old air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not bringing in enough fresh air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly there are temperature
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things like that that
are going to be causing problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you running a hydro grow or a soil
grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's hydro, you've got a lot of water
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to control the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's hydro, you may need to get some
chillers and cool the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that'll prevent the water from
becoming a vapor, which becomes humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: which promotes the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running with rock wool cubes,
you may need to let them dry a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running soil, you may be getting
the soil too wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much water is in the grow facility
itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have water available to evaporate,
to make condensation in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to help you get powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much moisture, too much water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you're in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So too much moisture, too much water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The outside is hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inside is real moisture, creating a
bubble filled with humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to contribute to your
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need heavy dehumidification in that
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get that old hot, stale air
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get some fresh air in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you're treating the air that's
coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get that old stale air out,
of course, but there's fresh air coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fresh air coming in does need to be
treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they make a UV light that is very
good at killing powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will kill any spores that come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a light that goes over your
ducting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ducting, the intake ducting comes
in, and then this light shines through the
[SPEAKER_02]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything that passes through that
duct is basically killed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would use HIPAA filters on all of the
intakes, and I would use the UV lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: on all of the venting and ducting if you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can pass all of the air through one
thing and run a UV light over it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell things called clean lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are UV lights that are designed for
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're mostly used in like the strawberry
industry because strawberries get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell handheld versions of these
lights that you can actually walk around
[SPEAKER_02]: the crop and shine this light over the
entire crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just run it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just basically you want to illuminate
every inch of the canopy for about a half
[SPEAKER_02]: a second to two seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just wave your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waving my hand over it right now like
you guys can see what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's basically the same motion you
make when you're watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you just move your hand around,
blah, blah, blah, back and forth like a
[SPEAKER_02]: windshield wiper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do that with this light and you walk
over the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just make sure that the light shines
on every leaf and that light kills the
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes several applications of that
light to get rid of powdery mildew if you
[SPEAKER_02]: already have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're persistent with it,
that will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the room needs to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be some water issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need some equipment, some
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature control is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have huge swings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge temperature swings in the night and
in the day are going to cause powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I think about the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: How far apart are your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they touching if the plant leaves are
laying on top of each other in that little
[SPEAKER_02]: space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if we're sitting in a room and I
just put my hand on, this sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: disgusting to me, but what if I just put
my hand on your leg?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my hot hand, I'm 96 degrees or whatever
I am, my hand is just sitting on your leg.
[SPEAKER_02]: In about 20 or 30 minutes, there's going
to be a hot, sweaty spot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from our body parts touching and
getting warm, there's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of sweat in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sweat that those plants create will
cause powdery mildew right there between
[SPEAKER_02]: those two leaves, and it'll start
spreading from there rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something you can really help,
defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm in a large commercial facility,
we spend days just defoliating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'll be defoliation day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys get super stoned on your break
because when you come back, all you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is pulling leaves for the next eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pluck every leaf with a petiole out
of that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you're the manager,
if you're the boss, or if you're the
[SPEAKER_02]: owner, but if you are able to,
pull every leaf that you can out of there,
[SPEAKER_02]: those leaves are where the powdery mildew
happens, get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you can do for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread them out, kind of take off all the
big leaves, put some air on them,
[SPEAKER_02]: fan them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the powdery mildew can't develop
because it's blowing around too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can't develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the humidity doesn't stay stagnant,
the powdery mildew will have a harder time
[SPEAKER_02]: developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about, you said you've
sprayed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet your plants look pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got powdery mildew and you're
spraying them with stuff and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to fight the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're getting shit sprayed on
them frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet they're getting mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you're getting frustrated as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay positive, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to beat this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you've sprayed because
sometimes your sprays are going to add
[SPEAKER_02]: more moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to add more humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sprayed commercial rooms thinking,
yay, I just got rid of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came back the next day and the
powdery mildew was actually thicker,
[SPEAKER_02]: drove me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm saying, you got to fix the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to spread the plants apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a bunch of water on the
floor, squeegee and chop back that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: up, get rid of that extra water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you sprayed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a product called Big Time
Exterminator that I have heard works
[SPEAKER_02]: wonders on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's organic and it is, okay, here's
something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, we are very limited on
products that we can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people will say, go get a bottle
of Eagle 20 and spray that shit right on
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eagle 20 will get rid of your powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may take one application.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may take two applications, but your
powdery mildew will be gone for 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 45 to 60 days guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally do not like Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of deadly, dangerous,
shitty chemicals in there that we do not
[SPEAKER_02]: need to spray on our plants that we are
going to call medicine to give to sick
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not recommend Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, Eagle 20 is completely
banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not allowed to use it in a
recreational or a medical facility that is
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated by the Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a banned product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that some products are banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps us safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps our growers safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps the consumers safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done enough research on a lot
of these chemicals to know what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to us if we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these things affect your body in
a way that, say I spray my plants with
[SPEAKER_02]: Eagle 20 today and we let them flower,
we harvest them, we cut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably 50 to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let them dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably still Eagle 20 on those
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke it, I don't think I'm going
to notice anything right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may get a funky taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: My throat may burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that in like 10 years is when
I'm going to notice the fuck up from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a twitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: My left eye is going to pop out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get a limp or even a bigger fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it does something to my DNA or my
RNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't plan on having any more kids,
but maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll fuck up your RNA and your DNA
and your kids will come out with three
[SPEAKER_02]: arms or three eyes or one foot or 14 toes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know enough about what these
these chemicals kill mildews and they kill
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing something biologically or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what kind of chemical you're
using, but it's doing something and it
[SPEAKER_02]: could be getting into your body and
fucking up your body by smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I got way off topic, just kind of
on a rant there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to spray Eagle 20,
go on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit that shit with Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a little bit of time to figure out
how to fix the rooms and then hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: you can fix it again and not ever have to
use the Eagle 20 again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend that shit you guys at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that we are allowed to use in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: A product called Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's most like citrus oil or citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's citrus something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's citrus oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly citrus oil extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice lemony smell, orangey
smell, citrusy smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mixed that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I put whatever the bucket says.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ingredients on the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go the heavy route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix it up with some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray that right on the plants and that
stuff should calm down the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to go for a few applications
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll take care of your powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another product that I have seen work on
powdery mildew is 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a guy put 50 milliliters of hydrogen
peroxide in a five gallon bucket and
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayed that directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He adjusted the pH and then sprayed that
directly onto the entire crop and you
[SPEAKER_02]: could kind of see the hydrogen peroxide
break down the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sprayed the entire crop and then he
went ahead and sprayed the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprayed everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything smelled like hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled super clean in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took several applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was going at it daily,
but by the end of a week the powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use PM wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use ... Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say PM wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a product called PM wash,
which I haven't used it, but I've read
[SPEAKER_02]: great things about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PM wash should wash the powdery mildew
off of your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So peroxide, PM wash and Big Time
Exterminator are three products that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can order them over the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably buy them at your local
grow stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those products I'm told will get rid of
your powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen the hydrogen peroxide do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the Big Time Exterminator do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take multiple applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be persistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to need a little bit of love
after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to spray them for several
days with the product like Big Time
[SPEAKER_02]: Exterminator or hydrogen peroxide,
I recommend give them a day of rest and
[SPEAKER_02]: then spray them with push from our friends
at Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not pay me to talk about their
products, but push is an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a foliar product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little hard to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit expensive, but oh my
God, it's worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to do this much damage
and this much beating up to your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think push would be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another product I can recommend is a
product called stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stylet oil is not allowed to be used in a
recreational or a commercial facility in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, but I have used it myself and it
did take care of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stylet oil is an oil that coats your plant
and it will not allow the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not allow fungus gnats to gather
on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't let mites get on the bottom side
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wants anything to do with stylet
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with stylet oil is it strips
the cuticles off your plant leaves and it
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves them really vulnerable and they
look a little leathery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get kind of sad at you about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to use stylet oil,
if your plants are small enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would dunk the plants into a stylet oil,
dilute it heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go straight into the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, let me say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix up some stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot think of the dilution
recommendations, but it is on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dunk the plant into the stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get every leaf in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a good wiggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set it back in the grow area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn off the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it about an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let all the plants dry after you've dunked
everything and then go back with the
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayer and hose off every single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stylet oil will dry and coat and then
you just want to kind of rinse off the
[SPEAKER_02]: excess and all of your powdery mildew and
bugs should be removed within the first
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stylet oil will fuck your plants up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not strong, it's going to beat
the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe test a couple of plants because it
does beat your plants up heavily,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had almost forgotten about the stylet
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you located, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a huge bottle of JMS stylet oil
that I do not think I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're near me, we can work out a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fucking, I want to see what happens
when you use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, where am I now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that we can talk about,
our friend Frosty Organics was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast quite a while back and he talked
about lactic acid bacteria spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty taught us that he can make his own
lactic acid bacteria spray and apply it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says that one application will
remove his powdery mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how well that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not tried it myself, but I do trust
the shit out of Frosty Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to learn about lactic acid
bacteria and how to treat your cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants with it, you can Google lactic acid
bacteria and then powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there will be the word Clackamas
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clackamas is a city in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy named Clackamas Coot who is
from that part of Oregon who wrote an
[SPEAKER_02]: article about making lactic acid bacteria
to treat for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you Google it, it should not be too
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, something else I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: In professional horticultural applications
and environments, what is commonly used
[SPEAKER_02]: for powdery mildew is a product called
potassium bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available in several different forms
from what I read.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that it mixes up very much like a
baking soda in water and you apply that to
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants as a foliar spray and that
disrupts the pH on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf, which will get rid of your powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a horticultural standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what they use in large greenhouses
for large production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So potassium bicarbonate, from what I
read, it comes in a very powdery form
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like baking soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's available in other forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's something that'll help you
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a commercial grow,
I'm not sure if that will be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you check out all of the
laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything I say needs to be researched
before you apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that people are going to
recommend for you for your powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: issue, people are going to say to hang a
sulfur burner in the grow and run the
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur burner for an hour or 45 minutes
every few hours or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to have their own recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly advise against this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I do not like a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not call them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in a very, very well known
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a very well known breeder working
with them who actually left and started
[SPEAKER_02]: his own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That facility was having a powdery mildew
issue and their solution was to run a
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: The results were for about six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you would shop at that
dispensary, everything would have,
[SPEAKER_02]: at first it was a flavor of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would smoke it and you'd be like,
why does this taste weird?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was sulfury.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once somebody would say, I think there's a
sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brain would go, oh yeah, that totally
tastes like sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really strong at first and over
a few months it faded out, but you could
[SPEAKER_02]: taste it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've gotten rid of the sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've corrected their problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it doesn't happen, but that's why you
don't run a sulfur burner in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will make your plants taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't do the sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that you can do that may help
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you're using mother plants
or if you're taking plants, taking cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: from your vegging plants or how that
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you were taking clones,
I recommend dunking them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut my clone from the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put them in a cup with water and a small
bit of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I carry that cup filled with
cuttings to another area where they are
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmed up and then they are dunked into a
solution and then they are dipped and then
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck into either the cloner if I'm
working at one facility or they're put
[SPEAKER_02]: into plugs if I'm at another facility or
they're put in a rock wall at another
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on where I'm working and
who I'm working with, what I got going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after the cut, I like to dunk the
freshly cut clone and trimmed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut off the leaves, you trim off all
the extra, then I dunk that right into
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will change my product up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I use Vanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I will use the, what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I wrote down BTE and I can
always forget that that stands for big
[SPEAKER_02]: time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll mix up the hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just depends on what's available and what
I'm treating for, what I think I may be at
[SPEAKER_02]: risk for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that powdery mildew is the
problem here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mix up a little bit of hydrogen
peroxide in your water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use a five gallon bucket and
anywhere between 30 and 70 mils of
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrogen peroxide usually seems to work
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the clone, dunk that right into the
five gallon bucket of hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_02]: give it a nice hefty shake and then put
that into the dip and grow or the clone X
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever you were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever the hell we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then stick that right into the cloner,
whatever I'm going into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know that I killed all of the
powdery mildew so that I've got a fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: start so that that clone can root and have
a healthy start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as it roots and it gets put
into its first pot, I'll spray it with
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every, I'll spray it once a week
with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I see powdery mildew or here's
a, here's a hint.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit before powdery mildew starts,
you will see the little tiny bumps pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaf may start to just get a little
bit bumpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to, it just looks
like a little pimple or a war or something
[SPEAKER_02]: funky coming up on the leaf, but it's real
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you start seeing that, then it's
time to start treating for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: extra strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out your UV clean light, get out your
hydrogen peroxide, get out the PM wash,
[SPEAKER_02]: the big time exterminator, the lactic acid
bacteria, the potassium bicarbonate,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out there, start treating those
plants because you're going to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I see that, that's when I start
stepping up my game, going a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing I should mention is the
powdery mildew could be on your clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're carrying it around from the flower
room to the veg room, to the mother room,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the clone room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your air conditioning ducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your HVAC system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got those silly ducts that have
the insulation inside of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: tear that shit out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that could be a multi-thousand
dollar job for your facility, but all of
[SPEAKER_02]: that insulation inside of there is
harboring, harboring.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a hard word to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The insulation is harboring powdery mildew
and it will eventually be a place for bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: to hide out once one gets in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just takes two and those bugs will start a
party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have the powdery mildew on your
clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure everybody's changing clothes
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you've got a grower that has a
private grow at home and he's got powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as he starts getting rid of
powdery mildew, you get it worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as your facility starts
getting it cleaned up, he gets it worse
[SPEAKER_02]: and you guys are just passing that shit
back and forth and it's never going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So start changing your clothes,
get some dedicated clothes, dedicated
[SPEAKER_02]: shoes, a dedicated hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got long hair or dreadlocks,
get it wrapped up, get it in a hat,
[SPEAKER_02]: get it covered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm always going and retucking
my dreads because I try to keep everything
[SPEAKER_02]: covered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want dragging my dreads along
around the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to be picking up bugs or
leaving a hair in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep your dreads and your hair
covered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a big man wook beard or if
you've got a hipster beard, cover that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try to be clean, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I really want to recommend,
I did work in a facility that was riddled
[SPEAKER_02]: with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't call them out on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my friends and listeners know who
the fuck I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place was riddled with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fired a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in and I said, well, you've got
bugs and powdery mildew to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yes, we do help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to get rid of it, you guys,
but being MED regulated, I understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: struggle that my listener here has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in that grow got sick because of
the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mildew is gone, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took two or three crops, two or three
crop cycles to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the powdery mildew was actually gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got rid of it in a hundred light
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PM was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could not see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could not smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could not taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody kind of got like a sinus
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody showed different symptoms,
but everybody could agree that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: messing up their noses, their throat,
and their eye region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a ventilator, a respirator,
or even one of those just shitty little
[SPEAKER_02]: paper Asian bird flu masks, just wear one
of those when you're working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew because you don't want to
get sick from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to deny that I was sick from the
powdery mildew, but once it was gone,
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could tell that my allergy problem
and my throat thing was happening because
[SPEAKER_02]: of that powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the plants are bad powdery mildewy,
you have to think about if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: release that product to the public because
you don't want to be responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: making people sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a moral thing you're going to
have to think about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that they do allow here in
Colorado, they will let you blast the
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The marijuana enforcement division has
decided that it is safe to put powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew buds and trim into a tube and run
butane over it and turn it into a BHO,
[SPEAKER_02]: hash, dabs, shatter, wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns into distillate eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets put into edibles eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they're deeming it safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's what you want to do with it,
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best I can recommend with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, if it's coated in powdery
mildew, think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Doug is getting old and Doug's
got a lung problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Doug smokes regular cannabis,
he coughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Doug smokes cannabis that's got
something on it, he coughs a lot and gets
[SPEAKER_02]: really sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug is smoking because he's sick and
trying to prolong and save his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not want to give Doug powdery
mildews and mycotoxins and funky shit for
[SPEAKER_02]: his lungs to kill him more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking want him here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treat everybody like Doug.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that's getting cannabis is my
friend Doug in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have to take care of all of our
patients like they are Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug is a real dude, but I kind of
exaggerated his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug's not that sick, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to use him as an example
because he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I've given you some information
that kind of teaches you how to at least
[SPEAKER_02]: control and harness and get rid of this
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what you can do where you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can spray in
[SPEAKER_02]: any of these products that you choose to
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to throw away some plants
if they're starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an episode coming up about
seasonal effectiveness disorder or
[SPEAKER_02]: seasonal effective disorder since it has
been winter time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk a little bit about that
because I've got a bunch of great stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it has been listener inspired
material, which I truly enjoy bringing to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.

[SPEAKER_02]: They came to Colorado to visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They invited me up.

[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Matty and Spence,

[SPEAKER_07]: And my tunes were played on
[SPEAKER_07]: the music.
[SPEAKER_07]: But
[SPEAKER_07]: you were your own.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a hand made down,
[SPEAKER_07]: broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps they're better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them
[SPEAKER_07]: don't really care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let there be songs.
[SPEAKER_07]: To fill the air.
[SPEAKER_07]: When there is no.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your cup is full.
[SPEAKER_07]: May it be again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let it be known.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a road.
Night
[SPEAKER_07]: and if you go
[SPEAKER_07]: your steps alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: When there is
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a fountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not by the hands of man.
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you've got problems like that,
if you're thinking about starting to drink
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol, or take pills, or hurt yourself,
or cut yourself, or break something,
[SPEAKER_02]: or be an asshole to people, please get
some help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to judge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to hate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to treat you right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to hurt yourself, if you want
to kill yourself, please call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking send me a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call Suicide Prevention Hotline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably don't know each other too
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're embarrassed to call somebody,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't broadcast your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about why you want to hurt
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll fix that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't need to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really depressed, please get
some help.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think you've got some winter
seasonal depression, we can help you with
[SPEAKER_02]: some cannabis suggestions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another symptom here would be some
laziness, just low energy, lethargy,
[SPEAKER_02]: no desire to get out of bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to lay around, put some
blankets over you, maybe play on your
[SPEAKER_02]: phone and not do a damn thing,
losing interest in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an effect of the winter depression
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have no desire to eat when
this winter depression comes on,
[SPEAKER_02]: but oddly enough, the internet says that
people will seek foods like carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_02]: and such during the winter, which is odd
for me because I always like carbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like pizza and pasta and shit,
but it says that you're going to seek out
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrate type salty foods if you are
experiencing seasonal effectiveness
[SPEAKER_02]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says you're going to be agitated and
irritable, which I am there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's partly how I'm noticing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel more tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel grouchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel fucking annoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that it's mostly just this
seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that the internet said that
I totally relate to, and this is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what inspired me to want to talk about
this because it's part of where we are in
[SPEAKER_02]: this new generation, this new part of
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that this seasonal effectiveness
disorder comes with panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a reason for these panic
attacks that we're getting now as humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are too attached to our computers and
our devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: As humans, we have become completely lazy
and complacent.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the winter, I think that there's
something inside of me that gives me this
[SPEAKER_02]: trigger to go hunt and gather food and
build a fire so that I can keep the family
[SPEAKER_02]: warm through the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us have jobs that don't require
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in a grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I show up at a grow at six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave there at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play on my computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: My food all comes from a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as humans, we were designed
and built to be out there hunting our
[SPEAKER_02]: food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be out there chasing down deer or
buffalo and killing that shit and dragging
[SPEAKER_02]: it in and then scanning it and cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am a vegetarian and I'm saying
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of why I think humans are
fucked up because we're not doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something primal in us that makes
us supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the winter, that primal instinct to
survive becomes even stronger because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: harder to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the environment where I am,
it's even harder because it snows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that I'm in the worst
conditions, but we get snow and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have shelter and food and
warmth, you will die out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our instinct, our natural design is to be
hunting and gathering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to be using energy and
adrenaline and that anger that you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't feel that if you were
throwing a spear at another animal so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have time to be angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have time to be depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be letting out all that anger through
adrenaline, through hiking, through
[SPEAKER_02]: stalking an animal, or maybe through
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were a vegetarian back in the
whatever times I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you had to spend all of that energy
in the garden and we're not doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting on computers and we're
playing video games and we're driving up
[SPEAKER_02]: to a window to get our food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of that is kind of what's
causing the winter depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of the males, I'm not sure if
this affects women the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to be sexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know it's a testosterone thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe women want to be hunters and
gatherers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, maybe women suffer the seasonal
effectiveness disorder for the same
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, but differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure this part is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The panic attacks and the hunting rant is
all my own opinion here, but I think we
[SPEAKER_02]: should be using our energy and I'm going
to start talking about now about things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can do to help ourselves with this
seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already talked about being active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out there and do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hypothetically saying I feel like we
should be hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be chasing down an elk or a
deer, and then we got to kill it with
[SPEAKER_02]: either a spear or a bow and arrow,
a recurve bow, and you got to go drag that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit back to camp and then you got to skin
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get everything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being around a fire makes me feel
really good, like a campfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something inside of a campfire really
fixes me, especially in this cold weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out there and be active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build a campfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go camping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go hunting if you're that type of person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I can really recommend to get
you out of a seasonal effective disorder
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a funk is join some sort of
organized martial art or fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of what's causing this is
pent up body energy from the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out there and use your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go join a Brazilian jujitsu class.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go join a martial arts class.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go be a wrestler.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not into that, go do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do some yoga.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use some energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll really help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get to smoking cannabis,
I want to say go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put on some music and go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always fixes my head when I'm a
little bit funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on your favorite music, some reggae,
whatever you're into.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into some metal, put on some
metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it up a little bit too loud and just
go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll fix your head, but I wanted to say
go for a drive before I start talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about consuming cannabis because Mike will
flip out if I say smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how cannabis can truly help with
the seasonal effectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that smoking sativa dominant
cannabis, either flowers or dabs,
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to help fix your mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a short list of strains here that
I have experimented with personally that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have found to help uplift my mood and not
make me too anxious or jittery and still
[SPEAKER_02]: allow me to function and get my job done
and still be like a normal person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would still have a nice buzz and nobody
could tell how high I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this list, number one on this list
is Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jilly Bean has always put me in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me walk with a nice little pep in
my step.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts a grin on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jilly Bean will wipe out any anxiety,
depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll calm me down and put you in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one on that list is Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a lot of people are going to say
Jilly Bean and Tangy are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very similar strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very similar qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They taste very similarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow similarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they both put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next strain on my list is Tangerine
Haze from Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually Soma's New York City
Diesel, but there's a phenotype that
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes very tangerine and orangey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Tangerine Haze has always been,
I used to call it my morning breakfast
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, I need my morning oranges and
I would smoke some Soma's Tangerine Haze
[SPEAKER_02]: or was New York City Diesel known as
Tangerine Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a group back in the day known
as the Devil's Harvest Crew and they grew
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of stuff and they found a very
orangey phenotype, very orangey phenotype
[SPEAKER_02]: of the New York City Soma's Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They passed that around and called it
Tangerine Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it got the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the same phenotype out of a pack
and I grew it and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always used to put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those top three that I listed are
very orangey, very citrusy, very sativa,
[SPEAKER_02]: yet very light strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you smoke them, when I smoke them,
I don't get super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get high as fuck off of either of
those three strains, but I can catch a
[SPEAKER_02]: really killer smiley buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something in that orange turp is really
helping you fix your mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next strain on my list you guys is
Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Brothers Grimm Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy 99 has always given me a nice smiley
cerebral uplifting buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a mood changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you a little shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's available again in seed form
from our friends at Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can possibly pick that up at
TheDankTeam.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that's always uplifting and
puts me in a good mood, but is sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: too much for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one may give you a little panicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a little jittery and too much
sativa, this may be a little too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the Jack Herr has always been a good
strain for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes my mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps me upbeat and it makes me social,
but it can drive your head a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're somebody that gets too talkative
when you smoke too much cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack may not be the cross for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to get social, if you're going
somewhere and you're like, I got to go
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to people, maybe some Jack will be
the one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another strain that is always uplifting
and puts people in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to be surprised that I
say this because I've made plenty of jokes
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, but Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream is always a good strain for
putting you in a good mood, for changing
[SPEAKER_02]: your vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one of those strains that makes
you want to curl up into a ball when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get too high because I've seen people want
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get too high from Blue Dream and
it's a nice mellow buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I make fun of Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it stripper weed because that's how
high strippers want to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strippers don't want to get high as fuck
like I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strippers just want to get a little buzz
and go spin on the pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking, but that's why I call it
stripper weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically any kind of a Hayes cross,
you guys, most of what I've mentioned has
[SPEAKER_02]: a Hayes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herr and Jack the Ripper have a lot
of the same parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack the Ripper is a cross of Jack Herr.
[SPEAKER_02]: I strongly recommend some Jack the Ripper,
but like I said about the Herr,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be a bit much for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could make some people's head spin.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not an experienced smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trying to beat seasonal
effectiveness disorder and you are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a strong heavy sativa dose and you
like to get kind of whirlwind high,
[SPEAKER_02]: grab yourself some Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available at a lot of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great tasting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a great high to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's usually pretty easy to find
because Subcool is a very popular breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're talking about Subcool,
I'm going to mention Vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get some Vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wax, but it was kind of,
it was a different type.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a texture of wax from a dispensary
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved the high from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me, it gave me tunnel vision high
to where I couldn't pay attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: anything except what was right in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also put the stupidest smile on my
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really loved the way that Vortex made me
feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Vortex, if you are not an
experienced, Vortex made my heart race.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me, my heart was going,
but I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about being too high
like that, that I really, really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another strain that is good for the
seasonal affective disorder is the lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's golden goat cross two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually lemon skunk crossed a golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of my favorites to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been tested in the 30% range for
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely a head changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about the orange and lemon
terps, the limonene terps really create
[SPEAKER_02]: like a good mood, a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think things that smell like oranges,
smell like fruit, smell like lemons are
[SPEAKER_02]: usually going to be uplifting,
positive vibe kind of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of the haze crosses and the
tangy and jelly bean crosses are usually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be good to put you into a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are strains that I can recommend
for smoking if they are available where
[SPEAKER_02]: you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If smoking isn't something for you,
and if you're not getting the desired
[SPEAKER_02]: effect from smoking, edibles may be a
better route to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Body chemistry is all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trying to fight depression or
seasonal affective depression,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you need high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you need CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would kind of stay away from the
indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens to me, and I have to go in
history because now I smoke so much and my
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance is so high and I'm older and I'm
more used to being high out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was younger and was new at
cannabis, when I would smoke sativas,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get that real psychedelic high and
get talkative sort of like I am now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just fucking rambling and talking
about everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when I would smoke indicas,
I would go in my head and get quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you just sit in a chair and
you start thinking too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you could drive yourself crazy
thinking too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're already in the seasonal
affectiveness disorder kind of head state,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking an indica that's going to put you
into your own head and make you think may
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck you up a little more than you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause more depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause self-doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be the thing that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would go for some sativa edibles or
CBD edibles, but I would definitely stay
[SPEAKER_02]: away from the indica dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I think the most reliable cure
for seasonal affective disorder is to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a joint and go for a hike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a nice safe hiking spot, roll
yourself up a nice joint of your favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, either the jilly bean or some
lemon jeffery or whatever you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: that fits in the list that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself a nice sativa joint,
roll it up, take one of your best friends
[SPEAKER_02]: with you, take your dog with you,
get a bottle of water, go for a walk,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a joint and fix your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, you guys, it's okay to
feel this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to deal with some shit
in their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right to feel kind of funky once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to deal with it properly and pull
yourself through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully when the spring comes,
you'll start cheering up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully by the time 420 rolls around,
you'll be in a good mood and then summer's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back and then it's time to get in a
good mood again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can figure it out and not go
through it again next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, that was my quick
talk on seasonal affectiveness disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I was helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I could guide you in the right way
to select cannabis to keep you in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, even if you're not suffering through
some seasonal depression, all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains will probably put a smile on your
face, keep you social.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to go to lunch with somebody
you don't really care to go to lunch with,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got to do a chore you don't
really give a shit to do, try smoking one
[SPEAKER_02]: of these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might put you in a better mood for
doing it.
