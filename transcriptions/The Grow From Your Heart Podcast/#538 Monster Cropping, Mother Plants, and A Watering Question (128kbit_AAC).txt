[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is time for episode 538 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of the show was brought to
you by our friends at seeds here now.com
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds here now.com offers seeds from all
of the industry's favorite breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: including miss Jill genetics, Duke
diamond, and of course, I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything at seeds here now.com is backed
by their award winning satisfaction
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my friends on a tight budget seeds
here now.com offers several packs for
[SPEAKER_01]: under $30 as well as a coupon code G F Y H
10 while checking out to save a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that is coupon code G F Y H 10
while checking out at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been taking dabs of lush cherry full
spectrum extract from green dot labs on
[SPEAKER_01]: the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says this is a blend of copper Kim and
cherry Kush mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor is described as leather,
cherry and gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I crack it open, it smells like a
cherry Ludens cough drop plus a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I hit it, that's when the
leather kicks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the flavor settles on the tongue,
you get the cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a little bit later, that's when the
gas kicks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget the show is now available on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to spill that big jar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a four gram jar filled with chunky
diamonds and lots of sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really got close to dumping that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure you check out the show on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the YouTube channel and please
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click the little bell, turn on the

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I think that covers all of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a quick mic check.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does appear that everything is working
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into the email portion of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an email right here in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a cannabis culture or a
cannabis cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to turn up these headphones
just to touch and keep on recording and
[SPEAKER_01]: not even edit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I heard the boost and it feels better.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, the first email in today's
episode goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rasta Jeff, thank you for years of
archived podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you for noticing that there are
530 something episodes up and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing that they're all
archived on that YouTube channel and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Apple podcast feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, I've been growing for
almost a year now and your grow talks are
[SPEAKER_01]: a complete must and you throw off nuggets
of wisdom on almost every show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some shows I know that I do get a little
rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little stony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little spacey, but I do try to
have at least one golden nugget in every
[SPEAKER_01]: episode though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for noticing that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, I cannot keep mother
plants because of plant count limits,
[SPEAKER_01]: also because of time and the expense and
space of keeping extra plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand that struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of my count is dedicated to keeping
mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say thank you for your
cloning episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an almost 100% success rate with
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are very, very welcome for the cloning
episode and I'm excited to hear that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having 100% success.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I'm doing a perpetual grow now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three tents of varying sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like where this is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two tents for a flower and a
smaller tent for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put veg plants into my flowering
tents the day after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That keeps everything right on schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut down, you clean up, you move more
plants in, never miss a day, keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says when I cut clones prior to flip,
they veg for too long and they start to
[SPEAKER_01]: get too big for my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I cloned two to three weeks into
flower, however, the plants would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect size for transfer into their
flowering tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will allow me to keep three
separate lines of genetics without keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does make great sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few caveats to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This listener who has chimed in a few
times, big shout out to our friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Stephen, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This listener has a very good idea for a
perpetual grow and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize their space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does make sense that when they take
clones, they've got to wait nine full
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks of flower or however many weeks
they're flowering plus veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to wait a long time until
those plants are ready to move into their
[SPEAKER_01]: next space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting a little bit bigger than
desired.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're outgrowing their space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy has found out, this listener,
St. Stephen has found out that if they
[SPEAKER_01]: were to cut the clones about 14 to 21 days
later, they would be the perfect size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is now the plants are in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what it goes on to say that
they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not experienced enough to sift through
the bullshit on grow forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they send me a link where cloning
from flower is discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The poster is very enthusiastic about the
strategy, your grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you would rather not
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long your genetics are
going to last before something starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gone over the phenomenon known.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the phenomenon known as before?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've programmed my brain genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't talk about genetic drift anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have identified that as regenerative
mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, what may happen is
senescence may trigger be in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant, you are reproducing the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if senescence is going to
kick in eventually in your clone stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if, since you're taking them
from flowering plants, the hormones have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am much more comfortable taking clones
from non-flowering plants because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got vegetative hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are flowering a plant, cloning it,
kind of reverting it to veg, flowering it
[SPEAKER_01]: again, then taking a clone from that,
then treating that clone to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: torture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that over time, this may cause a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I don't have any science to back
that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just my, that's me going,
Ooh, that sounds kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like you may lose something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some vigor, something, some resistance,
something may go wrong after that many,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, that many clonings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we don't talk about the
regenerative mutation isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cloning well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we do clone in a bad environment,
if we make mistakes, if we get a disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we get a pest, that's when things can
all start going downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll pass on in the cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work for you, but I wonder
how long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to do your experiment,
but don't fall too in love with these
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars because they may over time
decide to just do something weird on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start seeing the vigor slow
down, when you start seeing something
[SPEAKER_01]: different happen and you're doing the same
thing, that may be a sign that these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants have just done the clone process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to revedge and then
flower again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of work for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of stress for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only supposed to be an annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think your system will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, my only concern is for how long
I don't know what is in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may tell the plant, Hey, we've been
doing this for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just fucking give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep mother plants around for a
really long time, but again, I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering them and then trying to revert
them and then flower them again and then
[SPEAKER_01]: clone them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of steps of stress that
I'm skipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I don't know how long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know you sent me this a little
while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how things are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep me updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let me know how the plants look.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the mother plants or the clones have
changed anything, if they're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: act differently from so much stress and so
many hormonal changes, they may start to
[SPEAKER_01]: get weird on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've said the same thing over
and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the microphone adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earphones sound good now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thanks for listening to a subpar
intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did not sound up to my standards,
but we're going to keep moving because we
[SPEAKER_01]: got the video going, trying to kick some
ass today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey St. Stephen, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been around for a long time and I
do look forward to an update in the very
[SPEAKER_01]: near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message came from a listener who
supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not supporting the show,
once again, make sure you do that at
[SPEAKER_01]: patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart or follow the link in the video
[SPEAKER_01]: description or in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message comes from EZ057.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up EZ057?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what that 057 means, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a pager in the nineties also,
but it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, when you decide to keep a mother
plant, do you ever top, pop, crack,
[SPEAKER_01]: twist, or just let it grow naturally?
[SPEAKER_01]: In your experience, how long does it take
a plant like lemon Jeffrey to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, that's a separate question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I pop, twist, top, and manipulate my
mother plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely top them because I want to
take out that main apical top so I can get
[SPEAKER_01]: several tops so that when I go to clone,
I've got a bunch of tops competing to be
[SPEAKER_01]: that main top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clone from the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people will tell you clone the
bottom, I clone from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those big main fat, healthy tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a lot of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very limited by our numbers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in a commercial environment,
I clone from the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I top that main middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a bushy plant that's
coming up, you got one coming right out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a couple of branches that
meet the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to compete and become the
new apical tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time I need clones, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four branches below those,
they grow right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got four clones next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do top my mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do much popping, cracking,
or twisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need big robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aren't really high-performance
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are donor plants that are there to
give me clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just get fed a very balanced,
vegetative diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to give them a lot of light to keep
them short and squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a lot of topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a lot of trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a lot of pruning, but not a lot
of excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: The popping, cracking, and twisting is for
a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's to make bigger, stronger stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want bigger, fatter plants when I'm
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really need that from the veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to make buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just making me clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need them recovering all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need them growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cracking and twisting also is to slow
down vertical growth in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys aren't being triggered to
flower, so they're not going to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: 21-day stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not concerned with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not doing that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the next part is, in your experience,
how long does it take a plant like Lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffery to go from 20 to 30% perfect
trichome to overripe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I go into that 48 to 72-hour
darkness right when I get 20 to 30% and
[SPEAKER_01]: then harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the information, high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the new Instagram live feeds and
the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, EZ057, thank you for watching the
Instagram live videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are not already watching,
every Monday around 7, 10 PM Mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: Time, I go on Instagram live and I do
something similar to this, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let you guys ask me the questions in the
live feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my best to answer your questions
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll like what we're doing there
and you're very welcome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're enjoying the Instagram
videos and the new YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not watching the video,
please go watch the video on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you will enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get to the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long could it take for those trichomes
to go from 20 to 30%, which you find
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect to overripe?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to depend on your
environment and your conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little colder environment, it will take
longer for things to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warmer environment, it's going to go more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hotter environment, it will happen more
rapidly, more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will happen sooner, more dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to depend on your environment
and your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That window is somewhere between three,
five, and seven days is when you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see major changes when you go,
hey, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should cut it to, ah, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's ready, you're asking if you can
throw it into that 48 to 72 hour darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say go 24 to 48.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say instead of 48 to 72,
go 24 to 48 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what your goal is with the
dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some get a little more density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what your approach is,
but just reduce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go to 48 if you think it's overripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were waiting for a message,
how long ago did you send this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a date on this Patreon
message, but hopefully you've harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say the time where it could go
from perfectly ripe to, oh, that's getting
[SPEAKER_01]: close.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about a, I don't know, like you'll
see, you'll see, you'll go, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be ripe tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that day, you probably got three days
before you start seeing a major
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five days, you're going to go,
oh shit, we got 45 to 50% milky and amber
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then like seven to 10 days, that's when
you're going to go, ah, man, I really
[SPEAKER_01]: should have cut that down like a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the timeframe's closer to three day
little increments instead of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh shit, yesterday would have been the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really that tight of a timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to say a three to five day
window when you're going to watch things
[SPEAKER_01]: really make a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven to 10 days is when you're really
going to see drastic changes and have
[SPEAKER_01]: regrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about why you're doing the 48 to 72
hour darkness window.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of reasons why people
think they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if that's right for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if it's right for your environment and
right for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe defoliate before you do that,
because you do give the option for
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with all that foliage and that
moisture there in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from our friend, easy057.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had a very successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, how long does it take a plant
like lemon, Jeffrey?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to hope that was hypothetical
and that I did not take too long to answer
[SPEAKER_01]: your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing a quick mic check.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys on camera saw me look over and
make sure shit is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something didn't sound perfect at the
beginning of the show, but I think I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you do care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You care about this next message.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from Patreon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from our friend Rasta K.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Rasta K.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is good to see you all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta K is on the DGC, a dude grows crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta K is also on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Rasta K on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got Rasta K showing up on
the podcast and in Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read Rasta K's message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been a big fan of the show for the
past year and a half, and I'm finally able
[SPEAKER_01]: to become a Patreon contributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No stress that it took you a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are out there that cannot
contribute at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I am now a supporter of this
podcast as well as the DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friends at the dude
grows show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like my show, I think you would
really appreciate the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were gracious enough to invite me on
a live grow talk a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on their YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump to the whole DGC gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big friends of mine, nothing but love and
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes on to say I've told many guys
about this show and especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: watering tech one through five.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys a while back, I did an episode
called one through five watering tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give a very detailed description about
watering cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like that episode worked very
well for Rasta K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for telling people about the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for learning and absorbing
some information from that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to blame it on the lush cherry
dabs, but it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I'm a cocoa grower and I have been
since starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy's always been growing cocoa or
this listener has always been growing with
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I use bio biz cocoa, four buffered
and rinsed and we'll add perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using 80% cocoa, 20% perlite,
and a few handfuls of rice holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a good mix so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in three gallon radical bags in a four
by four by eight tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an Arise and a Rockbud,
Rockbird auto and a two by two is I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting to see the sex of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I hope you get a good male to
female ratio there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it goes on to say my question is when
watering cocoa, do you prefer to let it
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out to what I would say a two and then
water to feed to runoff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watering my girls every other
day, one and a half gallons of water and
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes off to 15 to 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be fine and growing great,
but I'm hearing and seeing other places
[SPEAKER_01]: that letting cocoa dry out will mess the
pH up and have it fluctuating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, should I change something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I fix some shit that ain't broken?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, it is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're doing a wonderful
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were watering on a schedule that works
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have let the internet infect your
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have heard something that you think
would be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to try that,
try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My answer is the plants are always the
boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the cocoa gets to number two dryness
and the plants, the leaves haven't drooped
[SPEAKER_01]: down and look pissed off, let it get to a
one and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it gets to a one and it's real
droopy, that's when the plants are angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to find that 1.9 balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it get to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it get to 1.9 right below a two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my grow advice is really from
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the grow equipment you can buy is
really programmed for ideal parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants know exactly what the plants
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you met me, you know that I like dabs
and kombucha, but you also may not know
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't like pineapple kombuchas
because they taste like fucking sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're subtle things you've got to
learn and you've got to experience to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch on to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants are telling you number two
is the sweet spot for you to water me,
[SPEAKER_01]: go for a number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a number three is where they got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds weird talking about doing a
number two and a number three so much now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the plants tell you number three is
when to water me, go by the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let the equipment, don't let me,
don't let the internet infect your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the plants be the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a slave to those fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them make all of the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: As to pH fluctuating in the cocoa,
that is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dryness and moisture are going to cause pH
fluctuations in the cocoa, but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very slight fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find them to be beneficial because
we absorb and absorb different nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: at different pH levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it starts off low and goes higher,
starts off high and goes low, you just
[SPEAKER_01]: gave yourself a window to absorb more of
those nutrients that were left around in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not that big of a deal to get a
little bit of a swing in your medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stress too much over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it ain't broke, don't fix it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like your grow is doing
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting 15 to 20% runoff and you
said they seem to be fine and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: great, but I'm hearing and seeing other
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let that infect your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what is great for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to experiment, I encourage
it, but don't let infections of the brain
[SPEAKER_01]: mess up your steady success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, no, I use advanced nutrients,
perfect sensei for cocoa, which balances
[SPEAKER_01]: my pH to 6.0 in my feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't add pH up or pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there are some nutrients that if
you mix them, to the appropriate ratios,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you put a five gallon bucket and put in
this much of product A, this much of B and
[SPEAKER_01]: this much of these additives, the pH will
always balance itself to 6.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really cool trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not wanting to do the pH step,
that really helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still check it even with pH perfect
nutrients, just because I'm paranoid and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to write it down anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is what this person is saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, am I cutting myself
short by not feeding every day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason I let it dry out is because
of fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, am I cutting myself
short by not feeding my plants every day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look like they're getting
underfed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look like they have a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't show any yellowing,
if you don't have a Cal Mag deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: if the veins down the middle of the leaves
aren't getting pale, if you don't get like
[SPEAKER_01]: light coloring or anything, if the new
growth doesn't look sad, if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting any problems, you're probably
doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stress over feeding them too
frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, you could hit them with a
light feed at the end of the day or right
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point when you think they're too
dry, but then you have to reschedule all
[SPEAKER_01]: of your feedings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've got it going right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you don't need to fuck up
what you've already got dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'm the guy that loves to
experiment, but you've got another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you keep it dry because of fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good reason to keep it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good reason to not increase
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no problem with what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to bring fungus gnats
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps going though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I added EWC to my last batch of
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will never do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was watering every day and having
the media moist, I would get fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_01]: and larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one fungus gnats and then you've
got all the fungus gnats and they're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I used amazing doctor enzymes and
got rid of the larvae and was told to let
[SPEAKER_01]: the media dry completely out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from Scotty of the DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let the media, if you use the,
what did you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctor enzyme?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those enzymes will get in there and
eat the larvae and make those fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_01]: not want to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you let it dry out,
they don't want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want warm and moist environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where they thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fucking desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go find some more moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friend Scotty Real
for giving you good grow advice,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy some recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, since the gnats are
gone, should I start feeding every day
[SPEAKER_01]: again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't do too much with auto
flowers, but I'm hoping you can shed some
[SPEAKER_01]: light on watering cocoa and battling
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't mess with auto flowers,
but I think soil and soil problems and
[SPEAKER_01]: watering are the same story here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants just went into flower on their
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only real difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants want water every day,
water them every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants do not want water every day,
don't water them every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find what the plants like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had better advice for you,
but the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are going to pay the paycheck
in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me, not you, not the lights,
not the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are going to tell you if they
want more water, if they want more food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound like a very intelligent and
rational thinking person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about soak one of those plants the
fuck down the next day?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably got multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't tell me how many.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's none of my business how many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pick a plant and fucking just soak it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens if you water that one
plant every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you overwater it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may get angry at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the best way to find out,
but just pick one, mark it, water that
[SPEAKER_01]: fucker too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm really not your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the honest answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the doctor enzyme worked, I would say
continue using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can use things with bacillus
thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is how it's pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's BT.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many products that have that in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think that the spinosad may work
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to want to do a soil
drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix that up in some water, water through
the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let all that pesticide get in there and
kill those fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want the BT or spinosad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think are going to work well for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: An evergreen drench would also do it,
but that's a little more, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more brutal on the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have really healthy
plants, that is not something I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thank you so much, brother,
for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a minute, check out my IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ross Dekay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I may be following you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I'm following you on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm not now, I will be by the time
this episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks, big respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, I started growing maybe 14 gram
plants and with the help of the DGC and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
I now grow autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give me four to six ounces per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that is quite an increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went from 14 grams to four to six
ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't even do the math on that that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: You four timed it, maybe five or six timed
your production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the fuck I'm saying
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went from a half ounce to six of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good fucking increase,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we were able to help you on the
path of success and improving your garden.

please do send me another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how the plants are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you've decided to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they need more water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they doing okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are the fungus nets?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get rid of them fuckers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll help you get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does say you can use my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ross Dekay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay ire brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got the hang loose emoji,
big hang loose emoji.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to you, Ross Dekay.
