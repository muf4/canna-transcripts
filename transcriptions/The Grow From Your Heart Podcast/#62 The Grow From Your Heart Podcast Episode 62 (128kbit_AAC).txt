[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: See us every Thursday at the Rainbow for
the Wild Cousins comedy open mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in Pueblo on Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then April 7th, we have a show also at
the Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For $5, you can see Mary Mack,
who has been on a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been on Last Comic Standing and a
bunch of different comedy festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently she did a voice on Aquatine
Hunger Force.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was she on Aquatine, do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was she Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that time they had Rush on there,
she played Geddy Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's April 7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's coming with her husband,
who has been on Letterman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spacing the name right now,
but you should just come check it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: come check us out every Thursday at the
Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this will come out the day before
that, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this will come out the 6th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at my phone right now trying
to find the calendar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the 7th, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening to this on the 6th,
go to the Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend who thought that was in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They drove to Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up?
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked for the Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they realized that it's in Pueblo,
so they drove back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time they got there,
I think they missed your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really nice room, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedians get free pizza and a free drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what qualifies me as a comedian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I get up and tell a joke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just get up there and tell a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come do open mic night at the Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a free beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a free beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have my free beer if I go get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I don't need the beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, now you're drinking again,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold does not drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two men in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three men in the room that don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol does not agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allergic to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I break out in handcuffs and fat chicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get really angry, and I say stuff
that I don't mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do that sober, so I don't know if
that's alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just multiplies with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just gives it another level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes it all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we go too far, I should do the
commercials because we're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into this conversation, I can already
tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge, huge shout out to Bern and Jesse and
the entire crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: LaDonna, I'm not going to skip you,

dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw an ad today that they had hortilux
bulbs on sale for a ridiculous price.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were $69.99 for a thousand
watt hortilux bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them you listen to the show.

[SPEAKER_00]: That was my nickname in college,
was African nightcrawler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never went to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I was just going to
let that fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that one time we were flyering out
of college.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes you the red wiggler,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a wrestler name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like my dog on his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a red rocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wiggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm skipping this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This red rocket has been brought to you by
the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you want Rocky Mountain Worm
Company worm castings and you are not here

[SPEAKER_02]: They will send you Bokashi.

there or your Bokashi bucket from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these guys are nodding their heads
like, yeah, we know what all this organic
[SPEAKER_02]: soil shit means.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sure do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Bukaki.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of grabbed my attention right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you, I'm just going to let you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fresh out of the lockup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let you have some slack.

email me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just got fun and games ahead of us
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your comedians, tell me a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you hate that shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people do that to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your comedian make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's silly because I still consider myself
an open micer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comedian is something I aspire to be,
but I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're a comedian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting paid for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still a steel worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll consider myself a comedian or
consider the years I've been a comedian as
[SPEAKER_00]: many times as I claim it on my taxes and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you actually start getting booked for
gigs and stuff like that, we're just local
[SPEAKER_01]: feature guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got a lot of heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is a lot of heart,
and that's what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of guys, they just don't have the
heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to go up there and repeat the
same shit every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can tell they're just doing it to
just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got the heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting in the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it because it's a way for me to get
all the negative shit I'm feeling about
[SPEAKER_00]: myself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can make people laugh from it,
then it validates all the shitty things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's kind of a self-righteous way
to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing it for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way Paul does his comedy is
self-deprecatingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might sound like, oh, he's doing it
for himself, and it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also like, I need to tell you
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a healthy way to get shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way cheaper than a therapist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're making me laugh,
we're both getting therapy out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the guys, we're always trying
new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few guys that have fallen
into a trap of not doing new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly regularly, but it's fun to see when
a joke can fail, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see what he wanted to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, damn, dude, if you'd have
twisted this, that joke would have worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's neat seeing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get to see the initial,
and why didn't that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you talk about it, and oh,
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to see it the next time he
does it, and he's got a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence because he's done it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open mic comedy is so fun to watch as an
art form, not just the comedy that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the comedy is the reason you're
putting butts in seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, to watch guys evolve and get
better, and perfect case in point was Dan
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot about Dan Rainey getting
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really not good when he started.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he went from not good, and he was OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now he's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went a lot easier for him to go from
not good to good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think confidence had a lot to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: His material, I thought, was always funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when he told it, he was kind of
unsure about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't really be unsure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it took a lot to get him started,
didn't it, just to get him up the first
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just to get him on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been coming to comedy shows since I
first started doing comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just so scared to get up on
stage and tell a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he finally did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people, once you do it,
that just opens up the front gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was a teenager, I've watched comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell from talking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been into comedy as long as you
guys have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been in that club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to walk up on stage and
throw down one good set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm obviously OK with talking in a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do grow meetings where I just run my
mouth and talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I get just thinking about going up
there to do a set.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to shit my pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It scares the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that that's not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird for me to even think about
getting up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the party or whatever, I'll tell
everybody a joke all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get up there and you really feel
like you have something to say and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to tell these people something and
they don't laugh at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so heartbreaking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's soul crushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's the thing that I like
watching in other guys and in myself is
[SPEAKER_01]: you watch these guys like I was trying to
get to with Dan is like he evolved and you
[SPEAKER_01]: could see that evolution every step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, there's guys
that don't want to come out to shows all
[SPEAKER_01]: they tell the same jokes or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, no, like, look at the new
thing that he did to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know that we're probably getting
pretty deep on like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's like writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like getting tailoring that that
joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something it's like making a
recipe perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time you make that recipe,
it was too spicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you knew what you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took out a little spice, added more
garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched your joke telling evolve,
not just your jokes get better,
[SPEAKER_02]: but your approach to telling.
[SPEAKER_02]: A joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to get naked to have a
punchline anymore because your jokes have
[SPEAKER_02]: some body to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your clothes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the best bits I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do that joke for everybody
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it because it's a visual bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how that's going to fail as a
joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for Dan Rady's Twitter feed so
that we can get at Dan champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for at Dan champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just follow him randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll have no idea why he got a bump on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really funny guy coming out of the
springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few funny people coming out of
the springs, but I think he's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: funnier ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's really working at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's neat to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like having a second job when
you're not getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're not getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm a musician, and I've gone and
played free shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that feeling of just locking in
with the bass player and getting the song
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was worth my set up time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My couple hours on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: To drive to wherever and go do 15 minutes
is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you'll drive up to go do five.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll do 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll do 15 just because they're like,
oh, you drove from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have 15 minutes now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.
Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can get about 15 with all of my
material, but I don't use a lot of old
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you exploiting your jail experience
for material?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I would definitely have some material.
[SPEAKER_00]: A jail material and a recent breakup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should write a joke about these two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get raped and I'm offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did get raped, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my comedy is very personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be 100% honest with my writing
and my comedy because I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way that I can really find my own
voice because I'm still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what I'm exactly doing
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just write from what I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now I'm still confused if you did or
did not get raped because you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: comedian and it's awkward over here a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit winking after you say I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is weird now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quit touching my leg while you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of rape in PCJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a friend who was in there who
was apparently someone's bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made me feel a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we were going to talk about weed in
this show too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just going to be prison sex the
whole talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any sex or anything,
but he would give him foot rubs and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: his clothes and they would share
commissary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was his bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: These weird family roles that are assigned
to you when you're in jail for a
[SPEAKER_00]: considerable amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was only in there for 16 days,
but I still got assigned a certain role.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a thug like you, I bet that 16
days is just rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a bitch like me, that 16 days was the
worst 16 days of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag man boobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: By day six, he was the adabisi of... So
you were about to tell me what your role
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My role was story time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell stories at night so people
can go to sleep because they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep after a while without hearing some
kind of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't get raped and when you talk,
everyone falls asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody liked you in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, people loved me in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had kosher trays that I would trade for
paper because I didn't have any money on
[SPEAKER_00]: my books or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found out Nazis will fucking give me
their teenage daughters for some Jew
[SPEAKER_00]: peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got fresh fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I need if I'm in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only did 15 days and that was almost 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any jail stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either do I.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's behave ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that cannabis is legal in
Colorado, I don't do anything that would
[SPEAKER_02]: even make me worth being in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only thing I ever did was
smoke too much weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't just dab out all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one can worry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wussies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wussies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or my advice, since Colorado is getting
full and it's getting expensive to rent a
[SPEAKER_02]: house here, make cannabis legal where you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're hot and you wear yoga pants,
come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if you're just coming here just
to grow some weed, just do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're easy and you don't mind a fat
chubby guy on top of you, definitely come
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a sales pitch you cannot argue with
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fat chubby, I'll get on top of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smother you all night long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't get on top of you if you're really
scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get on top of me and it's like a
fun air mattress with a penis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the little blow up nub on the
air mattress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read a news article because
Clint actually told me that he had a
[SPEAKER_02]: question for me and I'm going to my text
message to try to remember what that
[SPEAKER_02]: question was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also about using cannabis as a
sacrament.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked a little bit about Jamaica
legalizing cannabis for medical use on a
[SPEAKER_02]: past episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either the last one or the one
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have made it, it used to be
if you were caught with any cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica, it would be a seven day sentence
in a Jamaican jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nothing like the little luxury
condo that you just spent some time in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be- Have you been to Pueblo
County jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I've heard some good stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, everyone in their trades,
stories of like where to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to go to Crowley County.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have carpet, but like apparently
Pueblo County jail is the worst facility
[SPEAKER_02]: in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then the Jamaican jail is,
it's still going to be worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so, and now in Jamaica, if you get
caught with cannabis, it's just a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't go to jail right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a $200 fine if you have less
than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now guys like us can go and also
they've made it to where if you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana card in the States,
you can go there and register your medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana card for a small fee and get a
pass to buy medical marijuana while you
[SPEAKER_02]: were in Jamaica from their stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard their weed sucks though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to now because a lot of
people from the United States saw this
[SPEAKER_02]: coming, that cannabis is going to be
legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have friends in the industry that
have already flown down there and set up
[SPEAKER_02]: shops and testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And BC bubble man was down there teaching
everybody how to make good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going on down there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that's kind of, kind of what I
can tell you about Jamaica without talking
[SPEAKER_02]: too much about what we said on another
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you asked me, ironically,
you said, how about using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_02]: sacrament?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then today I look at the cannabis and
there it's the news page.
[SPEAKER_02]: I check out the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their headline is new in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cannabis church gets its chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where I got that idea for
that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice was because Indiana passed that law
that allows people to discriminate against
[SPEAKER_01]: gays like now, like as of today,
as a part of religion, is it okay to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: weed there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to be because they can't tell
you what to do by that law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't read the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to uphold one,
you got to uphold the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll read the whole article here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sub headline says, if someone is
smoking in our church, God bless them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Church founder, Bill Levin says,
this is a church to show a proper way of
[SPEAKER_02]: life, a loving way of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all called can notarians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I feel about the word can
notarians.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll wear Reeboks and drink the punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have something cannabis related
to add to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's hear it before we get into the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Jews smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke weed and a lot of them,
especially now with like the younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: like more alternative Hasidic groups that
are coming up, like in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the non-ox and everything like that,
they use it as a sort of way to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: their cultural roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The holy anointing oil had cannibosum in
it, which is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had so much in it that it would
have psychoactive effects in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other cases, they think that when
the high priest would go into a tent to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to God, they would use things like
cannibosum, different other herbs and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and incense and olive oil and the
THC oil and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just basically hotbox
themselves as a way to speak to God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Paul's Jewish by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a book about it called Cannabis
Hasidim that if anyone's interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: they should definitely check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of religions use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think not just the Rastafarians use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something, even if you're not
from part of the world where cannabis was,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is something very similar where you
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually cannabis seems to have made
its way all the way around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody was smoking cannabis,
all of the religions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Saudis have smoked it and the Saudis
get overlooked a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm going to read this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the article is by Sarah Pulliam Bailey
from the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, the First Church of Cannabis
Incorporated has been approved by
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana's Secretary of State after the
state's religious freedom legislation
[SPEAKER_02]: became law last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: The church's founder, Bill Levin said he
filed paperwork in a direct response to
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana Governor Mike Pence's signing the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law
[SPEAKER_02]: last Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secretary of State Connie Lawson approved
the church as a religious corporation with
[SPEAKER_02]: all the stated intent to start a church
based on love and understanding with
[SPEAKER_02]: compassion for all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is listed as the church's
sacrament and its doctrine, Levin said,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he will set up a church hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The church will plan to grow hemp,
he said, though they will not buy or sell
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone is smoking in our church,
God bless them, Levin said.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a church to show a proper way of
life, a loving way of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're called Cannitarians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they kind of linked that word
from the Rastafarians a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unitarians, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unitarians, any kind of Aryans,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fan of the Aryans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen your swastika tattoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I have two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matches your Hitler mustache very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One on each ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something we're doing here in
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there those sects up?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually Green Faith Ministries,
which is a cannabis-related church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're in Greeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're in Greeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a group in Springs when my old
band, Stem Beach Soul Revival,
[SPEAKER_00]: check them out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We played a dab party at Hookah Bar in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy who was out there handing
out sacramental joints and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took about an ounce of hash and
dabbed everybody out all night that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fun night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the last time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed a few times here, but that was a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I got him so high he had to get
up and leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then John Bueno turned as white as the
walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it John Bueno?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think John Bueno took a dab and
turned as white as the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, John Bueno wouldn't have taken a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Luke Cowie.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Previn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Previn Martinez.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been so many people at this table
that we've dabbed out that have just
[SPEAKER_02]: turned pale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calling people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I feel about dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs look like drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you break out a blowtorch and you
start heating that shit up, I'm sure it
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, when you're dabbing somewhere,
just remember that, that you're using a
[SPEAKER_02]: torch and it looks like we're heating up
some crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seriously does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are discriminating against you
for doing dabs, I am too, because it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are ruining weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's supposedly cleaner than
smoking the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less crap that you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smoking the more pure form of it
and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just fucks me up so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, don't they do it a different method
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: The method you're probably talking about
is Rosentech, where we're just using a
[SPEAKER_02]: pressing comb, like a straightening iron,
squeezing the juice out of the bud by that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the BHO, the butane, there's no
butane left in our product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We figured out how to clean it out real
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke cigarettes, so I don't really care
about butane or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting horrible things into my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a shout out to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys ever smoked those
before, but give them a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to talk about that on a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were three guys in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took like a half gram dab and did and
choke, and the other two guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarette smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took little tiny dabs and had to
get up and leave so they could go hock
[SPEAKER_02]: loogies and die for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to take fat dabs,
if you want to do big hikes, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go high in elevation, if you want to
live long, don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be a productive,
good human being, don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one of those people, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you don't want to get old,
smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to get old either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old, saggy tits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost 38 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I went into jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm losing these man tits, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, less fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still all the funny, half the fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still fat, but less this time,
which is really like, I wish all my ex
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriends would come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think this is the least amount
I've weighed in my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like Paul has a few things he
needs to get off his chest because he
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps going back to a specific topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my entire spectrum of ex
girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give them a chance to come fuck
me again now that I'm better looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you out there ever hear this
and you want to come back, I'm more
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's really, you know,
up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's kind of thug now because he spent
some time in the slum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little thug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a lot of friends in there who want
me to do nefarious things for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they can't wait to get out and get
back into trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: His eyebrows say thug life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a 13 tattoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the inside of his lip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good with your teardrop tattoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a lot of fucked up stories from
Mexican cartel guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this one kid that I was in there
with, he's not a kid, he's like 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he apparently fucked two chickens to
death when he was like 13 in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep reading this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana is currently illegal in Indiana
for both medical and recreational use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the church could test the application
of the new law.
[SPEAKER_02]: RFRA prevents Indiana's government from
substantially burgeoning a person's
[SPEAKER_02]: exercise of religion if it can demonstrate
that it is at least the... Let me try that
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm still fucked up from what Paul
just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it can demonstrate that it is the least
restrictive means of furthering a
[SPEAKER_02]: compelling governmental interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the best segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we asked him why he did it,
he just said, cause it's Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mexico, you have some explaining to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he behead the chickens that you've
done?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if they ate them or
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, that egg came out of that
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That egg is about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look what I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a waste of chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all hungry when he was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he eat it afterwards?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we asked when he said,
no, that was gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's gross about that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an interesting character.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Levin who spoke to the post by phone
said the church... Yeah, this is from
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: This part, Paul's part is from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Levin who spoke to the post by phone said
the church has received $2,000 in
[SPEAKER_02]: donations and received more than 7,000
Facebook fans in the five days that it has
[SPEAKER_02]: existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hopes to build the first church or
temple built of hempcrete, a building
[SPEAKER_02]: material similar to concrete that includes
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot about hempcrete and I
think it's amazing that we need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: using this more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Industrial hemp is a good idea,
especially since we can now grow hemp in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just taking rocks out and putting hemp in
instead of concrete?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they make concrete.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to sound stupid and try to
act like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's exactly how they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they're using some kind of
cannabinoid as the powdery agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's apparently extremely fire resistant
so your houses won't burn down and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does, it'll smell real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll smell really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how we're two capable white men and
we don't know how to make concrete.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a steelworker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little mad about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, yeah, like Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, he might not know how to make
concrete.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy that makes rebar, probably should
know how to make concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just seems like a hobby of yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'll make concrete on the side,
just fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whipping up a batch of Crete.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting for Adam Carolla to come over so
we can hang some drywall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're looking at those choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Carolla, fix your fucking eyebrows,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think he has tattooed under
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just grew them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Loveline.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1-800-LOVELINE?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that the thick eyebrows is in with
girls today because I love thick eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated the really thin cholo eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pencil them in real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not an attractive look.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the prettiness of the girls
I'm looking at, the eyebrows is not what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concentrating on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not what you're
concentrating on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a nice face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If she doesn't have a mustache,
Clint's excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you shaved your arms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay with a mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I can grow a better one,
then it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read some more of this
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're progressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get through this one
article through the whole 45-minute show
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll be happy with life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're progressing to get a building
property to be our holy ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to set up counseling for
heroin service and we have a huge epidemic
[SPEAKER_02]: in this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably have alcoholics anonymous
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to allow alcohol on the
premise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Levin also wrote out the new Deedee Dozen,
Ten Commandments Like List with
[SPEAKER_02]: suggestions for better living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm laughing at this article and
you guys while I'm trying to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bibles of other religions are
yesteryear about the drinking out of goat
[SPEAKER_02]: skins.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: About drinking out of goat skins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't relate to the people with GPS
in their hand and 7,000 tunes in that same
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: The church is very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first good book we're going to ask
petitioners to read and understand is The
[SPEAKER_02]: Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it kind of feels to me like this guy
is copying that church on Weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that church on Weeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't watch Weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched the TV show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good TV show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up until Nancy got shot and then I was
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, spoiler alert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if you haven't fucking watched that
by now, I'm going to spoil the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode of Weeds definitely made
me tear up though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good season finale or
series finale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, more article.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says I'm very faith driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very spiritual and I'm filled with
love, he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that most religions are misled into
gross perversions of what they are meant
[SPEAKER_02]: to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: This path has led me to lead a religion
that people in today's world can relate
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any guilt doctrine built in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any sins built in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the church is established,
members will be asked for individual
[SPEAKER_02]: donations of $4.20 a month, he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana attorney and political commentator
Abdul Hakim Shabazz wrote that Indiana
[SPEAKER_02]: legislators may have put the state in a
position to acknowledge those who profess
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke pot as a religious sacrament.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, if I would argue that under RFA,
as long as you can show that reefer is
[SPEAKER_02]: part of your religious practices,
you got a pretty good shot of getting off
[SPEAKER_02]: scot-free, he wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, under RFRA, the state has to
articulate a compelling interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: preventing you from smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I argue they can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Church of Cannabis is just one test in
many under Indiana's new law, which has
[SPEAKER_02]: escalated a national prominence in the
past week, raising questions about the
[SPEAKER_02]: future of religious freedom laws and gay
rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I should recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason that this is popping up is
because in Indiana, they just tried to do
[SPEAKER_02]: some rude shit to gay people, citing the
Bible as their reasoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these people said, well,
if you're going to cite the Bible for
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, the Bible says, I don't even want
to get into the Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks' interpretation of the Bible
says that homosexuality is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say if I agree or
disagree, I'm going to say that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what that one book says and what people
have read.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, since that is a thing, we're also
saying that in that same book,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've said that all these herbs are here
for us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing by these rules on the gay
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing by these rules on the pot
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha, we win.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what this church is trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: With two Qs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnarly, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some weed in church.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a Letterman top 10 of his
do's and don'ts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, thou shalt not spill the bong
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thou shalt not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate when people use the Old Testament
as their sort of guide to hating on gays
[SPEAKER_00]: and hating on anything because that's
where all the anti-gay stuff comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't come from the New Testament.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's all about the cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why a lot of people think
that they put the anti-gay thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Testament was you're living in a
desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're living around people who are all
trying to kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, every baby counts at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Old Testament is just a guide in how
to survive in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some religions say that you're not
supposed to jerk off because you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to waste sperm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that could have been carrying on our
religion and our race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's continuing on our people so we can
continue to exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not a fucking sinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get that chicken
pregnant and keep our religion going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not living in a desert around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not living in a desert around a
bunch of hostile barbarians who are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, yes, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of are, just in a little bit
different sense than back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the world's grossly overpopulated so
you can have sex with a guy if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should, you know, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do that, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried but I'm open.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a handsome young guy who wants
to take me on a date and- Paul,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've put yourself out here a lot on this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've hoarded yourself out to the max.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to my comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ex-girlfriends come fuck me.
[SPEAKER_02]: New girlfriends come fuck me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dudes, I'm gay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting weird with life now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live a little, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secret of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give a secret to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know, man, if that's
something that I don't, I guess I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like it's like weed sacramental to me
but it's just kind of like a hangout thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even do it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a social thing for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather go and hang out with
somebody but- Are you a religious or a
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual person otherwise?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's kind of a way for people
to just smoke pot and kind of abuse it in
[SPEAKER_00]: that sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a lot of people... I do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first dab is medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: That first dab makes my shoulders not
hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I knocked myself clean the fuck out
a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like clean out and the first dab makes
that not hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second dab makes me good and high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third dab, then I'm just dabbed and having
fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fourth and fifth dab, that is just me
abusing it because I've got a lot of dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: and I like to see how high we can get
today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the morning when I'm here by myself
and I need some thinking to do and I got
[SPEAKER_02]: to clear my head and I got a lot of shit
on my mind and the world's going too fast
[SPEAKER_02]: for me to get away from it all,
turn off all the lights, turn off the TV,
[SPEAKER_02]: turn off the phone, turn off the computer,
get as silent as I can, roll up a big fat
[SPEAKER_02]: spliff of just flowers, just buds,
buds that I grew, my own personal hidden
[SPEAKER_02]: away bud that nobody else has access to
and nobody gets to see, roll that up,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a big fatty middle finger sized
joint by myself and close my eyes and just
[SPEAKER_02]: see what I am really thinking because
sometimes my head's just going too fast to
[SPEAKER_02]: even really hear what I'm thinking and
when I get nice and blazed and just close
[SPEAKER_02]: my eyes and just shut up for a minute and
get into that quiet space, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, I didn't really, I'm not mad
about some Facebook shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you close your eyes and go into that
bubble, whatever she said on Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy talking shit about your Instagram
picture, you don't really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're missing your favorite TV show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You realize like what's inside and it just
kind of, it shows me more what I really
[SPEAKER_02]: need to pay attention to and it kind of
calms me down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I felt like I had the opposite thing
for me, especially since I haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking pot and smoking anything or doing
anything really for the past like 40
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 days and 50 days, however many days
it's been, is I was definitely abusing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke too much needlessly just to smoke
it, just to see how high I could get,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't necessarily like clear my mind
or help me think straight or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would kind of just make me think in
worse ways because I was always second
[SPEAKER_00]: guessing myself and I was just
overthinking things and then my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't shut off because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I haven't been smoking,
I felt like it's greatly improved like my
[SPEAKER_00]: writing and just my overall sense of
being.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something I wanted to touch on,
kind of change the vibe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Clint's kind of, I'm going to call
you a lightweight bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke weed like a little girl,
but you're a cheap date.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big man too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also bring my own weed so that way it's
not even like imposing on anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he showed up with, I smoked your weed
and it was tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some pretty tasty Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't taste bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't make my mouth burn and it got me
stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came over and he took one rip off of a
pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you write some comedy,
do you write it when you're straight and
[SPEAKER_02]: then embellish it when you get lit or how
does smoking affect your writing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it come into play?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's kind of like there's two Clint's
in that aspect because there's Stone Clint
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there's Sober Clint and never the
two shall meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stone Clint can write some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the shit that comes out that I
find in my phone when I sober up,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what the fuck was I thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I see, and I remember what I was
trying to do with it, but there's no way I
[SPEAKER_01]: would have ever written that sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I write a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this last month, I haven't written
a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been taking some time away from
comedy just to clear my head, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get my medications straight, you know,
cause I'm on a couple of like
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressants cause old happy Clint
wasn't super happy here recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing group therapy and then seeing
a one on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been seeing a therapist too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, that's like my favorite time of
the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I go talk with a dude for like an
hour and he's just like, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what you say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I don't do anything that's
terrible, but I don't do anything or I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't feel like I'm doing good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, what I was getting at is like,
Oh, I feel both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get real introspective like you do
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, what, what is the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem that I'm feeling and then deal
with it right in that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also gotten the way that Paul
gets and where it's like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: why is that making me feel this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to like quit doing everything that
I do wrong and only work because I got a
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 year old daughter and I'm afraid she's
not going to get to college cause she
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to be a surgeon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I start dwelling on that and that
freaks me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I get like the super happy way to
like, you know, this joke that I wrote to
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe it's a little bit long,
but you go and edit it when you're sober
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you tell it when you're so,
I only, I don't like getting up in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of people stoned because I feel like
that's my time to be on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're on the spotlight, you need to
be on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do a lot of mic time high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I'm not high, it's so much
better for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel, and Doug Benson, bro, I love you,
but I'm going to say this out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel Doug Benson being so high,
really squishes his comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could be a better performer if he
weren't so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I could see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It slows him down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen him forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I personally have gotten Doug Benson
so high before a show that he's just
[SPEAKER_02]: flubbed it complete bits and looked at me
and said, Rasta Jeff, you got me way too
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he told me on stage that I got him
too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, you'd never see a lot of
other comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't see Bill Cosby doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the silence that you just brought
to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like picking on Bill Cosby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like picking on Michael Jackson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's the people have chosen sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you fucking decide which side
you're on publicly, then the other side
[SPEAKER_02]: hates you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to stay impartial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, either do I.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to, you got to do what
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to hate me for hating a
rapist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if, if, if him sexually abusing me
and gets me a TV spot, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even need to eat the pills,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to hate me for
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, April 7th, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: April 7th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come see comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come see comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but don't come for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come for Mary Mack and her husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really funny people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come for you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is big.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is bid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he have a lot of words, a lot of
letters in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Tim, Tim something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, they don't share the same last
names probably for entertainment reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't know about all that
change in your name stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go with your real name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot more to ask about that,
but we got thrown off track and I have no
[SPEAKER_02]: idea what the fuck I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we were talking about when we
were writing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's both ways
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can be stoned and right,
but it, my inspiration just comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: like the weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just man, like watching an infomercial and
it's like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I thinking about like this
different way to watch YouTube all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's very strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I started out with just
like trying to write comedy about funny
[SPEAKER_00]: situations or just like little things that
I think of and I can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have to, it's all written about my
personal experiences and about like my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal feelings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeps it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when you're telling like,
listen to any artist that's written an
[SPEAKER_02]: album about themselves, it was real.
[SPEAKER_02]: That first album that most people come out
with, it's their real life experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That second and third album, it's studio
pressure and they ran out of life
[SPEAKER_02]: experience because now they're just being
a musician or that, or they really took
[SPEAKER_02]: something from that experience and they
made another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times, and I'm not trying to
say that Matus Yahoo's first album live at
[SPEAKER_02]: Stubbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was where he blew his load,
but you could tell he spent his whole life
[SPEAKER_02]: writing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, he's like,
Oh, I have to make another album.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that way about comedy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll see some guys that like their
first, like their first comedy special was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Whoa, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you knew that they had worked like 12
years to get that just that one hour,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 minutes, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even like they're like, uh,
the first time I saw Dane Cook was,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I tried so hard not to bring him into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was funny back in the day,
back when we were in, in high school and
[SPEAKER_01]: middle school, he was the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you can't take that away from him
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people say, Oh, he stole jokes
from people, but 90% of our dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, man, you know, he's,
yeah, he sold out Madison square garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he made comedy blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still writing his coat tails because
of him is why like premium blend had him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember a lot of sets other
than like him, but you, you'll see like he
[SPEAKER_01]: blew up and now we're all riding that coat
tails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember what my point was
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but like his first album, that's what
I mean is like his first, like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you see him and he's not as funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like going through the motions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched his last special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to watch, but I could still go
back and watch his first special.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best, uh, comedy specials I've
seen in a long time is the bill Burr
[SPEAKER_02]: special that's in black and white.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you watch that Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't watched that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you guys, sorry, you feel that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the name of the, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what, uh, since we're on this,
we're not even talking about weed today,
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk a little bit more
about comedy, something we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, we're going to talk about Rasta
and stuff for a second to on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not happening with Ari Shafir on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched like all 50 something
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all of it's on YouTube.

channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a playlist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to number one and click play and
watch them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Joey Diaz's are the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey Diaz is one of my favorite comedians
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Joe Rogan does a couple of great ones
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big Jay Okerson will make you pee your
pants laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought Kyle Kanane's was really Kyle
Kanane is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Kyle Kanane fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, who's the guy that got in the fight in
a phone booth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, listen, find that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's mother, I think Clint's mom,
Clint's mom's on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won.
[SPEAKER_01]: She won that fight in the phone booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about comedy,
I brought up the event page so I can give
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody the full spiel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mary Mack has been on Comedy Central's
live at Gotham, NBC's last comic standing,
[SPEAKER_00]: Montreal's just for laughs festival on the
San Francisco sketch fest and her husband,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Harmsdon has been on Letterman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have people that have
been on TV.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actual people who have done stuff
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, uh, April 7th, Tuesday,
uh, the rainbow at nine PM for five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five dollars Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really missing out if you don't go
to this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, there's a good chance I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's right near the green light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right up the street from the green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go check it out and have some laughs,
get some drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come eat Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we've really described him in a
weird way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a Hitler mustache and a teardrop
tattoo from our description.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have thug life tattoo to my eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desperate, desperate for companionship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's thrown that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to remind everybody of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely desperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desperately wants attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs some, he needs a hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what he needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mouth hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mouth hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my penis.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what you try to do with these
boys, it always goes back to a dick joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're, we're not comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're open micers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the mentality, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean we treat it serious,
but we're not getting paid for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even all that money that Paul's bringing
in like, yeah, $5 donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul ain't making shit on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all for this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying pizza and beer for the comedians
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually get sponsored by Paul's pizza
in Canoles in Pueblo, which if you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: had Paul's pizza, you should definitely go
try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Norwood where the taco casa is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like two topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just looked at the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large pizzas for like $12.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess how fat he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he knows the pizza specials guys,
you get to guess his weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're my sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess his weight on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it cause I tell people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiss his weight on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big fan of pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag 257.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what stops me from committing
suicide is like, well, you're going to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: pizza again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, just make it through tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you listen to that Pete Holmes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you watch, listen to, you made it
weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't live.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had Henry Rollins on and he goes,
Henry, why do you want people to live
[SPEAKER_01]: longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes two words, more pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Rollins is a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated Henry Rollins until I read his
book, Get in the Van.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much respect for that guy after
reading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created the DC scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a part of the DC scene and then,
you know, created the LA scene with SST
[SPEAKER_00]: records and black flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys should just do a punk rock
podcast or some sort of punk rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a, not this show, but we're going to
do another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just called punk rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do one episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like three minutes long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just yell like a sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it'll just be a punk rock song of a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite band is black flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you scream something obnoxious
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll punch each other and drink
a beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it'll be the end of the show.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a black flag kind of show.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is punk rock Mike when you need him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steel toed sneakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool ass band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if punk rock Mike can still
have the moniker punk rock Mike when he's
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a hobo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he should just be hobo Mike at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Van by the river Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put this show back on
track.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wanted to relate my,
my, my ganja meditation to your writing
[SPEAKER_02]: session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're just being stoned and
being goofy, that's you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're kind of doing the same thing,
just in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're meditating and connecting with
yourself the same way I am just still very
[SPEAKER_02]: new at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on a different platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that doesn't, I don't think that
plays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think that there's still more
self exploration to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I haven't been willing to do yet
because I'm afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to smoke some DMT?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I like DMT.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to smoke some DMT.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul just lit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got a whole new demeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: His thug life went up on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't test for DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms and DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: My probate crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never, I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag lighter sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I have to abstain from alcohol and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't say anything about PCP or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dimethyltripe demeanor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ayahuasca was on that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can't kind of, yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say we can't promote or
condone any use of any illicit or
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelic drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, fucking, if you have real DMT,
smoke DMT, learn about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm going to say about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to talk too much about it
on the show, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it, Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to force anybody to do it,
but if you're curious, if there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: shit inside yourself that you want to know
about and you want to get inside your own
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to know how shitty of a human
being you are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or figure out how to stop being such a
shitty human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how to stop being such a shitty
human being.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a good blast of DMT and sit back on
the couch and close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The debate lately has been open our eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open our closed eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close your eyes, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the full experience.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell the smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste the tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a whole Starburst commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: DMT flavored Starburst.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got almost an hour, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to edit this at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put this out just like it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you didn't say anything too stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a few plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your Twitter handle, Paul?
[SPEAKER_00]: VHS underscore nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collect VHS tapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you guys out there want to
get rid of your mom's old VHS collection
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you have an old VHS collection,
I'd definitely love to go through it and
[SPEAKER_00]: take what you don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a PO box we could ship those
to?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just come out and take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul will come pick up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll drive all the way to Pennsylvania to
come pick up your VHS tapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out on Instagram, which is just
VHSnerd, to see all the stuff that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop me a line, ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it hard to find a VCR to play that shit
on now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole VHS thing is starting to get
really popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because of all the hipsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even necessarily think it's
hipsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think a lot of new movies are
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maniac just got remade not recently with
the... Frodo Baggins, whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy's name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samwise Gans.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fuck's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Elijah Wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elijah Wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see him in fucking Wilfred,
but I just couldn't think of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a new movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a remake that he did that
was released on VHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new VHS releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also reissues of a lot of old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Company just got done reissuing Cannibal
Fero and Cannibal Holocaust, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: some Italian spaghetti splatter movies
that are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for the word spaghetti
splatter to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spaghetti splatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spaghetti splatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Italian horror is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really nothing better than that,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any Italian horror movies on
tape, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get them to Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you just have an internet connection
where you can watch stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people like vinyl and they will
not use the iPod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a nerd in a video store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my favorite thing to do when my
parents would not want to deal with me and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like, I'll just take them to
the video store so we can rent a movie and
[SPEAKER_00]: a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I became a nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I first saw my first horror
big box and really got intrigued by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover art.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really why when I go out and I
search through tons and tons of tapes at
[SPEAKER_00]: thrift stores, I see something that I've
never seen before, but the cover art's
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, but the movie's fucking
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it because the cover art's so good
and I just love shitty movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best shitty movie you've
watched?
[SPEAKER_00]: The best shitty movie is definitely You're
the Hunter from the Future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the shittiest fucking movie I have
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts out kind of like a fantasy epic
where they're fighting dinosaurs and
[SPEAKER_00]: barbarians and there's a point when he
uses a pterodactyl as a hang lighter to
[SPEAKER_00]: kick someone in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just segues into, now he's the
Hunter from the Future so I should have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen this coming, it segues into androids
and spaceships and all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the weirdest fucking thing I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can check it out, you can
actually watch it on YouTube for like $3
[SPEAKER_00]: is You're the Hunter from the Future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if any girls want to come over to my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any dudes like we heard earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any dudes, you know, we'll get weird
and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come watch some tapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your own couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's up there with that one and then
Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chopping Mall is fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years and years ago like on HBO or
Cinemax.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, remember USA Up all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where I saw Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where I saw that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was clean enough to be on USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was a little guy and my mom would
watch USA Up all night with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably where we saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first time that I saw Toxic
Avenger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up Toxy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the Toxic Avenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monster hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two copies on VHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an unrated copy and I have the
edited R rated copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just giving everybody an option to
go see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to go watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't seen the Toxic Avenger and
you love pot, you should definitely get
[SPEAKER_00]: really high and then watch the Toxic
Avenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plugs, where do we find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hasn't been doing much social media,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taking a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going crazy with social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check me out on shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also check out the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have t-shirts too, Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
