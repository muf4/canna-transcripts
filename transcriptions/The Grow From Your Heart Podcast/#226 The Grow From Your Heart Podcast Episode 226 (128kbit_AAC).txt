[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rasta Jeff, and it's Thursday,
so that means it's time for another
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, I'm posting episodes 66,
67, 68, 69, and 70 of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're new to the show, let me explain
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of listeners have been asking for
the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the old episodes have really
detailed grow lessons, and there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: episode where I schedule a perpetual grow,
there's an episode where I talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: drying and curing buds, a lot of the good
stuff is in the old episodes when I first
[SPEAKER_02]: started, and a lot of those episodes have
fallen out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be episode 226, so that means
there are 126 episodes that have fallen
[SPEAKER_02]: out of iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to put them back somehow,
but I figured that every time I put in a
[SPEAKER_02]: new episode, a new one falls right out,
so I'm doing three hour chunks of
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three hours is about as long as my
recording software wants to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three hours seems to be about the biggest
file you guys can download.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into your phones without messing up your
data plans, so I'm doing three hour chunks
[SPEAKER_02]: of old episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That puts usually three to five episodes
in a block.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you guys can hear the old gems,
and then I can continue to put out old
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on Thursdays, new stuff on Mondays,
and everybody gets old content and new
[SPEAKER_02]: content, and you can get all caught up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm posting the old videos to
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making videos as I go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am up to number 65 now, so if you want
to check them out on YouTube, number one
[SPEAKER_02]: through 65 is available on the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, let me do a quick disclaimer before
we get into the episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I mention any advertising, any promos,
any giveaways, any contests, anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that has long expired.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that stuff is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no giveaways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no promos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no contests right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send me an email,
the new email address is growfromyourheart
[SPEAKER_02]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Facebook, it is Grow From Your Heart
Podcast, and if you want to find me on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, it's irey underscore genetics,
I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: irey genetics is, of course, my seed
company, my breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I've
been rambling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope this made some sense to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: With no further ado, here's a throwback
Thursday chunk of old episodes of the Grow
[SPEAKER_02]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's episode 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said the wrong numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 66 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source

cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about Friday night,
because Friday night's when it all kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: started for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys heard about my Morgan Heritage
concert adventure, and then Thursday I
[SPEAKER_02]: went and got stoned with the reggae bands
and hydro, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left you guys off on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday night, I packed up, headed to
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather was terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It rained the entire drive to Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 125 miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me close to two and a half hours
just to get to the south end of Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove to... Garden of Wheaton had an
Airbnb spot just outside of Boulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost to Boulder, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Louisville, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a gorgeous little Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The house that they got there,
sweet score, but it was kind of far out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the way for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I drove out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got dabbed out with some of the crew
from Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to meet up with those guys,
hang out with them on a Friday night,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'm glad I did, because they've been
busy as shit since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hung out, got dabbed out with the
Garden of Wheaton crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I headed back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got kind of hungry, got kind of tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I headed back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hotel was super cozy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was glad I got that room that I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cheap, so I was a little
questioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of questioning on how it was
going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was affordable and it was cozy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great room for one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little bed, a couch,
a desk, a TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I barely turned on the TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used it as a nightlight mainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some pizza delivered and I went to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate the shit out of some pizza,
some local pizza that was around there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I went to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday morning, I woke up kind of early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to the cup around nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 8.30, 8.45 when I got to the
cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: The parking lots were starting to get full
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was one spot I found that was
open right away, right near the gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cost me 30 bucks to park about 30 feet
from the gate that I needed to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I parked my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I headed into the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a vendor wristband, so I was able to
get in before everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The event doesn't open until noon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having the vendor wristband really helped
me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got in at nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of neat to see the cannabis cup
come together.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I walked in, it was just a bunch of
empty spaces with square booths and a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of walkways.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people were emptying everything out of
boxes and everyone was all frantic and
[SPEAKER_02]: moving around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the smoke fest that you guys
saw, that everybody that went there saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: People looked stressed as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, by noon, the place was packed
and jumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got in early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately started linking up with
people that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only took me a few seconds to walk in
and see people that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I need to give a big shout out to
Robert and Anita.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they listen to the podcast
or not, but I have some friends that are
[SPEAKER_02]: local friends I bumped into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a big ass line outside the cup,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a vendor entrance and I just
walked right in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody asked me for any credentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never showed a wristband.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never showed an ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never showed a ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked right in that son of a bitch,
right past everybody, right into the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the cannabis cup at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: while everybody else was waiting in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm a kind guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had bumped into Robert and Anita while I
was in line or while I was walking from
[SPEAKER_02]: the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to actually use a porta
potty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, well, should I saw my
friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: I should call them and tell them about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I invited them to come join me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met them over by another area of
those inside the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they walked around with me for a
little while and hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Robert and Anita for
keeping me company for the first part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I knew a lot of people there at
the cup and they kind of got annoyed that
[SPEAKER_02]: every 10 feet we would walk, somebody
would bump into me and take a picture with
[SPEAKER_02]: us and hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to go cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they ditched me, which they didn't
really ditch me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me they were taking off,
which was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Robert and Anita took off and had fun,
left me wandering around for myself for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bumped into so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I went to a booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to dab and I ran into Johnny B
from Nogu Nonstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a cool booth and he said,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: And his crew said hi to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the back of their booth,
they shared a booth with some other
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these fellers, man, I feel like a dick
right now because there were two brothers
[SPEAKER_02]: that looked very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them confused multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned them by the end of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one dude's name was Ari and there's a
brother with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another guy that looked very
much like Ari.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me, you can hear the parts of my
paper right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a little everyone's given out
their shatter in these little envelopes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little, I think they used to be for
coin trading.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little coin envelopes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is labeled MOT Extractions Cheese
Nug Run, one gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they gave me this and I've still got
quite a bit of it left.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm going to do right now for you
guys, for MOT Extractions, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a dab of this Cheese Nug Run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly already know that I love
it, but I want to take a dab of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you what, oh, that's too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take this medium sized dab on the
show here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about some MOT Extractions Nug
Run.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the first dab that I took at the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was how I walked into the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I was introduced with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take a dab of it and we'll
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a nice chunky sized dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't too ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good and chunky though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll talk about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor is very smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste like cheese to me or the
strain the cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get kind of a, there's some sweetness to
it and there's a little bit of funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the cheese is setting in now
that it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: My tongue is kind of absorbing it a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cotton mouth thing is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to take a drink by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely the hint of the cheese
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little funk, a little sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to smoke the rest of
this ground that they gave me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a nice mellow indica high.
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyes got droopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The appearance it's super clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a right between shatter and snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had it for several days
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in my car for a day and it's still
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That still looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will give a positive thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Rost and Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: MOT extractions, cheese, Negron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find them on Instagram or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll follow you guys after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I approve of your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out for all the morning dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me find my notes I took here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly have notes because I'm trying
to cover all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually I bumped into my friend Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Jay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to at DreadfulJay on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my buddy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thought that was my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she lives in Cali and I live in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she can really, you know, that'd be
awkward to have a girlfriend so far away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if she stays, my friend will
be best friends forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't fuck that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, shout out to Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually I bumped into her, bumped into
her shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: She ran from across the cup and tackled
hugged me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She jumped up and latched up onto me and
gave me the biggest, sweetest hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen her in a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great to get that hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, mama?
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you already.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's only been gone for a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jay and I raged the cup for most of the
first day together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked around selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a box of seeds and I wore an irie
genetics t-shirt and put my dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_02]: down and just walked with my box of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sold plenty of packs of seeds that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did spend some time at the Sour Seeds
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Rob at the Sour Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Rusty at Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first day I spent some time at that
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I had more seed sales by
walking around and I got to see more
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I abandoned the booth idea and just
went and mingled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also got a lot of compliments on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expected more reaction to the seeds and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought people would be more interested
in my beans, but a lot of people knew who
[SPEAKER_02]: I was because of my experience on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I am reading notes and talking now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I headed back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, where am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a lot of compliments on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the cannabis cup, it got cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's where I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got fucking cold, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All weekend, the weather kept changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it got cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I headed back to the hotel room to warm
up, get some food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate some of that pizza that I had left
over from the night before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty dangalicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took a couple fatty dabs and
fell asleep for a couple hours because I
[SPEAKER_02]: got a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was up early.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that, I woke up and I headed to
a private party.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a private party outside the
Oriental Theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we weren't able to smoke in the
theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never even made it inside the theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it was loud as shit and crowded,
but we weren't able to smoke in there
[SPEAKER_02]: because the fire department, the police,
and the MED were all doing random
[SPEAKER_02]: inspections on clubs that weekend to see
who was smoking because they knew people
[SPEAKER_02]: were going to be smoking in clubs and it's
illegal to smoke in places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we weren't allowed to smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found a way around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess since the party's over,
excuse me, I'm burping, I guess since the
[SPEAKER_02]: party's over, I could blow up the spa.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside the theater, these people parked
two tour buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the tour buses had a private party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since the bus is private, nobody can
come in and tell us that we can't smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops aren't even welcome on the bus
without a warrant or unless a crime
[SPEAKER_02]: happens in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire department has no damn reason and
the MED is definitely not coming on a
[SPEAKER_02]: private tour bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of our friends, I don't want to
say their names, but big shout out for you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys listening to this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fucking smooth of you to pull it
off that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They set up tour buses and we just went up
on the tour buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to be kind of invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to know what was up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a Facebook and a text message
saying, hey, bro, this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on these buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went up on the bus, dabbed out in
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a bong going.
[SPEAKER_02]: One tour bus was set up like a party bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a bong going around.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were serving drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a full on DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other bus was being used for a private
breeder's only seed swap type of event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go in there and meet a bunch of
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of like Dark Horse Genetics was in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that just bred the cherry Afghan,
man, I wish I could remember your name
[SPEAKER_02]: because I should smell delicious,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people were just swapping seeds and
there was a little seed sales going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great, but it got kind of late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give some of my seeds to some
really respectful people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Spliff of cannabis has some,
or Mr. Spliff of, now he's of Gage Green,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Mr. Spliff has some of my beans now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be growing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got late.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went back to my hotel to gear up for
day two because this was only the first
[SPEAKER_02]: day of the cup, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to meet up with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to hang out with Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to list all the people
that I saw because I will forget more
[SPEAKER_02]: people than I remembered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a huge weekend and I got a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got dabbed out and I recently had a head
injury and I feel like I don't remember as
[SPEAKER_02]: much shit as I should.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for Sunday, I slept in a little
because I wore myself out Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely was exhausted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I slept in a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I headed to the cup around lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the grocery store and got a
bunch of fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I had the vendor wristband,
I was able to take some fruit and some
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy drinks into my backpack with me
and sneak those in because I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: security thing to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the normal people had to go through
security.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the little VIP vendor pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just got to walk right past all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dude, that dab is working by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cheese nugget is definitely kicking
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I slept in a little, took some
fruit with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had some food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me about an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: An hour to park that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I got to the 58th street exit,
traffic was already backed up on the exit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took me 15 minutes to get from the
exit to the parking areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to drive around for another
20 or 30 to find a parking spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the parking cost me 20 or 30 bucks
each day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got into the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wandered around and then eventually I
bumped into Jay again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her and I walked around the cup and bumped
into a bunch of friends until we decided
[SPEAKER_02]: we needed some serious dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the cannabis cup, you'd think there's a
lot of places to hang out and take some
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs, but there was really not a lot of
comfy places to just chill out and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some VIP areas and shit,
but they fill up quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend, Jay and I, Julie,
we found a loading dock area and we made a
[SPEAKER_02]: little dab area for ourselves and got
comfy there and just dabbed out and took a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of selfies and had a good time for a
few.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sunday was a really fun day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more relaxed than Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday was kind of crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hustle and bustly because
everyone's trying to meet up with all
[SPEAKER_02]: their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the first day of school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a lot of those people in
close to a year, if not a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was mostly bumping into friends and
hanging out with Jay until the evening
[SPEAKER_02]: when we headed to the award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the award ceremony was Saturday
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a three day event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm confused by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get fucked up on that all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually you do the awards at the last day,
but they didn't, which we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: something on that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until the award ceremony, the highlight
of my day was probably hanging out and
[SPEAKER_02]: eating lunch with Addison Demora.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lines were really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the food trucks, but there's one
food truck that serves organic gluten-free
[SPEAKER_02]: food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because there's chicken
legs, hot dogs, burgers, French fries,
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of food trucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the middle, there's this one
little baby blue food truck that sells
[SPEAKER_02]: salads for nine bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a salad with some chopped up
strawberries and some blueberries and some
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit that I couldn't identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know what the hell it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the bottom, there were chunks
of feta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every time I stirred it,
I found another layer of goodness in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but there was honey all over it for
dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nine bucks, but that was the most
edible stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a vegetarian and I try to eat well,
so that was the most edible stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that line was two people long.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two people in front of me and I
had my food in less than five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay wanted some food from another cart and
she waited in line for the entire time
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was in line, plus the time that I
ate my food, plus a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people walked by and saw me at a
table and I was sitting at a table where
[SPEAKER_02]: four people could fit and they saw me
there by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, hey dude, can we eat
with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, shit, yeah,
you got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those people ate their meals,
cleaned up after themselves, shook my
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, said goodbye and took off before Jay
even got her food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how long some of the food lines
were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since I'm sitting by the organic food
truck eating my food, my buddy Addison
[SPEAKER_02]: Demora walked up and sat down or ordered
food at the food truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, he came and sat down
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think having lunch with Addie
might've been my highlight of my afternoon
[SPEAKER_02]: up until the award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Addison is a busy man and it seems like
everybody at the Cannabis Cup knew him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting an hour out of his life for him
to just sit down and hang out,
[SPEAKER_02]: not talk business, to just be my bro for
an hour and hang out, catch up was really
[SPEAKER_02]: an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Addison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you get to hear this, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after a bunch of dabs with Addison and
dabs so hard and Julie joined us at the
[SPEAKER_02]: table, we made another friend at the table
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot remember her name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name might've been Elise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name was Elise.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a medical cannabis user and she
uses cannabis for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was just waiting for her friend in
line also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she sat down and ate with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since she ate with me when she was
done, I gave her some dabs just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she really appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I misjudged that lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was, I don't even want to guess how
old she was.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was older than me and she seemed all
nice and kind, but she took a dab like a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have given her larger dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the bunch of dabs and she was
time for the award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: The award ceremony was really neat and
it's kind of chaos like high times always
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made the first award, they made a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced the third place is the
first place and the first place is the
[SPEAKER_02]: third place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was always already chaos,
but that's how high times likes to do
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they finally got their shit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vader won the first three awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that really stood out to me
was when high times brought out two
[SPEAKER_02]: members of the Jamaican Ganja Farmers
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy was, he had short hair and wore a
jacket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other guy was taller and had
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: To his ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the representative of the Rasta
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys spoke about legalization in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they announced that the high times
would be hosting a cannabis cup on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Island of Jamaica in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking about going, but honestly,
I don't know if I want to travel to
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica for a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not be the most financially sound
idea, but you know, you got to do what you
[SPEAKER_02]: got to do sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think about it in a lot of things I'm
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I thought was funny when the
Jamaican came out, the Jamaican guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Rasta started speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, greetings in the name of the most
high, his Imperial Majesty, King Haile
[SPEAKER_02]: Selassie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the first jaw and all of the Rastas
in the room yelled Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guy behind me bumped his buddy on
the shoulder and said, what did he just
[SPEAKER_02]: say?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I jokingly turned back and politely
said, he said, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was pretty funny because the
dude behind me had no idea what this old
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta man just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really excited to see a Rasta man
come out at the cannabis cup and tell me
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's going to be a cannabis cup in
Jamaica in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to see some true Rastas come out and
get to celebrate Rastafari at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cup was nice also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud as fuck to announce that Spencer
and Maddie from the Garden of Whedon won
[SPEAKER_02]: first place for best CBD concentrate at
the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we've had a cannabis cup winner
on this podcast now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first female to come to record at my
house and be on the podcast is also a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cup winner in the CBD extract
category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud as shit for my crew,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that head wound, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't feel good for a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to Spencer's to go kick back,
just to get away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had just made the cup entry and
he's like, try this dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my CBD entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hit it and it tasted like I'd just
bit into oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like I had a mouthful of
delicious sweet oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm drooling now and I kind of want an
orange because of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I blew it out and I had had a
concussion and it felt like I had a belt
[SPEAKER_02]: tied around my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like just pressure around my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I blew out this dab, it felt like you
undid the belt a couple of notches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he gave me a couple of more dabs
and I looked at him and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, I am the most comfortable right now
that I've been in several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was in pain and my head hurt and I
wasn't feeling right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those dabs like set me right,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me, he said, you look like
you're the best you've been in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I guess people could physically see
that I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize I was showing it,
but those dabs were amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely helped me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love to the entire squad at the
Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Mike, Fong, Sloppy, everybody,
Siroc and Nana, everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super fucking proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a chance to visit them since
the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Victory, but I'm sure I'll get them on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence, if you're listening, bro,
you know you got to come be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't even bothered them about it
yet, you guys, because it's only been a
[SPEAKER_02]: few days after the Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's just getting home, getting back
to our normal routines, getting our dogs
[SPEAKER_02]: loved on, getting our plants caught up,
catching up with all of our friends here
[SPEAKER_02]: back where we live and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second place in the same category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of proud of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to our friends, Joey and Shelley
at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs with their CBD entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on a screen far away here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what they entered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause for a second and
I'm going to pull up the winners here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My computer is kind of far out of reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I got the article here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had to reach for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second place winner in the best CBD
concentrate went to Natural Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Caregivers with their Cannatonic,
which actually is a great strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to the episode I did with
Angela about CBD medicine, Cannatonic
[SPEAKER_02]: might've been the culprit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the high CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you the third place,
since we're on the whole category,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was Industrial Hemp CBD Extract with,
oh, that looks crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Iso-Isodial-Isodial-SA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like, it doesn't look like
any cannabis product ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like white powdery substances
that I don't even want to tell you what it
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like drugs, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you showed up with that and you put
that on my table, I'd tell you to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so big shout out to Joey and
Shelley.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I need to give a huge big shout out
to my friend Noah at Champion Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what they actually call
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they go by Champion Cannabis,
but their dispensary one is a different
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scrolling up through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This article is long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you just want me to read all of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go through and read
all of the winners of the 2015 High Times
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Cup in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go kind of quickly.

Times website.

[SPEAKER_02]: You keep hearing me say Colorado N.U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S.

was limited to Colorado dispensaries is
[SPEAKER_02]: how I heard it explained.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best Colorado hybrid flower was,

concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: First place, Strawberry Lemonade Live

Terps.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's another extract ran by a lady right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best edible Bubba Kush Root Beer,
100 milligram from Keef Cola Signature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I find it weird that Keef Cola was a
sponsor and also won first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that that's fucking fair at
all, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't be able to enter and be a
sponsor, is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second place, Afgato Bar from Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a hell of a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promote that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat that, taste good, you'll be high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third place, Orange Cream Sickle Cream Pop
from Sacred Sweets and Tri-Comb Heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: Extracts in a collaboration effort with
DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get to try that, but I have had
other Sacred Sweets products and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: always delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out some stars, some Star of
David shaped products that are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Topical, Angel Salve, Champion
Cannabis with Evo Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are my friends from Las Vegas
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second place, Hygasm, Genesis Compound and
Essences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygasm, the product packages they show
here show that it's an edible personal
[SPEAKER_02]: lubricant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one package that says Hygasm,
and the package has a green logo and it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have a flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one next to it that is yellow or
with a yellow highlighted label,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is labeled Coconut, C-O-C-K-O-Nut,
Coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third product is labeled Hygasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: The label is a little bit purplish and the
flavor is Bloberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are flavored edible personal
lubricants that are infused with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our second place winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third place winner was Floria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we talked about Floria on a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: The packaging says Pleasure with Anne.
[SPEAKER_02]: So best CBD flower was Tora Bora from MMJ
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow the shit out of some Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second place, the Nubia from Aficionado
Freeborn Selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third place, Sleeping Giant from Elemental
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is where we move on to best
CBD concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been here before.
[SPEAKER_02]: First place, OG Tonic from the Smokers
Club in collaboration with the Garden of
[SPEAKER_02]: Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Smokers Club was the sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Garden of Weeden was the grower and
the extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all done by Spence, Matty and the
Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to those guys again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So awesome that they live in my
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put this little town on the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've only lived in Colorado for two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came here with the mission and
they're fucking killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So second place was Kana Tonic from
Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to go to a dispensary for CBD
medicine, I either recommend the Green and
[SPEAKER_02]: Healthy Cannabis or Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only two spots I'd send you
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both medical shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only places to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the third place that is
Industrial Hemp CBD Extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we move on to best CBD edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the honor of meeting the guy from
Fox Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude made a 160 milligram banana
pudding bar in collaboration with Shoemelt
[SPEAKER_02]: and it won first place in the best CBD
edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, I ate three squares of that
thing and it's 160 milligram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's divided into eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not even going to do too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 20, 40, 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate 60 milligrams of that thing and I
was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty high from that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't like high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like rubbery and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was quiet and mellow for most of the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why Saturday was so mellow
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second place was Rocky CBD Enriched
Premium Protein Bar from TC Labs and TC
[SPEAKER_02]: Treats.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third place was Cherry Drop Tincture
from Great Lakes Hemp Supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes on to best booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: First place, Vader Extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second place, RX Green Solution and the
Ethos Collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third place, the Green Solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best product, Moxie Mix from Vader
Extract.

Shatter took first place from the Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second place, Kosher Kush Live Resin
Butter from the Clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet that's delicious because I love
their Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third place, Orange Heroina Shatter from
Native Roots Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, those are all of the winners
from the 2015 High Times US Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me read all those to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a minute and I stumbled a lot,
but I hope you appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me see where I was in my notes
because I just totally got sidetracked and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're like 35 minutes into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fix this microphone so it'll
quit wobbling too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could get my iPhone to unlock,
we could really do a lot more business
[SPEAKER_02]: with this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, dude, that banana pudding edible
that I ate was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only did it wreck me, but it was
amazingly delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they gave me a bunch of those and just
set it next to me, I would be really high
[SPEAKER_02]: because they taste too good to stop
eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to all my friends that got
Cannabis Cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everybody that won a Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be surrounded by cup
winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the Cup Sunday, I was treated to
a super tasty dinner at the Yard House
[SPEAKER_02]: with a few friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Yard House is on the 16th Street Mall
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a super tasty place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vibe's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely go back there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a pizza from there and I also had
the angel hair pasta meal from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Dean is a meat eating heathen.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just picking on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys that eat meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a burger and dude, it looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That burger was like a foot tall off the
plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that dude was able to eat
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned Vader, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about something that I found
kind of disrespectful at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: A company called Vader won several awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won the first three awards that were
given away at the Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a place called Vader Village in
the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a huge setup with a stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had live musical acts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had semi-famous celebrities at the
booths all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Adam Hill was there launching
prizes into the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the t-shirt gun, the t-shirt
cannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would fill it up with packages of
shatter and launch and joints and bags of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and launch bags of weed and shatter
and joints into the crowd of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would go nuts and get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they win best booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won all kinds of prizes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cup happened Sunday or Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was Sunday night when they win
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday is 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's stoked, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We show up for the Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vader Village is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have taken down their entire booth,
tore down everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they win and they just take all their
shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won several awards and they packed up
at night while everyone was asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took off Monday before the Cup
opened at noon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just seems disrespectful to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're going to come to a
competition, if you're going to come to an
[SPEAKER_02]: event and you're going to build a big ass
stage and make a big spectacle,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you win, hang out for the last day
and play with all the cool kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a dick and leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just found that disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even my event, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So congrats on all your wins, Vader,
but that was not a classy move to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This leads me into Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday was day three of the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday was 420 and the place was super
crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather had been sketchy all weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at some points I was wearing a t-shirt
and I was sweating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other times I had a hoodie on
with my hood up and I was freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the weather was super sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday had a nice break in the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it felt like everybody showed up for
the last part of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like around three o'clock it got pretty
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place was stupid crowded for 420,
on 420, at 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got there around lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I milled around and said goodbye to
everyone that I hung out with because I
[SPEAKER_02]: only see a lot of these people once a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these seed companies, all my friends
from the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only meet up like once a year because
this is where everybody is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pretty much said goodbye to everybody
I got to hang out with, went and visited a
[SPEAKER_02]: few booths, picked up a couple of pieces
of merchandise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly, the only thing I really
bought, oh man, I got to give a huge shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I write this down?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all my other notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll skip that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got more notes to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just milled around, said goodbye to
everybody, ate some food, got dabbed out,
[SPEAKER_02]: gave everybody a bunch of hugs,
hung out with Jules, hung out with Dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to hang out with Addison, Gage Green,
Mr. Spliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saw a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saw a lot of cool ass people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't really describe it other than
it was an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a state fair or any
other trade show, but add the best
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and extracts on the planet and
then a thousand of your favorite friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what the cup is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Aaron Brooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost forgot that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not write that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pleasant surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Aaron Brooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does some neat shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was Monday at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the cup, I headed to the Mellow
Mushroom to meet up with a few friends of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine because Doug Benson was in town doing
a comedy show at ComedyWorks, recording
[SPEAKER_02]: his next comedy special that he has
titled, what the hell did he call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Promotional Tool is the name of his new
album.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to see him record that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of got some hookups at the
ComedyWorks, so I might've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting right in the front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to ComedyWorks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the whole ComedyWorks crew
for treating me like royalty every time I
[SPEAKER_02]: go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to leave you guys off on my
Cannabis Cup recap by saying that it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great seeing everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if I got to see you there,
thanks for shaking my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for walking up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for talking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for meeting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of gifts here that I
should talk about, but I'm going to wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: up this part and we're going to move on to
a couple of the things my friend Clint
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been on the show is going to show
up tomorrow night and record with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will talk about our experience at
the Doug Benson Comedy Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will also talk about a,
we saw Greg Proops record a podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday night at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also got to hang out with Greg
Proops and in Guy Obelam after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll talk about that with Clint on the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, I got to jump back to the notes
so I don't skip anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the next part that I want to
do is I'm going to do a couple shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Josh, my friend Josh won second place
in the Adam Dunn Show Invitational,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was kind of a private grow
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh, dude, huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you listened to the
episode or the podcast, like every episode
[SPEAKER_02]: religiously, but when you finally do hear
this, cause I'm sure you're behind,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you finally hear this, dude,
huge shout out and congrats for winning at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took second place, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was his first competition he's ever
entered and he took second place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the dude's killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should be proud of himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got that covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, take dabs and review them.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the part I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it pays to be Rasta Jeff and
have a little podcast because while I was
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Cannabis Cup, somebody walked up to
me and this happened two days in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: He walked up to me and he handed me these
little packages and it says Electrum
[SPEAKER_02]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to pull this whole thing
out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hard to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in little smelly proof bags and
it's got the smelly proof logo right over
[SPEAKER_02]: his logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take it out so I can see
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Electrum Extracts and you unfold
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other side, it says Lemon Skunk x
Banana Kush contains 100% organic
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole plant extracted via N-butane
N-propane mix in a closed-loop extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his Instagram, check this out,
is Electrum Extracts, E-L-E-C-T-R-U-M
[SPEAKER_02]: Extracts on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it says not for use by children.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what he gave me here, he handed me some
butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite thing, some BHO, some dabs,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he said was, I want you to try
this on the show and let me know what you
[SPEAKER_02]: think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try the Lemon Skunk x Banana
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reaching for all my tools right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cleaning off the carb cap,
unwrapping the parchment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice, friendly portion he gave me
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already dabbed a few dabs,
so I don't remember what it weighed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm going to take a decent size dab
here and then we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Electrum Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Lemon Skunk x Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dab with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got some dabs, dab with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, two, one, dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it tastes good on the way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually you don't taste good smoke until
the way out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tastes citrusy and lemony on the way
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely taste the lemons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't taste the Banana Kush part,
but I taste the Lemon Skunk for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's something I noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these Lemon Skunk strains,
I've got a Lemon Skunk plant that I bred
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Golden Goat made Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I make dabs out of the Lemon
Skunk or the Lemon Jeffrey, it makes my
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes bounce up and down a little bit for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're driving down a fucked up,
graded dirt road and your eyes just go...
[SPEAKER_02]: This Lemon Skunk Banana Kush dab just made
my eyes do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good sativa high from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Electrum Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do approve of your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take dabs of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's available somewhere,
I want some more of that Lemon Skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for giving me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just walked up to me and he's like,
my friend said he had a podcast and I
[SPEAKER_02]: should give this to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please review it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit works out sometimes when you're off
to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me another one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we try it on the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be silly not to, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is Rare Dankness Sativa Blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one is just going to be straight
ahead, Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried this one yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfolding it, looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sticking to the parchment a little
more than the other one did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but it's got a nice amber-y color to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smelling it off the parchment here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got an odd flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a lime, more lime than what I'm
used to in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to get a nice
flavor out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, guys, join me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you got a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Sativa Blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contains 100% organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Whole Plant Extracted Via.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Whole Plant, does that mean that you
just cut the buds off the sticks and do
[SPEAKER_02]: like fan leaves and nugs all at once?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do that with my CBD medicine so
you get that full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just curious what that Whole Plant they're
hinting at there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a dab with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lime flavor catches me, but
[SPEAKER_02]: this one's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's Sativa too because my head is
just going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely both of those were smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them had a nice texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them were well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too much of a lime flavor on this
Rare Dakeness one for me, but that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, that's a great hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I don't give this one a
perfect 10 is because the lime thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: not my flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange flavored one or the lemony
flavored one wins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do give you a thumbs up on both of
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, Electrum Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys win, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took care of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for giving me hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you guys gave me hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when people walk up to me and give
me stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about the Edibles I ate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to a comedy show and we're going
to talk about that more, but I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: give a shout out while I'm thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw Doug Benson Monday night on my
way into the show, I ate a Claude Berry
[SPEAKER_02]: because my friend Claude the Candy Man
from Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Claude gave me a banana Claude Berry that
was dipped in chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know me, you know I freaking
love banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also know that I love chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a hundred milligram edible that was
banana flavored dipped in chocolate was
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect fucking gift for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Claude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Sweet Stone Candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That edible worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super stoned and super smiley for
the whole comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Wednesday night, I saw Greg Proops and
I ate a 100 milligram watermelon candy for
[SPEAKER_02]: adult use only.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Indica on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says contains two pieces at 50
milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what these guys didn't do,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not put any sort of branding on
here, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hit Instagram right
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see if I have the message
where he asked me if I ate the edible yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, I found him.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Ryan is made of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this dude gave me this edible and it's
a Lego man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually two Lego man, 50
milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ate both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at dinner at the Mellow Mushroom
and I tore them open while I was waiting
[SPEAKER_02]: for the pizza to come and ate these
suckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually don't eat gummies just because
of, I'm just a picky sucker when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to my diet, but these are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: The watermelon candy flavor was pretty
damn good and I liked them and I was dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely high for the whole comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smiled like a child for the whole show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Ryan is made of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks for the edibles that you gave
me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it very, very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go look at the notes again,
because I've got ADD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going like 47 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, the next episode will be Clint and I
talking about the comedy shows that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: recently gone to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am working on the Grow Room schedule
episode that I prepared for Hygro's
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting, which is not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention that again, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: 47 minutes in, the meeting at Hygro and
their growing supplies has been postponed
[SPEAKER_02]: to a better time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will let you know when the better time
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to do that in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have another episode on improving
your crop real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also have episodes with Jesse doing
outdoor stuff and more organics with Sean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get some shout outs done and
let's get out of here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a big shout out to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a huge shout out to Julie.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Julie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out with me at the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I owe a huge shout out to Dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, shout out to Kelso Marley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, everyone who complimented on the
podcast at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, everybody who walked up and gave me
a high five, shook my hand, gave me a hug,
[SPEAKER_02]: any sort of compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you people that said what's up at
the Cannabis Cup, I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Oil Slick for the sweet new
hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks fresh on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Selco Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe you a huge shout out for the sick
new Pindi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing looks really stylish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matches my new hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Task Rock for the hookups and
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a sweet new nail.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Danny Danko.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Bobby Black.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to skip a lot of buddy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Skye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I can't think of his name right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm drawing a complete fucking blank on
Mike's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Hughes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I just forgot your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Mike Hughes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everybody from the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that cleaned up after us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place was a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time you guys pick up four pieces of
trash, if they're yours or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I met a ton of cool people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did meet a lot of tons of cool
people, but, and this is serious,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the coolest folks that I met were
my friends Deez and Gore, also known as
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian and Jen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pleasure to meet both you guys,
and I wish you a beautiful future
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're my friends from a chat room,
oddly enough, and I've never met them in
[SPEAKER_02]: person, but I met them in person for the
very first time at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were cooler than I ever expected or
could have imagined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, it's been 49 minutes.

[SPEAKER_02]: This will be like the first or the 29th or

[SPEAKER_03]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey everybody, just so you know,
Mother's Day, May 10th.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fucking forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You love her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a fat dad, give your mom a hug for
me, and on Mother's Day, buy the bitch
[SPEAKER_02]: some flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm helping out every single one of us
stoner boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh shit, I would have forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you guys already have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good heads up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be out before Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, don't forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my sponsor is your mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who I'm trying to get to promote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my mom, your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, hey, Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's already an awkward start.
[SPEAKER_02]: May 10th is Mother's Day and we get to
brag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what we're doing May 10th,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know what we're doing May 10th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint and I will be seeing Doug Benson
hosting his podcast, Doug Loves Movies,
[SPEAKER_02]: at ComedyWorks, my favorite comedy club on
the damn planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only comedy club that's worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're going to a different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one we go to will be worth a
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Denver Improv, so I have to
back that place up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place was fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: ComedyWorks is my favorite comedy club on
the planet that I've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to see Doug Benson there May 10th,
recording his podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Loves Movies, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are into Doug Benson,
check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to give you a quick apology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the growers meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had very short notice that that was not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growers meeting didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys showed up, I'm in my house
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the time of the meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here recording, taking dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 7.10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when the meeting should be
happening, but I got some free time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came here and recorded a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't work for High Grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just simply trying to help them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why they couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everything is cool with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Burn, everybody at High
Grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn and Jesse, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get another meeting together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't do this to you guys again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get on with what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Benson, we get to see him May 10th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start it off by saying this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope he does a better show than
he did when we saw him Monday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff came up as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to my buddy, Drew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he'll be listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, shout out to my friend, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up realizing I had a plus one
available for the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called her about two and a half
hours before the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, if you can get your cute
little ass to Denver- From Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Pueblo to the restaurant where we're
all going to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will order you food and have a plate of
food waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you get there, you can grub
down and we got to get to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told her, please be here by this
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she made it five minutes early,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to a girl that got ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got herself beautiful and drove to Denver
in two and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you got to come to the show with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and also shout out to your friend that
you brought with us, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Drew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I got to meet him and he
seems like a fun guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have common friends, so we're
definitely going to hang out and take some
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys were talking about him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's Pueblo too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the same thing as like,
I just, we're one degree of separation
[SPEAKER_03]: from everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: One degree of Kevin Bacon from every
single person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Drew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good meeting you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to hang out and
take some dabs together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the picture of Drew's car right
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you took a little nappy poo,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fortunately it was after the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Drew, you did pass the fuck out and it
was hilarious to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, he kept, he kept like trying
to like lay over onto me as I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept having to like shove him back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like get over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or finish the job you started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck my dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your car has got those big couch seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure he was just thinking he's
cuddled up on the couch with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most comfortable seats you've
ever ridden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: His car is a boat, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could go on a cruise in Clint's car.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody coming out for the cruise.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be going May 10th, Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no cruise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we got to see Doug and we were-
Front row.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to the Mellow
Mushroom and Kelso Marley.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made friends with this lovely
waitress at the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a fellow grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is an extract artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a fucking cool dog named Zephyr.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Kelso.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Zephyr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you guys are doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you are listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me, she told me that they
listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope they're checking it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not only an awesome waitress,
but she's a cool lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking to her on Instagram and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: She seems like a great chick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out that Mellow Mushroom too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place is delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's a carnivore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or carnivorous meat eating freak over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a scrawny pussy hippie
vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can agree with that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying nothing, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a meal on that menu for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm completely satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint is satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sit across the table from each other
and belittle each other's food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all the grease coming off your
meat pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: You carnivore piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all the shit that you should feed
my food.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So huge shout out to The Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can go on to the Doug Benson
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: We owe a shout out to Baker and
ComedyWorks also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to have some VIP preferred
seating status at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I let them know I'm coming in
advance, they will get me some VIP seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were front fucking row for Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to see him record his comedy special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the third time they had done that
show that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get on with that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show opened with Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you feel about Graham Elwood,
dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Graham Elwood was one of the funniest guys
I've seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I was really fucking high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't remember a lot of what he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would zone out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he'd go on some ramps and I'd just
start zoning out fucking high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, man, it would be cool to see
like what the inside of a rainbow looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was still talking about something like
his kid or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just went to the extra happy place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked over a couple of times and I
could tell you were zoned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Graham Elwood's hilarious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a fake band known as the
Whistling Banes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to that Doug Benson podcast,
you will hear some Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also got his own podcast called The
Comedy Film Nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Graham actually invited me to the LA
Podfest in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me that there is a big room
where you can set up and everybody records
[SPEAKER_02]: their podcast out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that if I come, he would be on
my show and he shook my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I make it to LA Podfest,
you guys will hear Graham Elwood on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I can't keep it in check
tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said the F-bomb probably 15 times
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, he said it so quietly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Graham amazed me because he was funny
and he was clean, which is hard to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like just more props to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he would ever listen to this,
I hope he would hear us say that he was
[SPEAKER_03]: the best part of that night because Doug
Benson came on after him and Doug,
[SPEAKER_03]: first thing he said, he goes, I woke up
this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this was on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, yeah, let's remind the people
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he woke up, he started smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a 420 show up till he was,
he was smoking up until then.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just kept smoking all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first thing he said is
like he did all he could do to make it to
[SPEAKER_03]: where he couldn't make it to that last
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His goal was to be too high to record that
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he succeeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've seen, I've gotten Doug
Benson high several times and I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: seen him that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got high, and this sounds like bragging,
but I'm kind of, I'm not bros with Doug,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm internet buddies with Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Twitter friends with Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the comedians know who I am by
now because I've gone to enough shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he relies on Rasta Jeff to get him high
before the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows I've got some dank weed and I'm
not psycho.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he hits me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hit me up to get him high.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I got him high and he told me
from the stage, he fucked up a joke and
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at me and said, you got me too
high, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That night he was three or four times
beyond that level of high.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was so fucking skinny eyed,
fucking, you could not see.
[SPEAKER_03]: One eye was skinny, one eye was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one eye was working, kind of,
but it was fucking, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was so baked that he just, it just
wasn't even that much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kept putting his head on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys heard this sound a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was his head hitting the
microphone so that he could take a little
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was, I mean, and he was laughing at his
own jokes and there was some really
[SPEAKER_03]: hilarious shit that he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: He spent 30 minutes reading fucking
tweets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first 30 minutes of his show,
he read tweets, which he usually spends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem was that 30 minutes was
only divided up by like five tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like a whole bunch of tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like five people that were
audacious enough to pull their phone out
[SPEAKER_03]: in a comedy show and send him a shout out
or, and tweet at him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, we're up front row.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that looks, he would have,
Graham was staring at me because my phone
[SPEAKER_02]: was on my lap because it's too big for my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this iPhone six plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my phone was on my lap and Graham kept
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like grandma would looked at my
phone twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's got his fucking phone out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then maybe if it was on your lap,
he was looking at something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he looking at my package, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You think Graham was checking it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was trying to see if he got any seeds
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I got plenty of seeds, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is team I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Doug Benson literally yawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to move the mic from his face and
yawn on stage performing his comedy
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually said, this is my third time
recording this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to do is make sure to get
the jokes that I didn't get perfect the
[SPEAKER_02]: last couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now don't, don't let me say anything
other than I respect them for being
[SPEAKER_03]: honest, but I just didn't pay to go see a
guy just kind of muddle through something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to see a concert, I don't want
to watch Metallica do soundcheck five
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I picked Metallica.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that would be, well, I mean,
maybe I want to watch them nail inner
[SPEAKER_02]: sand, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to watch him try to do some
song they haven't done right in a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't played this song properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try it in front of you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, I mean, Doug only did things,
I guess he did things three times that day
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a couple of the bits twice because
he forgot he did one when he was doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it's because he broke it off early in
the first part.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't tell like the same part of the
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: How high were we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that was because he had a pocket
full of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That were disheveled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like, it looks like your grandpa
had gone to Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when grandpa comes home from
going out all day, he's got a pocket full
[SPEAKER_02]: of receipts and a couple of breath mints
and a fucking toothpick and like a
[SPEAKER_02]: shopping list.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now grandpa's got a joint in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he had, there's like four or five
different colors of pieces of paper in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a receipt for Barnes and Noble
in there that I could see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he had scribbled on all of
it, but that's where his notes were.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in that handful of grandpa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kept staring at all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handful of Grandpa is also the name of my
new metal band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we write that down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have, I have a use for the name
Handful of Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another project needs a name and if you're
not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make something out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, make sure you listen to my other
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Handful of Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been put out yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint Stewart's the first guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may just be an episode, but still
this, that needs to be written down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry if I'm wasting time writing
down this phrase, Handful of Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have made it this far into
this podcast, we salute you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second of all, you know, we're probably
not going to be talking too much about
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on this one, but the next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing as people though.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I, now I remember why I forget to
bring comedians in the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the shit that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the listeners like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't always have to be intense grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle, you could put your notebook
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be nothing to write down this
time other than the phrase Handful of
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_03]: We win.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, but, so we had those
disheveled notes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's where we were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he just.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he needs glasses to go with
the notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dude, he definitely needed to open his
eyes a little bit because they were
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody threw a joint on stage and it
took him two minutes to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was waiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've ever seen the comedy works
like stage, it's well lit and it's maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: the size of your kitchen table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's not a big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was nothing on the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a blue carpet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did somebody say the floor looked
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody tweeted and said the floor looked
like a nail or a salon floor, a day spa
[SPEAKER_02]: floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, it was vacuumed beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, no, but it was just like 30
minutes on five tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got into some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he tried to do like other tweets
or something like later in the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't he?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't he doing tweet relief?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called watch this, not that is a game
that he plays on his show where he lets
[SPEAKER_02]: the audience members select movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he decides which one to watch,
but he was too high to keep track of what
[SPEAKER_02]: the other audience members were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was the things called promotional
tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, we definitely felt like we got
used like a tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just, it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt a little like, like, you know what
guys, it sucks to be you, but this is
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's the way it has to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we all were talking about it later,
I was like, so what'd you guys think?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just waiting for someone to be
like, that was kind of fucking whack for
[SPEAKER_02]: my 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like you went and hung out with Doug
and then me and my boy Drew took off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all stupidly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were three carloads of people from
Pueblo with one or two people in each car
[SPEAKER_02]: because we didn't plan that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had come from the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You came up on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I invited Danielle right after
you left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was already in monument by the time she
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I'm proud of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: She made that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so we all had to get in separate
cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we linked up and talked about it,
it was like, yeah, I felt like we kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: were his guinea pigs or his test audience
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: He saved the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug, I'm not being disrespectful to you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like that third show,
man, you were too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I wasn't, I'm like a loyal Doug
fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of neat for me to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've seen enough Doug, that's why I'm
watching my friend do comedy now,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, VIP seats and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I was a normal civilian listener,
I might not have been impressed with that
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I told you, the only
interaction I've had with them is just
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to Doug loves movies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's not a whole lot of Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched Doug's specials before.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first chance of seeing Doug
Benson.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was not impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it on the podcast before that I
think maybe Doug's excessive cannabis use
[SPEAKER_02]: may be slowing down his comedy and his
career.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that our experience solidifies
my theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sucks because cannabis shouldn't
be used as a slowing down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be used as a way to move
yourself forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then real quick, and we didn't bring
this up before, but when there was that,
[SPEAKER_03]: he said, we're all going to go smoke
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was what, like a hundred people?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like a hundred people in that
alleyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys have ever seen
the ComedyWorks Alleyway, but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably 30 feet wide, maybe about 10
yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just trying to give it a little
bit of room because- A car and a person on
[SPEAKER_02]: either side of the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say it's 10 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if a car goes down there,
we all got to squeeze against the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll say 10 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was like 75 to 100 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of people in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it started feeling real gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're outside in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like, no, this isn't the
attitude I want to have around weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like we were taking tequila
shots and everybody was high fiving over
[SPEAKER_02]: the tequila shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it got that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I felt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that I didn't stick around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, Doug usually hangs out and
smokes with everybody, but he smoked with
[SPEAKER_02]: a few people and then he knows me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually turned to me and he said,
hey, Rasta Jeff, how are you, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how was your drive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he knows I drive far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the crowd saw him, heard him
address me, they fucking separated and let
[SPEAKER_02]: him and I kind of hang out and take some
pictures and chill for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he shook my hand and left.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wandered off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there were still a lot of people
there and he left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw Ngaio at that point, Ngaio
Bielam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you know Ngaio, check him
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is hard to spell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's N-G-A-I-O-420, Ngaio420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check him out on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a jack of all trades, but he's
definitely a pot smoker and a pot
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bumped into Ngaio.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been Twitter friends and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been in the same area, same industry
for a long time, but I finally bumped into
[SPEAKER_02]: the dude and made friends with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He followed me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: He followed our friend on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought that was the end of my
meeting with Ngaio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we had met and shook hands and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody went our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint drove home, like you said,
because he was tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously Drew needed a nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made it 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made sure Danielle got to her car safely
and we all headed back south to the lovely
[SPEAKER_02]: city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday, I had to drive almost all the way
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove up to the North End of Springs to
meet up with some friends for some food
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're leaving back to Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to introduce our friend Danielle to
our friend, my friend Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been Twitter and Instagram friends
for a long time and they finally got to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put them two chicks in a parking lot,
let them hula hoop together for a minute
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got to make some friends out of
those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to them two ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Wednesday, Clint met me at my house
right around 420-ish and then we boogied
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go see Mr. Greg Proops record the
World's Smartest Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may lose some of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys may like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, I could tell that Clint was a
little bit lost during the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was either lost or it was just,
I don't know, he gets a little ranty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, he calls that the boring
preachy part of his show.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good portion of his show,
apparently, because there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: preachy parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some joke parts of the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just take a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got like a lot of references and
stuff that just, it just takes a while to
[SPEAKER_03]: get to things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of a, you know, let me hit you
with the left and a right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, his comedy, he's doing... No,
he's a smart guy and I like the guy and
[SPEAKER_03]: he's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the jokes he had were really
funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just takes a little while to get there,
but I'm pretty sure he's like improving
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that was improv.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday was the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday, Friday and Saturday,
he's doing standup, which will be
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different than what you saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing is like improv is a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I do standup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do improv and it's nothing against
improv.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know those skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those guys are better at many,
many things, but I think just getting to
[SPEAKER_03]: the joke and keeping people laughing,
that's where standup reigns and keeping
[SPEAKER_03]: you engaged and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, improv is kind of like, well,
let's try to figure out how do we get back
[SPEAKER_03]: to this like neutral points or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way we can make it funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those guys, that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the audience is a little bit more,
gives you more leeway with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you guys know when the podcast
were giving him more leeway than I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not there just for the funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm expecting to be enlightened a little
by Greg, educated, slightly offended at
[SPEAKER_02]: some points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's a thinking man's comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls himself the world's smartest man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a smart dude though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a smart sucker and he's been doing
improv.
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked him how long you've been doing
comedy and he just shook his head at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he just wanted to say like longer
than you've been alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't trying to say like,
oh, how long you've been, I was just
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to ask him like, well,
how long, you know, this is like a goal of
[SPEAKER_03]: mine to be you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kind of did kind of just dismiss me
as though I was saying it like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I meant like was all respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know that there is the
possibility that in like you've been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it takes to get to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys, he's the one from Whose Line
Is It Anyway?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the shows that this guy is
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's no offense to Greg, but he's probably
the one that you call the gay one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a beautiful wife named Jennifer
and he is completely straight and he
[SPEAKER_02]: stands up for women's rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just got like a little bit of a high
irritating voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't mean like super irritating,
but it's just like, I probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to marry you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm all right with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: His voice made it to where I didn't want
to marry him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else about that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wears a suit all of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a suit with kind of a blueish
jacket with a purple shirt underneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a purple hanky in one pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point he pulled out a hanky out
of his jacket pocket to do a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hanky out of his pocket was
perfectly pressed and it was purple and it
[SPEAKER_02]: had gold pinstriping on it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: His pocket hanky was fucking stylish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this dude is stylish from head to
toe.
[SPEAKER_02]: His shoes were sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that shocked me about the
man was, so we saw him record a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: While he's recording the show,
I look to the right and I see Engayo
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting backstage at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, we're going to hang out
with Engayo and Greg, watch this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the show, we get bustled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a couple of times of me looking
over at Clint and he's looking like he's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also shout out to our friend Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Joe met up with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And joined us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost left Joe out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe joined us for the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe was a huge Proops fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked over and Clint's kind of
fallen asleep a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the show, we're looking for
the guys and we can't find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a friend of mine is like, dude,
they're down here in this area smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just walk back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walked back there and I could hear
Engayo from a block away.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a very recognizable voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we walked down the stairs and they're
just hanging out smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Engayo greets me and knew my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I introduced myself to Greg
Proops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sticks out his hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shake hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked if we're interrupting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, no, I lit a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just what I felt like needed to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we started hanging out with these
guys for, we hung out for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, about an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I was going to say,
what I led onto was the thing that shocked
[SPEAKER_02]: me about Greg, he smokes cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have guessed Greg Proops
smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have thought that he was smarter
than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing against you cigarette smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, cause I have just recently finally
got, I quit my e-cig too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit all that nicotine shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just doing weed now, which,
you know, hit and miss.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing or a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's better for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's better for me, but it could
also give me fire for my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's name is not Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Bobby McGee here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Bob McGee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, no, I understand cutting
cigarettes out is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Greg Proops doing it, it just,
it was like, wow, that was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it stunk too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so weird that I could smell his
cigarette worse than I could smell all the
[SPEAKER_02]: dankness around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Engayo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pulled out some Tangy from Cali that
had some stink and some flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Tangy was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get the chance to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smelt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was already too high by the time he had
pulled that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smelt it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my Platin Emoji trumped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him the last of my Platin Emoji
that I had with me and he looked quite
[SPEAKER_02]: impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a nice guy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Engayo is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked with these guys for like an hour
and they were talking to us, not at us,
[SPEAKER_02]: not about us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were just hanging out with normal
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, Greg Proops was telling a
baseball story, go figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know anything about Proops,
you know he's a huge baseball fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was talking about a player leading
off of first base in a celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the umpire yelled, play ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy just stayed way off of first
base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first baseman reaches over with
the ball and tags him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as he talks about tagging him out,
he damn near punched me in the titty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he tagged me out as like a
physical act to show what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was being cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he was just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that story was the Kansas City Royals
own George Brett for all the Stoner
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking baseball fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the story that we were being
told.
[SPEAKER_03]: 3,000th hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look it up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was celebrating his 3,000th hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so when Proops was acting out the
smack, he smacked me and looked at me like
[SPEAKER_02]: I was his buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried not to light up like a school
girl because I was stupid excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought I was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg Proops is one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a comedy nerd and he's a comedy
legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a podcaster and he's got a great
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's articulate and he makes me speak
and write better.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually makes me more conscious of my
vocabulary and my mouth when I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm not super dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some really funny parts to Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: But between the shows, I had a rough
weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Graham Elliott, that was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elwood, Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graham Elwood, as I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, just like you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't recorded or anything, was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nobody will also hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Graham was my favorite of the
little excursion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint is kind of owed a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got comedy blue balls right now,
I'd assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little comedy tug.
[SPEAKER_02]: May 10th, that'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: May 10th, that'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: May 10th, that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe when Guy will come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that would be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool to see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to know who was going to be on
that, but I'm going to have my name tag
[SPEAKER_03]: ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to take my old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a name tag made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you don't know what we're talking
about, when you go see Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_02]: do Doug loves movies, you got to take a
name tag with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to take my old name
tag or if I want to print up a new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just take your old one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you be me.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, you're the laziest motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got Doug loves movies on May
10th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey Diaz coming up after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's June.
[SPEAKER_02]: In June.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what else do we have coming up?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brian Callan show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it sounds like I'm going to see
Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I got to start listening to more
Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can take somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I'm all about seeing some
Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fighter in the kid, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's going to be fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing is it's just fun going.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing is I'm not going to
complain about these couple of days
[SPEAKER_03]: because they were fun days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny that I can still be a
little bit like, it wasn't that great,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we hung out with Proops and Nungayo
for a fucking hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for an hour and just spoke like
bros.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what the hell I'm
complaining about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could have probably smoked with
Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't feel like hopping in that
crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was a big crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to see Doug here in like
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything's good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother's Day, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we mentioned the Mother's Day?
[SPEAKER_02]: How high are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that opener?
[SPEAKER_03]: That cold open fucking from Clint?
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything else you want to add
about the comedy shows before we start
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapping it up and moving on to different
subjects?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, ComedyWorks is one of the best
clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't been there, please go check
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter who you go see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have great service there all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got waitresses running all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with us, you know, we're doing every
Thursday down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to see open mic comedy,
we're still doing that every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Rainbow on Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, I know I keep talking about
being VIP at ComedyWorks and they treat me
[SPEAKER_02]: like a pimp.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will treat you like a pimp as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They treat everybody like a rock star
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just 6'5 with dreadlocks and they
recognize my high ass every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they remember me and I've made friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're coming back kind of,
you know, frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fairly frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bring dank, dank weed and I might
smoke out in the back every time and they
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might smell you coming before they
see your fucking 6'5 Ross to fucking ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's fun when you take a date
with you who's never really hung out with
[SPEAKER_02]: you out in public a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you take her to a comedy show and
everybody at the ComedyWorks, 125 miles
[SPEAKER_02]: from your house, high fives you and knows
you by name.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The comedians know you by name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a way to take a chick out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I do want to go to the Cannes Cup
with you next year though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you do because- Oh,
I ain't smoking a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just saying every 10 feet it's,
I get stopped and start a new conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: every 10 feet, every 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a bag over your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw some dreadlocks on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll think that I am you because we're
about the same height.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are close to the same height,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be my brother, my brother from
another mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just, I'll just kind of be like,
yeah, man, like, no, I'm just really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just won't even open my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have sunglasses anyway,
if you're being me.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, here we go, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys, next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just need an iRegionX shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to send around a drone of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me so that I can go kick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still, he's still running around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take breaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on and off on shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be me for five hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the morning shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be good in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no people out there in the
mornings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take that shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of people out there in the
mornings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy this time in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess you said that on the last
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you talked about it on the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just how busy it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people are running around.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were thousands of people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never looked for the official ticket
sales to see how many people were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good on that one, but thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that I did not get to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just tried to pass me a bowl of flowers
and I turned it down because flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: really give me stupid bad cotton mouth on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a dab though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said Thursday's at the Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday at the Rainbow Bar, 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Wild Cousins, just trying to
keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's tough because we're not in
the big city doing the big boy shows and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, my boy John Blano is starting to take
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really given 100% to it.
Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that he's going to be one
of the first guys out of Pueblo to really,
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good guy and he wants it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw his post about doing some show where
he's hosting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was proud of him for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think he's going up to Longmont to
host some, I don't remember who it was
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a cover charge for your show on
Thursdays at the Rainbow?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rainbow is free every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come see some free comedy, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open micers, but we might get some
weird shit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything should have worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything's cool still happening.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those shows are going to be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open micers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't miss shit, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to go back and look
because that's got me sketched out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I hope all that recorded,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to part two because we just
recorded part one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like everything worked,
but I can tell the garage band was pissed
[SPEAKER_02]: off at me for a second there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an update on the computer and
everything's still kind of wonky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm about to take this dab is
what I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The free shows, you'll see some open
micers there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who will we see at these open mic events
on a Thursday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you think will show up?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a lot of guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself, I'm going to get back after it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a little bit of a break,
but I got to get back after it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then my boy, Paul Rosales, he's there
every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really funny guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys listened to the episode 62,
Wild Cousins, he was the funny one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the funny one that's looking for a
dude to hook up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we had a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Bueno's, like I said, really,
really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got other guys coming through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's brand new guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a brand new guy and you want to
try comedy, there's no better place than
[SPEAKER_03]: the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or brand new gal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or yeah, please, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say dude, I mean guy and gal.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say guy, I just mean anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't mean it as like only guys
can do whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish more ladies had come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, maybe I'm intimidating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm six foot five, four foot dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should see Clint's dreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're intimidating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get no dread cred.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other shows coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any specific dates?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taking your mom out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't mean that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take your mom out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your own mothers out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take them to dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it on the ninth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys follow Clint on
Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: At tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hasn't been posting a lot lately,
but he's getting back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took kind of a hiatus to get his shit
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the social media takes a lot of your
damn time, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I post a lot and then I catch myself
like, oh, I've been on here for 30
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wipe and get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see that coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either did I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either did I.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you probed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to wrap up this show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you for coming to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out with me at comedy
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for all the shows we have planned
together in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Tall Guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet at us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was a little rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of rambly, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you got to cut loose and have a
comedy show instead of all about uptight
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure you guys are getting a lot
of weed anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you made it this far, good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you clean the filters in your
air conditioners and calibrate your pH
[SPEAKER_02]: meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some weed advice for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also make sure that they don't have
centipedes because those are scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it from Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centipedes are scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be back in a few days with
another
[SPEAKER_02]: video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in
[SPEAKER_02]: a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and right now it's flashing at 852.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's jumping between 850 and 852.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if you tried to take a dab
with that at 852 degrees, I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: that'd be too hot, but that is not a
representation of degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is simply a setting on the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that, and maybe there is one
brand, maybe one or two brands that does
[SPEAKER_02]: this, but I don't think that that coil is
sending the temperature to that nail and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way back to there and telling it
that it's 860 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is more of a setting like if you turn
your volume on your car stereo to 11,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not putting out 11 anythings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just on 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that my car stereo, I can crank it
up to about 28 before the subwoofer starts
[SPEAKER_02]: sounding like complete crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that 26 is my ideal temp on my
car stereo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean I'm putting out 26
anything in particulars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the level where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I think your emails are
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have established that the 860 I'm
seeing on my screen right now on my LED is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a frequency that is being put
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's being measured by that
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to keep in mind that that
number has to travel all the way down the
[SPEAKER_02]: cord, and then it has to get to the coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that coil is the heating part.
[SPEAKER_02]: That coil has to heat whatever type of
nail you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using this new highly educated,
it's the e-nail insert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the name printed on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew the name until I started talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the HED.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm using that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to heat up this
barrel-shaped piece, and then the head of
[SPEAKER_02]: the nail heats up after that because the
heat's got to travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for it to know what the exact heat is
on the head of that nail would be kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous to ask of that device.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point is that number doesn't match
the head of the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a frequency or a dial setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you find the ideal number,
just remember that ideal number,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's kind of where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not actually getting an 840.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 56 degrees, or I've seen some of them
set at perfectly 710 because people think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the perfect temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That number is not correlating to the
nail, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see my pictures and it's 850,
quit bitching at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's my point here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another topic written down,
but the iPhone has locked me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the pesticide issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we talked about this a little bit in
a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about some of the dispensaries
that got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw a quick article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scrolling through my phone here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have been a little more prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are kind of upset about this
pesticide issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is what I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was all over social media websites
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Pesticide violations were issued
to the following recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it lists Mindful, Green
Solutions, Evolutionary Holdings,
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Cross Colorado, MMJ America,
Organic Greens, Altitude East Treatments,
[SPEAKER_02]: RINO, and Sweetleaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: All violators were using Eagle 20 and
petroleum-based fungicide that is harmful
[SPEAKER_02]: to humans and animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Altitude East Treatments was also using
Mallet and Abbott, both harmful to humans
[SPEAKER_02]: and animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Cross Denver was also using Mallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of these violations are well-known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes on to talk about a lot
more stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know the original source
of that because I've seen it cut and
[SPEAKER_02]: pasted on so many different social media
sites that I don't know who to give credit
[SPEAKER_02]: to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these guys were spraying Eagle 20 on
plants and then selling those buds to
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the weird part here is MMJ America
just won a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are, did they enter their Eagle
20 laden buds into the cannabis cup or are
[SPEAKER_02]: they growing separate cups?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or separate crops and entering that and
not even giving the public a chance to go
[SPEAKER_02]: buy that because I suspect that that's
what some of the shops do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these plants have been taken off the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants will never make it to harvest
and those buds will never be sold to
[SPEAKER_02]: customers or patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure that there was medicine or
product that did make it out of the door
[SPEAKER_02]: and has been treated with Eagle 20 or
whatever else they were listing here that
[SPEAKER_02]: we definitely should not be consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If these were tomatoes and they just
discovered that these people had been
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying tomatoes with these products,
the tomato farmer or distributor or
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever's in charge at that point would
have to go make some sort of a press
[SPEAKER_02]: release and apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have to be held accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would have been a much larger deal if
this would have been another agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: product or a horticultural product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's ridiculous is the cannabis
industry makes so much money that they
[SPEAKER_02]: should have been kind of on top of this
and been doing the right thing anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're getting illegal cannabis here
and then we're trying to set the pace here
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they're going to go and do shit
like this, which really puts, I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know, kind of a black eye on the legal
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the people that were leading
the industry should have been more
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible with our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't say to not shop at those stores
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what you want to do, but I would
definitely pay more attention to where my
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would pay more attention to what's
going in my medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the more reason you guys to grow your
own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple of more notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I want?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get on to, actually,
let's just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about grow room scheduling,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 10 minutes into the show already and
I've got a lot of notes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably going to end up taking
us a couple of episodes here, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get through the veg
process today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next lesson will be planning
your flowering cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wrote a whole bunch of stuff and
honestly, it took me a little bit to get
[SPEAKER_02]: this together because I'm going to
apologize right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the last few episodes have
been a little wonky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously had a major concussion and I
can't focus to write long things like I
[SPEAKER_02]: used to, long lessons and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming back to me slowly,
but it takes me a little more effort and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more time to focus and write down
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please bear with me, but the lessons
are coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that things have not been the way
they should be with the show, but I have
[SPEAKER_02]: not been the way I should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't bring you the show you
needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting my shit back together,
which means the show is getting its shit
[SPEAKER_02]: back together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for being kind of slacking
off, but I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get a head injury, you don't know
what the hell's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting back to it and the show is
getting back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me prove that to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I have written.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have got a lot here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to try to read it off
the computer because the phone screen is
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's pull up the same thing here on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing on the computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it match?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this one's not updated.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to read it off the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an average growth should take about 100
to 120 days, maybe 150 days total in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil before harvesting, drying,
trimming, and curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to provide our plants with
optimal conditions, appropriate feedings,
[SPEAKER_02]: careful training, and selective pruning in
order to produce the finest medicine we
[SPEAKER_02]: can offer to our patients or clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that every day in each cycle is an
opportunity to show the plant some love
[SPEAKER_02]: and help your crop reach its full
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like each feeding, each application
of teas, bug sprays, foliar feeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: and any interaction with your plants is
your chance to make sure your crop reaches
[SPEAKER_02]: your client's expectations and the plant's
full potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: A great way to improve your crops is to
start a solid growth schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I want to talk about two different
schedules a grower should be on top of.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first schedule will be the basic
planning of a crop from seed to clone all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way up to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to discuss the phases of growth
from a small cloner seedling into
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative growth into the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to break down the flowering phase
into trimesters and talk about what the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are doing and what they want
through the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll also talk about what you could be
doing at each phase to improve your
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote here that if I can get you through
a 120-day grow lesson in this episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start my discussion on planning a
schedule that keeps your grow space
[SPEAKER_02]: producing as much herb as possible with as
little downtime as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, of course, will take multiple lights
and at least two small grow spaces,
[SPEAKER_02]: but setting up a small perpetual grow to
keep yourself supplied with headstache is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably easier than you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize now that I've written way too
much for one episode, so this is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely going to be broken down,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where we get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you begin your grow, I suggest
getting yourself a planner and making a
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be flexible because these are
plants, but try to stick with your plan if
[SPEAKER_02]: you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also suggest taking a lot of notes,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wonder what you did to that plant to
make it so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write down what you did so that you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where I'll describe the phases of
growth and timeframes of our plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that this grow is going to take
about 100 to 120 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go larger plants,
you can go up to 150.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people take a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the veg period is what's going to
make your difference there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start off with seedlings or clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to take about 14 days to be
in the seedling phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about 14 days when you start
germinating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the day you germinate it to the day
it's like a little plant, it's about 14
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to call that 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: A clone takes about 14 days to root and
get ready to be a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say seedling and clone phase
is about 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The veg growth depends on your goal,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to veg, if you're going in
small pots, you can veg for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to go into larger pots,
you can veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people veg for 30, 45 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also seen guys veg for 60 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the outdoor plants that people veg
for the early start of the year before the
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor season, I've seen people veg
plants for four, five, or six months to
[SPEAKER_02]: put them outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen is your plants are
going to get bigger and bigger and bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: the longer you veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go for a short veg in
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your flowering phase, I'm going to go for
a nine-week flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the plants I work with are about
nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine weeks is a good number because that
gives us three trimesters of three weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: each to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can talk about my theory of the
trimesters on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 14 days in seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: 63 days in flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at 77 days there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives us about 30 days to veg and fix
any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just basically start a short grow
from seed or clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow I'm going to talk about now is
basically the type of grow I would do if I
[SPEAKER_02]: were searching through a 10-pack of seeds
to find the keepers in the pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this, I would usually use a
three-gallon pot or a five-gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use, I don't know, probably
between nine and 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on how small I'm going to
keep the plants and how tight I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: cramp them in the space under the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just one light is all I'm talking
about right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we start from seeds or clones,
the only difference will be the first two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the clones root and the seedlings
take off, everything I'm talking about is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to work the same for seeds and
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with seeds, you'll have
to be sure that you eliminate the males
[SPEAKER_02]: before we get too far into flower,
but that's going to be your major
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're starting day one, we'll say start
day one right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we would cut our clones and start
germinating our seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do any lessons on
germinating seeds or cutting clones
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm pretty sure I've covered that
in past episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to refresh your course,
go back and listen to those, or if you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys want a brand new episode on that,
email me and I will go back and listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: the old episode and I'll try to do an
update for you, but only if enough people
[SPEAKER_02]: ask for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That episode's out there, so it should
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cut our clones and we started our seeds
for day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you want to mark the date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out your grow calendar and mark it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is day one for clones and seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend a 24-hour light cycle,
you guys, to start the first couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first few days are just a waiting
game, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're waiting for seeds, they'll pop
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll pop up from whatever medium you've
put them in, in like 48 hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully, or maybe it'll take them a
couple of days to start growing to the
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest putting your seedlings into,
I use beer cups, like solo cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your seedlings into the cups with a
light potting mix with plenty of drainage
[SPEAKER_02]: and holes in the bottoms of the cups,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once your seedlings have developed a nice
tap root of like about an inch to three
[SPEAKER_02]: inches long, that's when you want to throw
those in your dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clones will be lazy, but they'll root
around 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys are going to take a
little longer to get your clones to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about a healthy mother plant,
a good rooting environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it takes you more time to get your
clones rooted, just plan that into your
[SPEAKER_02]: next run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give yourself an extra week, an extra five
days, whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll start learning how to keep
healthier mother plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start learning how to clone better
and you'll speed up your cloning time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a lot of extra clones at first
because they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not good at cloning,
if you're new at this, take extras because
[SPEAKER_02]: you will lose them and don't be sad about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after several days, let's see,
where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: The seedlings are going to start growing
tall and skinny in the first few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: After several days, they'll develop their
first true leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: By this time, the clones are rooted and
ready for cups and the seedlings will be
[SPEAKER_02]: small plants and catching up to the
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't feed the seedlings until
about seven to 10 days in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do feed them, focus on root
inoculant and building a good root base
[SPEAKER_02]: for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a worm casting tea or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something like great white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use OGT.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that focuses on root inoculants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys, hopefully you've caught on
to what I'm talking about by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked a lot about root inoculant
with Sean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would feed the clones the same thing
when you put those into cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely like to feed my clones and my
seedlings a lot of root inoculants to get
[SPEAKER_02]: that soil funky and get the roots fat,
fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The better roots, the better the fruits is
what I say all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by now, I feel like we should be
putting our clones into cups and starting
[SPEAKER_02]: week three if everything went correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fed the plants once.
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me feel like everything is one
lesson now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we've gotten to week three and
the clones and the seedlings are caught
[SPEAKER_02]: up, I feel like there won't be much
difference between the clone and the
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seedlings may grow more quickly
because they have what we call seed vigor,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's not always the case if you have
good clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some clones outgrow seedlings
before and it's been kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we've done up to this point is
pretty much plant our seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gotten our starter plants into cups
and we've fed them some worm tea or some
[SPEAKER_02]: root inoculant, maybe some great white,
maybe some OGT, something like that to get
[SPEAKER_02]: them started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm going to call this the
beginning of veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people may call it pre-veg because we
haven't gone into our big pots yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm going to call it veg starting now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we've gotten out of the cloner,
now that we're not little baby seedlings
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, I'm going to say we're into veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the veg state can last as long as you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer you veg, like I said earlier,
the larger your plants are going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: The veg phase is where we do 90% of the
topping, training and pruning of your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of did a lesson on topping and
stuff like that, but I plan to do another
[SPEAKER_02]: episode all about improving your crops and
improving your yields and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll come in handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, your plants are going to take up 90%
of the nitrogen that they use through
[SPEAKER_02]: their entire lives during the vegetative
phase of their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: People tend to really overlook the veg
phase and they focus only on the bloom
[SPEAKER_02]: phase because that's when you can see your
buds, but the veg phase is just as
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is your veg space, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't spend the time
building a proper veg room and it really
[SPEAKER_02]: would help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you teach those kids how to run before
you put them on the track, they'd be a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: better performing kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like if we use each day as a
chance to prepare the plants for bloom,
[SPEAKER_02]: our crop will look much better at harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My veg phase for my example of this grow
is going to be short, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, give me one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause and take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably take a dab while I'm there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me for one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we are at the beginning of veg
is where I left off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to feed my plants the first day
of each week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mondays are usually my feeding day for my
personal crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, starting everything on a Monday
helps me keep track of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the first day of veg, I would feed
my plants a nice base nutrient,
[SPEAKER_02]: a light humic acid, some potassium
silicates to build strong cell walls,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would also keep focusing on root
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't need any Kalamag or anything
like that for the first couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything should be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the first couple of weeks,
your plants should be cool in the cups,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're going to have to plant them into
larger pots pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to see them get root bound
in those cups and they'll also get tall
[SPEAKER_02]: and skinny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to bush out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we put them into a larger pot,
they'll start bushing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also a good time to adjust your
lights from 24 hours to an 18-6 schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want them on for 18 hours,
off for six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants like a rest period, and it's also
going to save you money on your energy
[SPEAKER_02]: bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've got your plants into cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're starting to kind of grow a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got nice roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about three weeks in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by the fourth week is when we
should start putting everything into
[SPEAKER_02]: larger pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we leave them in the cups too long,
they're going to get root bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to start getting stretchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, when you put them into bigger
pots, they can go a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_02]: without needing water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll help you out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to veg for a couple
extra weeks and you have time for time and
[SPEAKER_02]: space, go for bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: For my example, we're just going to do a
quick crop and we're going to use
[SPEAKER_02]: three-gallon pots and they'll be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So carefully put everything from your cups
into a three-gallon pot or a larger pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: whichever you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've talked about
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've talked a little bit about
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys need help transplanting,
let me know and I'll talk more about that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm pretty sure I've covered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So carefully put everything into a larger
pot and feed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be about week four, maybe into
week five by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys, I hope you started doing
these into pots around week four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you didn't wait too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feed them and you're going to feed them
a strong dose of root inoculant,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to do that through veg
right up to kind of the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed them a veg-based nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm using bottled nutrients for this,
I would recommend Botanicare Pure Blend
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro Soil Formula, the grow formula.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use some humic acid in there for
this grow for my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using bottles, I would say
Liquid Karma from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use a fulvic acid, which
Organicare sells a liquid fulvic acid that
[SPEAKER_02]: works great for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use some Cal Mag at this point,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start needing some Cal Mag
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very light dose of Cal Mag to start
because your babies aren't ready for it
[SPEAKER_02]: just yet, possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want you to burn them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful with that Cal Mag,
but it's about to be time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also recommend something to feed
the microbes, basic molasses or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like Humboldt honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hybre would be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that with a lot of
molasses-y type stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now our plants are in their final pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants can be topped or super
cropped or manipulated into a screen of
[SPEAKER_02]: green or whatever you have planned for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure that if you're going to do
any topping or pruning, do that about 10
[SPEAKER_02]: to 14 days before you start flowering the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants need a little bit of time to
recover after you've topped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are apical dominant, which means
they want a top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you've cut the tops, the hormones
have to move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to move hormones around and you
want those hormones built up in the tips
[SPEAKER_02]: of your plants before you flower them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really helpful for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start topping stuff and pruning
things and then flower right away,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just going to make little tiny buds
and confuse the shit out of your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we are in our bigger pots and
we've fed everything, I'm going to say we
[SPEAKER_02]: are in full veg mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our plants in the finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things have been topped and super cropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our lights on a veg schedule of
18 on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be feeding a solid veg recipe at
the start of every week and watching for
[SPEAKER_02]: any signs of bug problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a good idea to start a bug
prevention regimen by now if you haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: already started spraying or doing
something to keep the mites away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem oil is a great way to prevent bugs
while you're in veg, but do not ever spray
[SPEAKER_02]: a flowering plant with neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: One application of neem oil on a flowering
plant will ruin the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor will be miserable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you make extracts, they will taste like
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't spray anything on your
flowering plants, any bug sprays or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything on your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to spray stuff on
flowering plants, make sure it's a well,
[SPEAKER_02]: well thought out foliar feed, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think I can write a whole
separate rant on pest management in
[SPEAKER_02]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said that we should feed on Monday of
every week, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to feed on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mix up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mix up a nice reservoir of nutrients and
feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Monday, they get a nice healthy
feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then usually by Wednesday or Thursday,
they need more, they need a water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just feed them clean pH balanced
water with no nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just feed them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on Monday again, I will give them
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next time that they're
thirsty, probably that next Wednesday or
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday, they will get a fully organic
worm tea that I have brewed for like 36
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put worm castings in there and put
grow Kashi in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a little bit of Dragonfly Earth
medicine, the lush roots in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: put a little bit of fish hydrously and I
put some sea crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll feed my plants that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get fed teas probably twice in
veg and probably three times during the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it makes a huge difference
because I make a pretty awesome tea that
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean taught me how to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of my feeding idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've ever broken down my
week to week feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be responsible for your
weekly feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to let you experiment and
find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got questions about specific
nutrients, let me know and I'll do my best
[SPEAKER_02]: to figure out how to incorporate that into
your grow for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I was saying earlier, we can veg
as long as we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: For my example, we're going to veg for
about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can top and manipulate the plants as
much as you want while in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I already read this?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I would stop topping about two
weeks before flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: My shorter crops don't really get much
topping and pruning, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm running a seed crop and I want to
seed what the seedlings are, I really
[SPEAKER_02]: don't top much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take two clones from each plant just
before I flower it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I clean up the bottoms just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once I flower, I clean up the
bottoms once I flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my small crops really don't get much
topping or pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to get the test crops just in and
out quickly so I can see what I'm working
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I've got a bunch of boys in
there or if I don't see the traits I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for, then I just want to get that
out of there and scrap it as soon as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for specific traits at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next 30 days, while we're in veg,
basically we need to watch for bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: watch for problems, and keep the plants as
healthy and happy as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I suggest checking each plant every
single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
but however many plants you've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should touch every plant every single
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know you're growing from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know you've got solid
medicine that doesn't need to be sprayed
[SPEAKER_02]: with Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know that if you do see a
problem, you'll be on top of it and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to solve the problem before
it gets out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super important, being a good
gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I suggest checking each day and make
notes of what you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see anything that stands out to
you, make a note of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's good, if it's bad, if it's weird,
if you're not sure, if it's new,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's questionable, make a note and
don't forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know you're going to say,
oh, membership, the notes are in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we're potheads, we're pot growers,
we're dabbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to forget something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when maybe one day you're going to
want to run a business, and the guy with
[SPEAKER_02]: the notes will get the opportunity to run
a business over the guy with the head full
[SPEAKER_02]: of bullshit and ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've written something down that shows
you've done something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other guy's like, I remember doing
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that are hiring you to be their
master grower at their dispensary don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want your hopes and dreams in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to see it on paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take notes, you got something
that's documented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that it's legal, you don't have to
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you old school growers didn't
want any notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So set a date for your flowering cycle is
what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decide how long you want to veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set a date for your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then commit to that and veg for that
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your plants trimmed up, get them
pruned, get them topped.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put them in a screen of
green, like Spence taught us about,
[SPEAKER_02]: put them in the screen of green and get
them nice and happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll get them ready for the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone for 30 minutes and I don't think
I can get enough of the flowering cycle to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it worth your listen in to this
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're just going to start
wrapping up the show at 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys really listen a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put out shorter episodes,
you don't seem to get the attention
[SPEAKER_02]: deficit disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to do a short episode
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will come back in a week and I will have
a solid lesson about the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to get Spence on an upcoming
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Sean and he'll be back in
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an episode coming up about how to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of things planned,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really getting back on my game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting more lessons written down,
getting more episodes planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you sticking through my rough
patch there while I had to do some
[SPEAKER_02]: slopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to everybody who sent me well
wishes on taking care of my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: wishing me better on my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to say I'm about, I kept saying I
was 90%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about 85% back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep noticing sometimes I'll say the
wrong word in a sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day I told somebody that I was
going to eat this banana and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually holding a burrito.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even realize that I kept
saying banana, but it was a burrito.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they corrected me and I said,
yeah, this banana is tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, it's a fucking burrito.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realized I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was describing something that was purple
and I called it orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I did that, but I don't,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's stuff like that that's going on
in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still a little bit goofy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I forget my password still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to log into my computer,
but I'm getting it back together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do appreciate you guys sticking with
me through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a really scary time,
but I feel like I'm coming back together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's wrap up the show guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking rambly today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that part?
[SPEAKER_02]: That I read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, thanks for listening to another
episode.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 69 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_02]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back with another solo episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's hanging out with me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me all by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get too far, I do need to send
you guys a huge apology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there was an issue with the
last episode I posted to Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it has since been corrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to drop down that music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to repeat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last episode I posted to Stitcher went
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went to Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went to the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything went perfectly, but for some
reason when Stitcher grabbed it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it only took the first 14 or 15 minutes of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first couple of days of the week,
you guys were only able to access a
[SPEAKER_02]: 15-minute episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right when the grow lesson came in,
everything cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher got it fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took him a couple of days, but Stitcher
did repair that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big shout out to Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to everybody who went back and
listened to that episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys tried to listen and gave up
because it sucked, go back and the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: episode is there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 30-something minute episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cover most of veg growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that that's out of the way,
let's move forward with the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I received a question that I want to
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me, why do you turn off the
lights during your foliar feeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm using a bug spray or a foliar
feed, I turn off the lights because when
[SPEAKER_02]: you spray the plants with a liquid,
it makes little bubbles on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you've got these high intensity
discharge lights right above them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works the same way as if you took a
magnifying glass and shone the sun through
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it a reflector bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: The magnifying glass and the sun work,
and it makes that little dot on shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it burns it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can catch paper on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a kid, I remember we used to
burn ants and shit with the magnifying
[SPEAKER_02]: glass using the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubble on your plants will do the
exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll create that magnifier bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light will hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll intensify the light beam into one
spot on your plant, and it will actually
[SPEAKER_02]: create a little burn mark on your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a foliar feed or a bug
spray, I fully recommend you turn off the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ideal to do it right before the
lights go out if you can, but sometimes we
[SPEAKER_02]: have jobs and shit that prevent us from
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is why I turn off the lights when
I foliar feed, and that's why I recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: you turn off the lights when you foliar
feed or bug spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on in my world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I was at the spot yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a couple hours out at the spot
dispensary in Pueblo West, and things are
[SPEAKER_02]: really moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be out there growing cannabis
very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly, we're waiting for inspections from
the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a couple small more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need... Not important stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a few small steps to get through
before I'm able to put plants in the spot
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary and start growing recreational
cannabis that you will be able to come
[SPEAKER_02]: try.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you guys know when the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are ready.
I'll let you guys know when the plants are
ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been all here and I know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you guys that have not
abandoned me and my show through that
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, extra huge shout out to all the
people who have sent me love and support
[SPEAKER_02]: and well wishes telling me to get better,
telling me to take care of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several people volunteered to come do
chores for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have no idea what that means to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting back on my feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been on my feet, but I'm
getting my head back in there while I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move on to the grow lesson,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've written a bunch of stuff and I'm
going to try to condense it all into one
[SPEAKER_02]: lesson for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I may leave a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, just ask and
I'll go back over anything I went too fast
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a quick drink and a dab
and we are going to get on with the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, while I'm taking a dab,
make sure you support our sponsors,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need organic soil amendments or
high quality worm castings, check out www
[SPEAKER_02]: .rockymountainwormco.com today.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys, in the last episode,
I talked a lot about vegetative growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: we got right up to the first day of
flowering and that's where I want to start
[SPEAKER_02]: off today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, let's talk a little bit about
the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've alluded that there are three
trimesters to the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me explain a little what I meant
by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this, we're going to talk about a
nine-week flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use Grateful Dog as an example
because it likes to finish in about nine
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, so that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first trimester is what I would refer
to as the transition phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second trimester is full flower and
the third trimester is the finishing and
[SPEAKER_02]: ripening phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try to talk a little bit
about what the plants want during each
[SPEAKER_02]: trimester and I'll do my best to kind of
break it down week by week for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let you know what to feed and what you
can be doing to your plants each week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find like the main important things
to do to your plants each week and then
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you some ideas that will really
improve your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in a future episode, we're going
to focus all about improving your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today would be day one of week one of
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would start on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go to that Monday and I would say
day one of flower, week one, day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would go through and mark that
calendar, week two, week three,
[SPEAKER_02]: week four, week five, week six,
so that it's easily viewable.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to set the lights for a 12-12
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we want the lights to be on for
12 hours and off for 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: uninterrupted darkness every day and every
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have any dark during the night
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stress or any light during the
night cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stress how important it is to have
total darkness for the dark period of your
[SPEAKER_02]: bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The room needs to be totally pitch black
dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can see any light in there,
it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can stand in the room and put your
hand in front of your face, if you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: your hand at all, you need more darkness
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's completely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's equally important not to interrupt
the dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interrupting the dark period will cause
your plants to possibly herm and possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants are asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to let them sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It pisses you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I wake you up in the middle of the
night, it pisses your plants off too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're running a 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to keep my metal halide bulbs in
for the first two weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first week of flowering,
I would feed my vegetative base nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would start pumping up my P and K
values.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also keep focusing on root
development a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were using bottled nutrients,
I would use a little bit of liquid karma,
[SPEAKER_02]: some silica blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use a little bit of Humboldt honey
and some roots ZHO or something similar,
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind of similar rooting powder or
maybe some, what was I using before,
[SPEAKER_02]: OGT that works, some great white shark
works, anything like that would work for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also maybe I would add in some
hygrosine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect to see a whole lot of action
from the plants your first week of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the start of the transitional
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, this is transitional phase
from veg to bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in about six to 10 days is where
you're really going to see your changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me add something here while I'm
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants are going to get fed nutrients
on every Monday, but they're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get thirsty and need a drink
before the next Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably going to be Wednesday or
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on that day, water your plants with
just clean water, pHed at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to feed every day because
then your plants are going to start to get
[SPEAKER_02]: over fertilized and they are going to get
what we call nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of your bottled nutrients are salt
based.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we keep feeding these salts to our
plants, they get salty and they don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to take up more salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they simply stop taking up nutrients
and that's called nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to feed clean water every
Wednesday or Thursday and prevent that
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient lockout by giving these girls a
fresh drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to put us into week two.
[SPEAKER_02]: For week two, I would start feeding my
bloom based nutrients and I would add some
[SPEAKER_02]: cow mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would add, this is if you're going to
use bottled nutrients, and this is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: would use if I were using Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a different brand,
all of these products are easily
[SPEAKER_02]: replaceable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look at your feed chart and look at
your other brand and replace the bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for week two, I would do some cow mag,
some Liquid Karma, Silica Blast,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would add a little bit of C Plex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week two is where you really need to start
paying attention for male plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you started from seeds, you're going to
start seeing little ball sacks develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got males in there, get them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: In week two, you should start seeing
preflowers and the plants are starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of this week, you should have
identified your males and isolated them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't plan on breeding,
definitely get those males out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put them in the garage,
they may keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put them somewhere, they may keep
going and make pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you plan on breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you plan on breeding, then I don't
need to tell you what to do with males.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already got that figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for week two, they're pretty much just
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start seeing flower sets
start to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start to see the sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using feminized seeds,
still pay attention to the sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may get some hermaphrodites,
some shit could have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have gotten the wrong seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take that feminized label as the
complete, this will be a perfect female
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could not be the case.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So week three, week three is a busy week.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we really started getting
busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have identified your males by
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have pulled them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, if you had clones of those,
you tossed the clones of the males also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't have nice bud sites
developed, by the beginning of week three,
[SPEAKER_02]: you may have a light leak or another issue
during your dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not starting to see little
dandelion-looking bud sites by now,
[SPEAKER_02]: go in the room at night and make sure
you're not getting a light leak.
[SPEAKER_02]: A small light leak will prevent your
plants from going into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for week three, I would feed my
bloom-based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would feed Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would introduce Fulvex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use Hydroplex, C-Plex,
Silicoblast, Humboldt, Honey, and
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygrozyme this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be the basic recipe through
flowering minus the Hygrozyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only Hygrozyme every other feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do add a few other things to my personal
mix, but this will get you guys through
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get too crazy and have you
buying a whole bunch of things when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did get this mix from the Botanicare
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need help mixing up a great
Botanicare recipe, just go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanicare website, go to the nutrient
calculator, basically fill in it and ask
[SPEAKER_02]: how many weeks you want to veg,
how many weeks you want to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It asks you which bottles of nutrients
you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: You click on those and it'll tell you what
to feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend reducing it just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed your plants a reduced mix and see how
they react.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always feed more, but you can't
un-feed your plants once they've burned
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the company, but they are a
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need you to buy more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of tell you to use a little
bit extra, is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you use, the sooner you got to
buy another bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's talk more about week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go get that on the Botanicare
website is where I left off, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a different brand,
they do have a different feeding chart
[SPEAKER_02]: online for you to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all the popular brands have a
feeding chart right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can easily, like I said,
you can easily swap out bottle for bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just read, like I said,
liquid karma, read the bottle,
[SPEAKER_02]: see what's in there, look at whatever
brand you're using and there's the
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent for your brand is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all basically the same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just prefer Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going bottled newts.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also like to add a nice dose of carbs
and sugars at week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start seeing resin
production around week, midweek three,
[SPEAKER_02]: early week four.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll very little resin production,
but it will start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why not give it some carbs and sugars
to start contributing to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think that carbs and sugars
keep the mycos in your root zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: living and healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is always a good idea to add those
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in week three, we should really see bud
sites developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good time to start lulling
popping your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means is kind of cleaning up the
bottom little mini buds and the sucker
[SPEAKER_02]: branches that aren't going to get enough
light to become viable buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get in there and clean that shit
right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a whole lesson on lolly popping
if we haven't already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light's only going to penetrate your
canopy about 18 to 20, maybe 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using regular thousand watt
bulbs, if you're using lower wattage,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got even less penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to want to get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your plant's three foot tall,
you don't need a whole three foot stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to kind of clean off the bottom
12 inches or so, and that gives you more
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those buds that develop down there are
just going to be wispy shit anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you're going to make hash with it,
clean that up, send all that energy up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the plant because you don't
want to waste time trimming that bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to lolly pop, clean up the
bottoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I would recommend switching from
metal halide bulbs to high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: bulbs at the start of week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week three is the last week of the first
trimester and it's the last week of the
[SPEAKER_02]: transition and stretching phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after this week, your plants will quit
stretching so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week three is really the super stretch and
then week four, they'll quit stretching
[SPEAKER_02]: and start working more on buds for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in week three, you want to lolly pop
and you want to change to your high
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure sodium bulbs are your main goals
for week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I know I'm going kind of fast,
but we got nine weeks to cover here and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only to week four and we're 15 minutes
in already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So week four, I'm going to feed a very
similar mix that I would in week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week four is the end of the stretch phase
and the start of actual bud growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll really start to see buds developing
by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get in there and make sure
you've got darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you don't have some shitty
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So week four is another week to lolly pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely get in there and lolly
pop a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use my thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't trim my thumbnail all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use that to pick off those little
sucker buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collect them up, put them in a little
trash can and toss them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them in the compost pile if you're
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little sucker buds are just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just little suckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that energy could go up to the top of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are growing for just hash,
you could do whatever you want with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's also a good time to start
adding stakes or some sort of supports to
[SPEAKER_02]: the branches because we're going to get
some hefty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we get into week five and six,
we're really going to need stakes to
[SPEAKER_02]: support everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by week five and six, it's such a
bitch to maneuver those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your branches got long sticky colas on
there and you don't want to be playing
[SPEAKER_02]: with the resin and getting the resin all
over your clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to leave that on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get in there about week four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to put a stake to support the
middle cola because I know I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a big, huge fat cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to put about four,
maybe six sticks around the pot because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get some big colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use those sticks to strap up my
major colas just right to the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do it early because like I'm saying,
in week five and six, I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some buds going on that I don't want to
have to mess with so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I got them all strapped up already,
I don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm working with soil plants,
I usually don't use a trellis or a screen
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the dispensary where I'm running
the Big Grow, we are definitely using a
[SPEAKER_02]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to trellis the plants,
you need to get that in there during your
[SPEAKER_02]: veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why when I was doing the veg
lesson, I mentioned that this is the week
[SPEAKER_02]: to do any type of trellising and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll have to happen in veg,
you guys, because those plants are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow up into that trellis and you don't
want to be bending them and folding them
[SPEAKER_02]: and manipulating them in flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're making a schedule now
before we put these plants in the dirt or
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rock wall cubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get your stakes up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your stakes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: More lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're doing for week four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's transition into week five now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when the fun starts, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants start getting photogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds start getting chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're getting chunky buds,
it's a good time to stop foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't talk a lot about foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Foliar feeding can lead to a lot of
problems if it's done incorrectly or at
[SPEAKER_02]: the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't introduced that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have gone on your own and
started foliar feeding, week five is when
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend you quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also important to pay attention to
your humidity in week five.
[SPEAKER_02]: High humidity and big buds can be a great
way to create powdery mildew or other
[SPEAKER_02]: mold-related problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys that listen to the
podcast have heard me talk about growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in a new room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a exterior wall corner that got
really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that corner pocket right there had a
lot of cold air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a five ounce white rhino plant
that I cut down and discovered powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew on one bud of it as I was cutting
it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I threw the entire plant away.
[SPEAKER_02]: About probably five ounces worth of good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere between four and six ounces is
what those plants were averaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those five ounces that my patients did
not get to enjoy because I let it get
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pay attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let your room get too humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: My problem was that it was cold and I was
letting cold air mix with the warm air and
[SPEAKER_02]: that created mildew in my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I learned from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit will never happen to me again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, if it happens to you,
don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to learn from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how you deal with it is what makes
you the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do your best to get the humidity under
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want too much humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not want to start getting mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: For week five, I would recommend getting
your humidity right around 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it to 40, there's nothing
wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you're going to get problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too low of humidity, your room's going to
dry up kind of quickly and the buds don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get as sticky, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have the option or if you're
stuck with one, if you have to go too high
[SPEAKER_02]: or too low, definitely go too low of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about getting rid of the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading notes as I do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is where I would stop
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, week five, don't lollipop
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can if you want to, but you should
have gotten all that taken care of by now
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're just going to shock the plant
if you keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep lollipopping and fucking with
the plant this far in, you may cause it to
[SPEAKER_02]: stress out and herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on what other stress
you're giving to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should have a room full of sexy,
chunky buds by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to start falling over and
needing attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you've got plenty of sticks
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in there paying attention every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to go in there one day and
you're going to find a bud that you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: notice and it's going to be straight
sideways looking like it's ready to break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't panic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get in there and support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it some support.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit's going to happen to you and
you're going to learn all these things
[SPEAKER_02]: over a couple of grows of what to look for
and you'll learn to stop panicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see a problem, guys, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I keep saying that, but if you
freak out, you're just going to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see a problem in the grow room,
just take a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we'll just make BHO out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for week five, I like to add a really
strong dose of sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite bottled products is
Humboldt Honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that at week three, but I use a nice
fat dose of it again at week five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for week five, you want to make sure
you've got your supports in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't done it in week four,
you may need to add a few more sticks in
[SPEAKER_02]: place for week five to get those bigger
buds up in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do, I put a, I think it's a six
foot tall bamboo sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow big plants, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a six foot tall bamboo stick toward
the outer edge of the plant because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to disrupt too much of the
root.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just shove it right into there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I grab the bud that needs some
support and I use, I've used several
[SPEAKER_02]: different things, but right now I'm using,
they call them fuzzy sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a whole bunch for really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought a shit ton of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a, it's a pipe cleaner,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a really long bread tie that you
can handle better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just take that and I wrap that right
around the stock of the bud that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to fall over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, maybe I'll do part of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on how heavy the bud is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I feel like it'll break the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I take that and just wrap it
around the bud or the stock and wrap that
[SPEAKER_02]: around the stick itself so that it's just
strapped right up to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got a broken finger, just give
that sucker some support.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't want it falling over and
breaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your whole goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you tip it a little bit,
if it's at an angle, it's a good idea
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you can expose more of that
bud to the light instead of just having it
[SPEAKER_02]: completely up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tip it, you get a little more
surface area for that light to hit,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will increase your harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So week five, you want to work on your
supports.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to feed some sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to monitor your humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it around 50 to 40% and keep it there
because you're going to start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: chunkier buds and you don't need mildew
and you're going to stop foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's going to happen in week
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to move us into week six.
[SPEAKER_02]: In week six, I would feed a very similar
recipe as I did in week five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd use high amounts of P and K and lots
of sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would reduce my base nutrients and focus
on resin production and healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week six will be our last full feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buds should be chunky and the resin
should be starting to cover the buds and
[SPEAKER_02]: the small leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing a strain that purples
up, now is a good time to lower the temps
[SPEAKER_02]: a few degrees during the night cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep my grow rooms about 74 to 77
degrees during the light period.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the dark period, I try to get it
down to about 68, 69 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point in week six, if I'm working
with something that will purple up a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit like the Kalanji Kush or the
Flow or the Ghost OG or the Grateful Dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would drop the temps down just a few
more to like 65 degrees, maybe 67.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get to that 65 at night,
you'll see it in a night or two,
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants will start to purple up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves will turn purple for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Higher CBD plants, I think like more cold,
but that's just my experience with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Tora Bora and the Night Nurse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have a totally different plant,
so don't take that as a rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might want to lower the temps just
a little bit if you're trying to pull out
[SPEAKER_02]: the purples.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more Sativa dominant plants,
this would probably piss off the Capelton.
[SPEAKER_02]: The White Widow would not like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Jeffrey would not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put those in the cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Kushy plants, Indica dominant plants,
give them a little bit of cold and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: purple up for you about week six.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to use more air
conditioning, so that may cost you a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, but I think it's worth it for
the plant that enjoys that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week seven's a great week for photography,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is however your last feeding,
so whatever your plants are lacking or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you haven't gotten in there,
this is probably your last chance to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to feed on week seven,
but we're not going to feed the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to give a little bit of
stuff to keep it alive and happy and
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week six, basically work on a good
feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lower your temps if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you've got everything supported
and staked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure nothing falls over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going through every single week,
you guys, and check for herms,
[SPEAKER_02]: check for males, check for issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say this also, every day,
if you can do it every day, go in your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden and grab each plant and just grab
one leaf and flip it upside down and
[SPEAKER_02]: inspect the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see any signs of bugs, any kinds of
pests, that's when we need to get in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and really deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you're not too far into flower
by the time we discover a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in flower when we discover
pests, that's a whole other conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you have to decide,
are these pests going to ruin my garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before harvest time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can I eradicate these pests somehow?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of decisions to make in
that scramble mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a whole pest management episode
in the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week six, we have lower the temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our last big feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you took a lot of pictures in
week six because week six is photogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week seven, this is when we start what
I've been calling the third trimester.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is ripening and the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't feed most of our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, I would only use the humble
honey for the yucca extract and the
[SPEAKER_02]: sweetener in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really going to make your plant
sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make them dense up and it's
going to make them taste good and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make them stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also use sea plex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think sea plex really contributes to the
aroma and flavor of a cush dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of sea plex in your cushy plants
will bring out that funk, that feedy
[SPEAKER_02]: smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A grateful dog loves sea plex.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing grateful dog,
when you crack it open, there is an
[SPEAKER_02]: offensive odor that comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost foot-like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost armpit-like and it has a scent
of fuel to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you pump up the sea plex or a
sea kelp based product when you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: grateful dog, it will definitely increase
that funky ass terpene you're getting out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using humble honey, sea plex,
hygrozyme also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like enzymes at this phase to start
breaking down dead material, dead roots
[SPEAKER_02]: that have maybe died and need to be
composed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hygrozyme will help eliminate that
shit and speed things along for the flush
[SPEAKER_02]: phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, add some fulvex if you want to speed
things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Sean taught us that you can use
OGT to speed up the flushing phase of your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants because the rock phosphates make
the plant cycle too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It speeds up the nutritive cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will assist us in the flush phase if
we'd like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not use any of that shit like final
phase or clear X or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that stuff leaves a little bit
of a flavor in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believe that if we are growing
properly and we're flushing properly,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't need that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just another product to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a science behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, we are filling the
plant with salts and those flushing agents
[SPEAKER_02]: are basically sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Complex sugars break down salts,
which would break the bond of the salts
[SPEAKER_02]: around the root base, which would allow
cleaner absorption of the roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything would just taste better and
flow better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they're necessary
unless you fuck up at some point in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very close to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to start getting the excess
nutrients out of our buds before we cut
[SPEAKER_02]: them down and prepare them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to start getting the nitrogen,
the phosphorus, the potassium,
[SPEAKER_02]: the manganese, the calcium, the magnesium,
all the shit that we've been shoving into
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get it out of there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That moves us into week eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week eight is the official beginning of
the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like to do, and this kind of
depends on your setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have smaller pots, you can move the
pots to the bathroom or the shower,
[SPEAKER_02]: throw a cinder block, put something down
so you don't scratch up the bathtub or the
[SPEAKER_02]: shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys put a towel down, throw a cinder
block or a bucket right in the bathtub or
[SPEAKER_02]: the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're using a three gallon
pot, I like to run about nine or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of water right through that pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds excessive, but what
you're doing, you're washing the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get all of the nutrients that
we've poured into this plant through the
[SPEAKER_02]: past seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to rinse all that shit out of the
dirt now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant has been eating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to kind of starve the plant for
the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using bigger pots, it might not
be feasible or rational to drag them to
[SPEAKER_02]: another room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a seven gallon pot, I usually pour
about a gallon and a half of water through
[SPEAKER_02]: it and just let it fill up in that little
tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I use a shop vac, a wet dry vac
to go suck the water out of the trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds excessive, but I really
like to clean out the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this method doesn't work for you,
well, you have to really focus on when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want water to come out of the bottom
of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to say at least 10% of the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see that come back out of the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I know I'm actually flushing
that plant and pushing something out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing's coming out of the bottom,
nothing's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get water to flow to get all
those nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to want to do that
without drowning your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to flush it,
let it dry, and then flush it again as
[SPEAKER_02]: many times as we can until the end of week
nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the week eight is the start of
flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably going to water the shit
out of it on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be ready for water again
until probably Thursday or Friday because
[SPEAKER_02]: you watered it so heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be in too much of a rush to water it
again because you will drown the damn
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Thursday or Friday when you water it
again, do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of water, just lots of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let it go right on through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let it drain right on through.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a floor drain or something,
just keep pouring water through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't over flush in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ideal to use three times the volume
of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a nine gallon pot or a
three gallon pot, you want to use nine
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a five gallon pot,
you want to put 15 gallons of water
[SPEAKER_02]: through that bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what I said?
[SPEAKER_02]: Five gallon pot, 15 gallons of water,
it's three times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making sure I'm doing good math here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head injuries coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flush really good, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bitch a lot about cannabis because it's
improperly flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're smoking a joint, if the joint
won't stay lit, if you have to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: relighting it, there's a good chance it
wasn't flushed properly or I rolled it and
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't roll with this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if your ashes are black and chunky,
there are still nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a nice clean white ash that's
nice and smooth and soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want chunks of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ash into your hand, it should feel
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should almost enjoy that nice smooth
texture of the ashes if your plants were
[SPEAKER_02]: flushed properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my biggest complaints about
dispensary cannabis, and I am trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: fix this in my shop, they don't flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not flush and they do not cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pretty much say, shit's done,
cut it down and sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to try to change that where
I'm working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing is important, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stress that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from week eight, you want to flush,
run plenty of clean water through that
[SPEAKER_02]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week nine, flushing is in full effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week nine ends at day 63.
[SPEAKER_02]: On day 60, here's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in the grow room and start taking off
all of the big fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any leaf that has a petiole, that's a
stem, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any leaf that has a stem that you can get
to, take some scissors and cut that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: off really close to the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go in there and de-leaf the entire
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need these leaves anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to save you time when it
comes to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So day 60, you walked in there and you
took off all of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I do in my grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got three days left, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: On day 61, I reduce my lights from 12,
12 to 10, 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on for 10 hours and I'm off for 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are going, oh shit,
he's going to kill us now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time is near.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, I'll drop them down to eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on day three, I'll give them 24 hours
of total darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So day 63, no light at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave them off for the entire day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Day 64, wake up bright and early,
nice and ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in and cut down the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just let them hang.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's harvest day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 63 or 64 days, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine weeks of full flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got through that in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have to kind of skip a couple of
details.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to talk right through this,
but I got a throat thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take a drink here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you guys through nine weeks and 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left some stuff out, but I feel like
that leaves me more shit to teach you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: and more tips to give you in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll survive a crop with everything I
taught you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that I should mention,
if you do grow a longer strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend reducing the light to 11
hours on and 13 hours off around week
[SPEAKER_02]: nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only if you're growing something
that takes 11 weeks or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sativas won't finish up without a
shortened day period.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is they are from an area that
only have a few hours difference in the
[SPEAKER_02]: natural day and night cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to encourage them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just burped right into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to encourage these plants to
finish up by shortening the days.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when we shorten the days is
the plant realizes that winter is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: and our plant's main goal is to pollinate
and create seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it hasn't received any pollen,
it's kind of being stubborn about
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I really think it's like a dude
at a party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It thinks if it hangs out late enough,
there's still a chance of getting laid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we got to do is we got to start
messing with the lights and tell these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys, your time's up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to turn, tell the girls actually,
we're going to turn the lights down and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll start finishing on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, some of these sativas will just
keep on going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Durban poison strain that went for
14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was getting tired of that bitch
because I needed the room and I was done
[SPEAKER_02]: growing that strain and that crop and it
wouldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought, well, why don't I just
reduce the lights down a little bit and
[SPEAKER_02]: speed this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, within one week of reducing
the lights, it finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to tell it so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also you may want to feed for a little
bit longer if you're running a longer
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, I would extend the week six
regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to extend anything,
just repeat week six until you get to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, if you have three extra weeks,
just do week six, three extra times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm trying to say here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, my voice is burning out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a little bit more stuff here,
but I'm running out of throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're going to do another 35
minute show and wrap this bitch up,
[SPEAKER_02]: put a bow on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you guys for listening to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more information, please email
me.

follow me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a message on one of those
platforms and say, Hey bro, when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing your grow lesson, I needed to know
this and you didn't tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will make a lesson out of that just
for you in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I apologize that my throat is
burning out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just wrap it up so I don't have to
sound like shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can tell that my head's
getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered a product from onit.com called
AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to Joe Rogan or any of those
other podcasts, you've heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: AlphaBrain is used by public speakers and
lecturers and folks in that type of a
[SPEAKER_02]: position that have to speak, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But they say that AlphaBrain, it's a
nootropic and it is supposed to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: your ability to recall names and facts and
locations, and it's supposed to broaden
[SPEAKER_02]: your vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that'll improve my head injury
and fix all my problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't have a voice left.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I want to send a big huge thank

[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Kat Kuth and the entire Mystic

[SPEAKER_02]: The song you're listening to right now is
called the Doggy Dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you support my friends in the
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a great show put together for
you, Kat, for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn that music down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really distracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cut that right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a few things I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody that's helped me out this past
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was driving up to Colorado Springs to go
see our good friends Hunt and Damsel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, the Jordans and,
of course, John Randall Jr. was headed up
[SPEAKER_02]: there to Spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to go pay them a visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fucking transmission went out on
my car about a mile from Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see the first exit in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see the Dam Circle Drive,
Lake Avenue sign right in front of me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just couldn't get off the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: My car pretty much exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like I was doing a good 75 miles
an hour on the interstate in the rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like my car downshifted from 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately was going about 45 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like sort of like, and then it
was like, is what it felt like to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like my engine was trying to jump
out of the car and into my lap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, I hit the brakes,
signaled, got over as quickly as I could,
[SPEAKER_02]: got to the side of the road, turn on the
hazards called AAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took AAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They quoted me 85 minutes to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got there in 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking 85 minute is a long 85 minute
wait is a long wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sixty five minutes was less than what they
promised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that that's a good job on AAA's
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made friends with the AAA tow truck
driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had your business card with me
right now in my pocket, but I've set it
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually in the car that's broken
down that is at the mechanic shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I get your card out of there,
I'll give you a shout out on the show
[SPEAKER_02]: because the truck driver was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to tow me about 50 miles home,
get me back to the house, but I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a car for a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to cost a little bit to get
that son of a bitch fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, trying to move on,
trying to have a good week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to talk about cannabis here,
but I want to talk a little bit first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know that I hit my head at the
beginning of April, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is now, I'm recording this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The date is May 14th as we record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm getting it back together
so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I want to thank you for
tolerating my bullshit while I've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: head wound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've been goofy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys that stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being there while I was kind of
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about a product I ordered
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been taking something called
AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it at OnIt.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two N's in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's O-N-N-I-T.
[SPEAKER_02]: OnIt Labs makes a lot of great products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to reach for my bottle of
AlphaBrain right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the bottle in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: AlphaBrain is a complete earth-grown
nootropic with Alpha GPC and AC-11.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to you guys, but they say that
[SPEAKER_02]: lecturers, educators, public speakers,
radio personalities, and folks like that
[SPEAKER_02]: use AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that inspired me to use it is Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Joe Rogan does his podcast,
he takes a couple of AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he does the UFC events, he announces,
commentates on the UFCs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does three AlphaBrain pills for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been taking two a day and I can feel
a sharpness in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: My vocabulary is stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a problem after I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would try to recall words and I'd say,
hey, can you hand me my... And I just
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't think of what basic words were
like screwdriver or flashlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I would just forget words,
but the AlphaBrain is making that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: come back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making me a better speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making me remember and recall more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making me calmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've described it as... Maybe I've said
this on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm full of shit with my memory
thing, but I've described it as my brain
[SPEAKER_02]: has the main track that's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the, you got to wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to brush your teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get to work on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to do your chores.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to call this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That track is playing in your head,
but there's always that side bullshit that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes on in your head, like taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just whispers at you occasionally,
or I wonder what that girl's doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I miss somebody, or just bullshit that
happens in your head that you really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be focusing on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like weird things pop up into your
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the AlphaBrain has kind of quieted
that secondary track.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where I'm able to focus on what I'm
supposed to focus on, which gets me to my
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcasts are getting much better,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make the podcast a lot
better, much, much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to On It Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take two a day and I definitely feel,
I'm more talkative, but it's because my
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts are more clear and I can put
together much better sentences,
[SPEAKER_02]: much better podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude, I got the phone on loud here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put that bitch on silent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very unprofessional podcast
behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the phone on silent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk about another product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard us talk about Floria on a
previous podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floria is a medicated personal lubricant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means it's a sexual lubricant that
contains cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody heard that I talked about it on
the show and they gave me a product called
[SPEAKER_02]: Evos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I can tell, Evos and Floria
are very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairly similar was what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are both coconut oil infused with
cannabis and they are meant to be applied
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, the instructions pretty much
say apply it to the female's parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be straight up about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Evos and I sprayed it up on my
partner's goods and it made a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely, there was nothing to
complain about before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was going just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we added that stuff, it made it a
little, it made my junk warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like it's already warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it felt a little warmer and
tingling or it made my stuff feel a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more alert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was definitely a heightened
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said that it was definitely a
heightened experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just coconut oil and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had no worries about putting it on my
body or in her body or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It washed off really cleanly and really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One funny thing that I said when I was
done, and I'm sorry if I'm being too
[SPEAKER_02]: explicit you guys, but it's my podcast and
I'll talk about my dick if I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was done, I was, I felt,
I wasn't aroused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all done and soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all floppy, but I felt like my dick
was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've given somebody a massage with
Apothecana lotion before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've explained my hands, like feeling
like I was wearing Mickey Mouse gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dick felt like it was fluffy,
like to the touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I would touch it, I felt like it was
thicker than it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a weird, okay, enough about my dong
on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tried the Evos and if you're looking
for something to add to the bedroom fun
[SPEAKER_02]: and you want to go to the dispensary and
spend a few bucks, there's nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: with Evos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening, let's do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about Evos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's change the tone a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that is not good that
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to explain to a friend
something and I don't know the science
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it, but I know that this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: When my dab rig gets dirty, my chunk of
globby resin in there, and this probably
[SPEAKER_02]: applies to the bong with bong resin,
if you're just smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've noticed that when I'm hitting the
dab rig, once the rig gets dirty,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that chunk of resin in there
is actually stealing part of my dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when you've got a big floater,
if you look at my rig right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is like a quarter gram of hash just
floating in my rig water and it's not oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rig water has only been in there for
three or four days at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just dab heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The C-Nail never turns off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the coffee pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns on at a certain time in the
morning and then it goes off right when I
[SPEAKER_02]: go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm taking big fat globs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll clean the rig and take fat globs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fat globs, I get super baked just like I
should.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as the rig gets dirtier, I stop
getting as high and stop choking and stop
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoying my dab as much as it gets
dirtier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that chunk of resin in there
collects the resin, the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It collects all your cannabinoids and your
smoke and whatever you're trying to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sticks to that ball and it's ripping
you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point, clean your fucking rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get some rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's really super sticky, get yourself
some kosher salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill the rig halfway up with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little bit of kosher salt in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The salt is working as an abrasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to scratch all that resin off
of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover up both holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go somewhere where you got a carpeted
floor if you're a pothead and just shake
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit out of that rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we're going to the carpeted
floor is so that when you drop the rig,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a better chance of living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go shake the shit out of that rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, I know it's disgusting,
but just pour all that fucking reclaimed
[SPEAKER_02]: right down the drain and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people that use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hate on you if you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't use it, especially if you just
mix alcohol into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But flush that shit right down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then rinse the rig out a couple of
times with super hot water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it cool down to a normal temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill it back up with water the right
depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The right amount of water, whatever the
right level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw your nail on there and get down on
some clean, tasty dabs and enjoy the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor of your dabs again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think a clean rig is more
important than people realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough of that PSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got more shit written down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was asking me, I got an email or
a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot recall where it came from right
now, but somebody was asking me about rig
[SPEAKER_02]: selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I choose a good rig?
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, if you're dabbing,
I prefer a small rig over a big piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we used to smoke pot out of a
giant bong is so that you can fill all
[SPEAKER_02]: that space with a big, thick, chunky hit
of smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you pull that carb or you
pull the bowl out or you take your finger
[SPEAKER_02]: off, however you carve your bowl,
your bong, if you're from the 70s,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just take your finger off that hole in
the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're from the future, you got to pull
the stem out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you carve it, you're supposed to get
all that fucking smoke into your lungs
[SPEAKER_02]: right at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got a big old bong hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you get baked from the
bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill that piece, clear it, get all your
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're smoking dabs, your dab is just
burning up right when you put it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: nail and you start smoking and you're
getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we need a big ass piece for
a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a little tiny rig to where when you
put it on there, you put the carb cap on
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you inhale, you get that smoke
right to your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to build a whole bunch of
smoke into one chamber and then clear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want that dab to go through the
rig, through the water to cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then into your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my main recommendation is something
kind of small.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite rig, and you're going to think
I'm crazy, but my favorite rig is my
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitman Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the right height.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that's probably five inches
tall, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go up to the mouthpiece,
it's probably seven inches tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my Mad Rob rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucker is probably four inches tall
at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a lot of percolation on a
rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something that gets plenty
of bubbles, you don't need a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: diffusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you want to do is cool your dab smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it coming off of that hot
nail directly into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put a little water through there,
just enough to cool it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like a lot of water on my rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I think over percolation on a
dab, if you've got too many sections of
[SPEAKER_02]: water, you're kind of overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the Toro cans that have the tree
perk, and then it's got the little shower
[SPEAKER_02]: head perk in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my favorite is the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do like the mothership rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things hit like a boss, but you're
looking at like 2,500 to 3,000 for a rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're asking me for advice,
you don't need advice on a mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself a nice Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid of, you don't have to buy
name brand glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep in mind that if you're buying
Chinese made glass, there's probably some
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese little kid making it in unsafe
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have good eye protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably barefoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can buy some American glass and
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the extra few bucks just to
know that you have ethically made glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's some karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, Hitman's a good company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't support the show or anything,
but they're always innovators.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lead the glass game in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go expensive, get yourself
a coil or some beer glass or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coil is going to be ridiculous,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just talking about my favorite rigs
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I'm going to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a small rig without a lot of
percolation, something that keeps the nail
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit away from your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're checking out these rigs at the
store, try to put the nail that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to buy right on that rig and then
see how far away that nail is from your
[SPEAKER_02]: face because I don't really like the nail
higher than the mouthpiece or real right
[SPEAKER_02]: in my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed a couple inches away from my nose
so that I can see where I'm putting the
[SPEAKER_02]: dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The important part, the most important
part when you're buying a rig is the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're heating up to a couple
hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're putting your extract
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be heated and cooled and
heated and cooled all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm burping here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a drink right quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for the silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a good quality titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only brand I will recommend for
titanium is Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a nail for your rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what you're trying to do,
Highly Educated has got the perfect nail
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need guidance on the nail,
hit me up, send me a picture of your rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what kind of nail to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do really like the quartz nails if you
get a good quality quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend the Halen Honey Hole if you do
big fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into smoking solventless and
BHO, definitely get the Honey Hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds a lot of heat for when you smoke
solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of room to get a big
solventless dab in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like the Quave Banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Quave Banger is going to be a little
bit pricey, but they are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They taste super clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who just made the trough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Joel Halen that just made the
trough?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not had a chance to try the trough
yet, but they look amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's made out of good quality quartz,
I bet it's going to be a good quartz
[SPEAKER_02]: banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a company that is selling,
they call them quartz bangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the nail that it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a faucet spout kind of with
a little bucket at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put your dab in the bucket part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, there's a company that's selling
those that's claiming they're quartz and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to buy glass and reheat it
and let it cool and reheat it and let it
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to break.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a good quartz piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quartz can handle the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we go back to that stuff talking
about what's made in America, what's made
[SPEAKER_02]: in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to do that with your quartz products
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a Halen Honey Hole, get a real Quave
Banger, or get yourself a real highly
[SPEAKER_02]: educated titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only nails I will support on
this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on guys, send me some nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all the nails I can use right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good nail is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, recently I discovered something that
the people in Colorado may be excited
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally, Kind Love in Denver has
occasionally been putting out clones of my
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually bought seeds from me at an
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought several packages of seeds and
they ran the Lemon Jeffrey and they found
[SPEAKER_02]: their phenotypes that are killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tested from the 24 to 26s and they
actually said that they could have grown
[SPEAKER_02]: the herb better, but there was an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that next time you're going to
see 28 to 29% on the Lemon Jeffrey from
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally, you can pick up Lemon
Jeffrey clones at Kind Love and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're big, fat, healthy, luscious
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely recommend that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call before you drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not reserve a clone for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to call.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to say, do they have this clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they say yes, then you got to get in
the car and haul ass over there because
[SPEAKER_02]: they will not reserve a clone for you,
but they might have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I feel like I'm talking a
million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause, take a dab,
and then we're going to get into some
[SPEAKER_02]: news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be right back, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to Task
and Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me use the music on the
show, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about some news,
like I said, but to lead into the news,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk a little bit about a comedy
show that I went to recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint and I were bragging that we got to
go see the taping of Doug Loves Movies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Benson is a weed comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a show called Doug Loves Movies
where they play games.
[SPEAKER_02]: He usually brings three comedians or some
level of superstars to the show with him
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are his contestants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They play for the audience and the
audience will win the prizes based on who
[SPEAKER_02]: wins in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Loves Movies came to ComedyWorks in
downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know how much I love ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the entire crew there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me for that giant cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt that coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint drove me up there because like I
said, my transmission is fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint drove us up there and got us to the
Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always feed us well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got us to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to see the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about Doug's last show not being
up to standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time we laughed our asses off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He completely, completely made up for the
lack of funny in the last show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm catching my breath after that
cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took some pretty gnarly dabs while we were
off the air there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you guys were listening to that
commercial about the worm company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am going to read this article
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to catch my breath before
I do it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Benson, he pulled off a great show,
a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can listen to the exact episode if you
go to iTunes, search for Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The episode actually is titled something
about, I'm going to look at my phone right
[SPEAKER_02]: here just so that I can tell you
accurately what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got this iPhone, takes a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, holy crap, he does a lot of
episodes, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's titled Jeff Tate, Julian McCullough,
and Ricardo Vaca Guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was put up on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out if you want to,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sitting in the front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friends at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe somebody an apology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I got to fix that sound equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this shit spiked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe somebody an apology at ComedyWorks,
a patron.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gifted the luxury of kind of a
lifetime VIP pass for ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I call ahead and let my friend
know that I'm coming, I can get a VIP seat
[SPEAKER_02]: in the front row, let them know how many
of us there will be, and they'll put me in
[SPEAKER_02]: the front row as long as I've got tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made arrangements to have my front row
privileges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it was time to seat us,
the seating people kind of looked at each
[SPEAKER_02]: other with some concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one guy said, you fucked up,
you go tell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one seating person, I don't know
what he's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to call him an usher.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one usher dude had to go tell two
people that they had to move because the
[SPEAKER_02]: seats that they were sitting in up front
had been reserved for Doug's VIP special
[SPEAKER_02]: guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt bad for that because those people
probably waited in line for a good hour
[SPEAKER_02]: while I was at the Mellow Mushroom eating
pizza or in the car taking fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Claude the Candy Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate a Sweet Stone Candy, a Claudey Bear
before I went into the show, about two
[SPEAKER_02]: hours before the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by show time, woohoo, I was sweet
stoned for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to go and move these two
people because I've got this VIP pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sit, Clint and I, in the most
prime fucking seats in the club,
[SPEAKER_02]: right up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could feel hatred.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were staring at us like we were
huge dicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually the guy sitting next
to us got tired of the tension and he just
[SPEAKER_02]: said, so who the fuck are you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Clint said, nobody, I'm with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, who are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, we're just friends of
Doug's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, yeah, they moved our
friends because you guys are Doug's
[SPEAKER_02]: special guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt kind of like a shit head for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do apologize, but I had a great ass
time up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good ass show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go and read this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking for a long time about it
and I've just got an article written.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was excited because what Doug does,
dude, excuse all the coughing and throat
[SPEAKER_02]: clearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took some gnarly dabs of some
Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that was the last one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the dab, the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was excited because when he announced
his guests, he said Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew who that was right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of our news on this show is
written by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this says,
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course this came out May 11th and it
was in The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's written by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says,
[SPEAKER_02]: Comic Doug Benson, also a legit weed hero,
had generously asked me to be a guest on
[SPEAKER_02]: his movie podcast, Doug Loves Movies,
after seeing the marijuana journalism
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary, Rolling Papers, at the South
by Southwest Film Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump in right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned Rolling Papers, a movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: A camera crew followed, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ricardo Baca, around for a year and
followed members of his staff and part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: They followed him for an entire year and
recorded and made a documentary about the
[SPEAKER_02]: journalism, marijuana journalism that is
developed in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've dubbed the movie Rolling
Papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was purchased after its first showing
at the South by Southwest Festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming out in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep you guys updated when that comes
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse all the coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weed show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're coughing with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the article goes on to say,
and then the nerves came on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people listen to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, but after meeting my fellow
guests, Wipsmart comedians, Jeff Tate and
[SPEAKER_02]: Julian McCullough, and seeing Benson
again, I knew we were in for a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcast taping was a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sold out crowd at ComedyWorks was
super rad and Benson's team took less than
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours to launch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he means the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everyone can listen via the
embedded Doug Loves Movies site or iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you go to douglovesmovies.com
or go to iTunes, you can listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great, great podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ricardo Baca did quite damn well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on stage with three witty top level
comedians and he held his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did not try to step up and be a
comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He remained Ricardo Baca and I respected
him for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He let the comedians comedy and he did his
job and was the person that they invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, my throat is tickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause for a second and
I'll be right back with another news
[SPEAKER_02]: article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys wouldn't believe what I just spit
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have took a picture of that for
you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have recorded the sound of that
hitting wherever it landed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a side note on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strain of the day is golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: People often credit me for making the
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not invent the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I simply put it into feminized seed for
the world to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat was created by Mr. Dank in
Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm catching my breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can hear that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are going to read another news
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fix some recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blowing some shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the air conditioner next to me
and I don't think you guys can hear it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the recording equipment is struggling
to keep me and this fucking air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioner separate in the recording
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty neat watching the lights light
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this one hits close to home
because I do live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am actually the grower at a very popular
dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo West is like a sub development just
outside of the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 10 minutes to the west.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously it's Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know that it's exactly
completely a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's newer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't have old town problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the old rickety parts of
town.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks a lot nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a part that we call the
county, which if you drive outside of city
[SPEAKER_02]: limits, there are a lot of stores and
shopping areas in the county and the
[SPEAKER_02]: county and Pueblo West are allowed to have
dispensaries, but the city of Pueblo has
[SPEAKER_02]: not been allowed dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read an article that came out
May 12th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I really do apologize for this
throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took some gnarly dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll quit taking so many dabs on the show
so that you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, come be on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk while I'm clearing my throat and you
guys can give me a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: This article says Pueblo pot shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Voters will decide whether to allow retail
sales in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only by the APs who gets credit for
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo lawmakers are letting the voters
decide whether to allow recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana shops in their city.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pueblo Chieftain reports concerned
residents filled the city council chambers
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday night, many wearing yellow shirts
that said, voice your choice and urging
[SPEAKER_02]: their elected officials to put the issue
to voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilman Bob Schilling was the only vote
in favor of licensing retail pot shops,
[SPEAKER_02]: but said that he hasn't opposed a vote in
November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several of the six council members who
voted against adopting the ordinance had
[SPEAKER_02]: been in favor before the public hearing,
including president Steve Narake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the issue isn't worth dividing the
public over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did vote and they did decide to push
back the vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no recreational or medical
marijuana shops in the city of Pueblo
[SPEAKER_02]: until they vote again, which will be in
November.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, if you live in Pueblo,
you have to drive 15 minutes to the county
[SPEAKER_02]: or to Pueblo West to go purchase your
cannabis and then drive back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the city that you live in isn't
getting your tax money for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're able to purchase because of
these stupid fucking regulations that
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo has been juggling with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in the legal medical marijuana
industry in this city since... Should we
[SPEAKER_02]: had the first shop?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was nine years ago when we
had Metamar downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since that is closed, there has not
been another medical shop or a
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational shop in the city that was
legally licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been places that popped up
randomly and were closed, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't use the word retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mean to the retarded people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's ridiculous and stupid that we
are not allowed to have a recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis shop within city limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need the tax money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This town is broke and hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of weed money would really help
this city.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another news article that I found
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, a Castle Rock man pleads guilty
to mailing Colorado pot across the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is written by Anthony Cotton of
the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was published May 12th.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to catch on right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point when I start reading this,
it says, a Castle Rock man pleaded guilty
[SPEAKER_02]: on charges that included sending more than
a hundred packages that included marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: to locations across the country and
receiving several hundred thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: through the mail and return.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the United States District
Attorney's office, Brian Daniel Evans,
[SPEAKER_02]: age 42, began mailing pot packages in
April of 2014 and continued through that
[SPEAKER_02]: fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Evans pleaded guilty this April.
[SPEAKER_02]: Officials said Evans first came under
suspicion on April 2nd, 2014, when the U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Postal Inspector came across a suspicious
mailing that may have contained narcotics
[SPEAKER_02]: or narcotic proceeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first package in question came from
Missouri and it contained cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That package was sent to a commercial mail
receiving agency mailbox and was addressed
[SPEAKER_02]: to an individual in Loan Tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: An ongoing investigation traced a car
under surveillance to Evans, who was also
[SPEAKER_02]: seen mailing parcels from post offices in
the metro area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Officials said inspectors also conducted a
search of Elvin's apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That search recovered 580 grams of bagged
marijuana, 800 grams of marijuana extract
[SPEAKER_02]: or hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's a lot of hash oil,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's close to two pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,480 grams of marijuana edibles for a
total weight of 6,860 grams of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys heard that stupid shit in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,480 grams of marijuana edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fucking weighing the brownies and
charging him with the weight of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking brownies for the grams of pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking whack, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like weighing the baggie too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a shitty drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole article is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy should not have done that,
but that part right there is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to continue the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: A search of his vehicle found an
additional 78 grams of liquid marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably had some tincture,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had previously mailed two additional
packages that were seized by law
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those packages contained 3,654 grams of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: In total, inspectors learned that Elvin
sent 11,026 grams of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Law enforcement also had seized during the
investigation more than $53,000 in cash,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was the proceeds from his illegal
narcotics transaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That money was forfeited to the government
as part of Elvin's plea agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elvin's pled guilty to three counts of
possession of a controlled substance with
[SPEAKER_02]: the intent to distribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: He now faces more than 20 years in federal
prison and up to a $1 million fine per
[SPEAKER_02]: count.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point here, people, is quit mailing
weed out of Colorado, unless you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: end up in federal prison doing 20 years
and facing up to $1 million in fines per
[SPEAKER_02]: count.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several reasons we shouldn't be
mailing cannabis out of the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, it's illegal and you're going
to go to prison and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: butt raped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't sound like fun to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't sound like the fucking profit I'm
making from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second of all, in Colorado, the people
that have fought hard to legalize cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: medically and recreationally, we did it
for here and you're fucking it up by
[SPEAKER_02]: mailing it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever you're sending it, they're
responsible for legalizing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: their area, not us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by sending it out, you're fucking up
what we worked hard for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making something shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a system that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've created laws and we're playing by
the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to be a fucking
shithead and take the rules that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow and smoke all the weed you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hustle weed in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quit sending it out of state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking it up, making everybody
look bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to get caught and get
butt raped and go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read about you in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep sending that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will proudly read your name and laugh at
you on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't send cannabis out of state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys get it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalize cannabis everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact your local Congress people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that shit where you are and get it
legalized in your area so that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to get... And there's not enough herb
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are hurting for herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are patients that want cannabis that
don't have any medicine here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're sending that shit to other
states to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the money out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put more compassion into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I have for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just chat for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have promised you a scheduling episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I was going to do an episode
about scheduling your grow for a perpetual
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am writing it, but I had an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a stumbling block.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many lights you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how to write a perpetual
cycle for your room, but I have found a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm writing it based on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll probably be one or two episodes
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other episode I have been teasing
about is improving your gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say top 10 ways to improve
your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got about 30 ways written down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is definitely coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to talk too much about any of
that stuff because we'll just save it for
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out again to
Clint and Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to everybody who has helped
me deal with not having a car this week or
[SPEAKER_02]: this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a real pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if we had some plans that I had
to cancel or rearrange, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a blown transmission.
[SPEAKER_02]: My chevrolet legs will get me so far,
but the weather has been shitty and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to come to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to take some dads or if you
want to be on the podcast, you got to come
[SPEAKER_02]: to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you pay a lot more attention to
a 35, 40 minute episode than you do those
[SPEAKER_02]: hour shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Stitcher or iTunes or Twitter or
Facebook or email me and tell me if you
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer the 30 minute episodes over the
hour long episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's better when I do two 30
minute episodes instead of the long hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys really listen more.
[SPEAKER_02]: My throat doesn't fuck up as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have a guest, we'll go an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it's just me, I'm going to try to
go about 30 and try to do two episodes a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, in my opinion, let me know what
you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show isn't just for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show is a lot for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be back in a few days with another
episode, probably about ways to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: your garden.
