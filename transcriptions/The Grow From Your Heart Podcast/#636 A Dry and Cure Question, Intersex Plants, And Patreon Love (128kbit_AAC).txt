Pass the love just like you do a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So support my friends on the neighborhood
grows The next order of business we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about here is I am a shit talker
When it comes to smoking rosin boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a big fan of rosin 75% of the
time your rosin tastes like a popsicle
[SPEAKER_00]: stick or burnt popcorn and I Cannot stand
the fucking flavor of a popsicle stick on
[SPEAKER_00]: my tongue If you put a tongue depressor on
my tongue popsicle stick on my tongue I
[SPEAKER_00]: can feel it in my bones in my body right
now this weird They call it the chills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an uncomfortable fucking feeling I
got I don't know if you call it chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: skins or goosebumps Whatever the fuck you
call it wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My skin's crawling doing weird shit I
don't like a tongue depressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that unfinished wood texture
in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disgusting a lot of times That's what
rosin tastes like to me burnt popcorn and
[SPEAKER_00]: a tongue depressor and it makes my tongue
in my face make this terrible shape I go
[SPEAKER_00]: oh And you can tell by looking that it
looks like I just took a bite of poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pleasant Anyway, I did take a dab
of some rosin the past couple of days that
[SPEAKER_00]: was made by a friend That was a gift that
we can't talk too much about how it landed
[SPEAKER_00]: here and who got it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: However They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about another product in a
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend wondered if this was him this
time, bro I am talking about your rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a nice buzz from it It was heavy on
the lungs and the flavor changed so many
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two jars one Honestly is not my
favorite, but it's smokable the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back for more so I do approve I do
enjoy the rosin you guys are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better The rosin makers are getting better
at making rosin is what I've noticed your
[SPEAKER_00]: Lord Burning the temperatures the times
the techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all being dialed in and it's getting
better that being said I'm still a batter
[SPEAKER_00]: fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing nothing better than some
good green dot batter They do not pay me
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that actually I just go buy all my
product at the dispensary just like you do
[SPEAKER_00]: green dot doesn't email me message me We
have no relationship good product,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason I'm stoned is rent and rambly
is because of the I can't think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the strain that I smoked but it
was some rosin and it was delicious It'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was some I don't want to say
the wrong one I know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain will not allow me to say it by
the end of this episode Maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: remember or I'll press pause go find it
then tell you the real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one word It's one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the name of it just won't come to
my head because I'm fucking plenty stone
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I could use your help I do a
lot of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting out a lot here I'd like some
feedback some replies some information
[SPEAKER_00]: this I guess is what we're going to call
the call to action in this episode It is
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out today driving around running
some errands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice I'm not wearing a hoodie No
long-sleeve shirt in this episode rocking
[SPEAKER_00]: a t-shirt and jeans and sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is finally freakin nice outside It is
the springtime spring is upon us People
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking lovely out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunshine has got people in a good mood
Also, they're driving like a dipshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's beside the point What I'm
getting at is I want to make some spring
[SPEAKER_00]: and summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics and grow from your heart
merchandise However, that is not my niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the best at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm better at podcasting I'm better at
being in the grow making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things I should focus on So
I'm gonna ask you for help somewhere out
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a clothing designer somebody with
some cool artwork somebody that says it is
[SPEAKER_00]: my turn to step up and help rasta Jeff
What I'm looking for is some spring
[SPEAKER_00]: apparel designs things I can have printed
in mass That aren't super expensive and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can put them on my Etsy store and get them
out to the people So they can rock some
[SPEAKER_00]: new designs for the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have the green and the orange shirts
Those are gonna look good for spring and
[SPEAKER_00]: summer That purple shirt will look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll replenish those but we need some new
designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe brand new merch new ideas I've
expired expended exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've exhausted my brain on merge ideas I'm
more focused on growing breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like your help What do you want
with the I read genetics branding on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you rock with the podcast logo
on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that is not my My avenue my
route my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm better at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna focus here and I'm asking for
yours Help what merchandise is next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think I could put out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to put out merchandise that
works.

with the seeds I put out shirts are cool
[SPEAKER_00]: Hats are cool stuff like that is great
stickers and things are awesome But what
[SPEAKER_00]: are some other products maybe that you
could see branded that you think would be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to you and me as well And we
could work together and get them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I made my my piece
clear there You know what?

just a little basic request for some help
[SPEAKER_00]: with merchandise, but Fuck, you know me we
take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to jump into these
patreon messages I think I've covered all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the important part at the start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, we've got a message that came
from patreon This one comes from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Sacred tree organic farms and it
says what's up rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been keeping up to date on each show
and I appreciate the hard work But I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't heard from you in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a busy guy I really just wanted to
make sure you're getting my contribution
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you got my messages about my
business name being shouted out so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: address two things here right now,
which are great things to talk about Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get your message about giving you
the shout out for the correct name Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: recap that in a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that I give you shout out
Based on the names I've got on patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what name you signed up under
I don't know what your real name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your surname I've got your
name from patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Instagram a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got your patreon name here on a
paper That's what I give you a shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to because that's the info I have got if
you'd like me to shout out a different
[SPEAKER_00]: name You've got to message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will print out the paper that says hey
shout me out at this I'll try to correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: the two names on the paper and remember to
start using your requested shout out So
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend at sacred sacred tree organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, brother I did receive your request to
be shouted out as sacred tree organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a big moment Give a big salute
a grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends It's sacred tree
organic farms for their continued support
[SPEAKER_00]: through patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something else I want to address
while I've got this topic open I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I covered this Getting your
support you got your shout out big love
[SPEAKER_00]: big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says take care brother,
bro You take care as well and thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Opening so that I can
open up this box and talk about this topic
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the part I want to talk about is um
There's one of me and there are over 250
[SPEAKER_00]: patrons at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for each and every one of you
But it is hard to give each and every one
[SPEAKER_00]: of you undivided attention So if you've
sent me an email if you have sent me a
[SPEAKER_00]: request a message I don't hate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you with all of my heart from the
bottom of my long dreadlocks I love and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate each and every one of you But
my inboxes have just become ridiculous and
[SPEAKER_00]: unmanageable I'm trying I'm doing my best
you guys I get so many messages patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a priority of course because you
do send funding with that I feel like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you send money I should pay attention to
you first you paid for me to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: messages I do what I don't want is people
to think that they're giving me financial
[SPEAKER_00]: support And I'm ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am getting a lot of support a lot of
messages and there are 250 patrons 30,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram followers 60 something thousand
cannabis followers plus the 14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: unanswered emails in my inbox and the
thing about emails that I've discovered I
[SPEAKER_00]: will sit here at this table and put on
music just loud enough not to distract me
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get me focused I'll take a couple
of dabs to get me in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get some snacks in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just shoving snacks Into my mouth
and answering emails hours will go by I
[SPEAKER_00]: will have answered a couple of hundred
emails and then guess what happens Those
[SPEAKER_00]: people all reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like every hundred emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send 50 more reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only catch up halfway I'm not
complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sign of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sign of longevity, but I don't
want you guys to feel like you're being
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored or Neglected or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't stop with the message,
but be patient with me realize it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: me, dude That's why it's quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could people say hire an intern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hire somebody to help you I don't
believe or trust that anybody will have
[SPEAKER_00]: the passion enthusiasm the care the eye
for detail for the seed company the emails
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast It's all got to be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's successful Maybe that's an
ego thing, but I know it's working now The
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that's lacking is I'm not
getting enough done But as a business
[SPEAKER_00]: owner, if you can't catch up with the
work, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you've got a business that's
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flowing When I take a break and go
I'm bored all my work's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Please don't ever feel like I'm
ignoring you disrespecting you blowing you
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am up late I start my day by answering
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finish my day by answering messages my
girlfriend's like hey Do you ever stop
[SPEAKER_00]: working and I'm like, I wish like I'm
totally paying attention to you But also
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to answer these patreon messages
So shout out to her for being awesome and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting up with the 24-hour work But also
you guys I'm trying and I think I've made
[SPEAKER_00]: my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just stunned and ready I love you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a drink
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I did cover that topic quite
well we beat the shit out of that dead
[SPEAKER_00]: horse Let's move on to another topic that
is more grow focused something we could
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about and learn something here This
one came from our friend since the 11 on
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon big shout out to my buddy since
the 11 sends me a lot of great messages We
[SPEAKER_00]: did talk about some other stuff and I
replied why I don't do it and he replied
[SPEAKER_00]: with good point haters suck That was part
of a private conversation But you're very
[SPEAKER_00]: correct brother haters do suck shout out
to all my haters out there If you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching this out of hatred out of spite,
I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well I hope you gain
success and I hope you have a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: life hug a hater send them on their way
Now this message goes I do have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas for episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that This one says I've got a two
by four two foot by four foot not a two
[SPEAKER_00]: inch by four inch But a two foot by four
foot dry and cure tent so they've taken a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent and they've modified it And set
it up to be their drying space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're drying their chopped down flowers
in this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I Have now found that if you use a
two by four tent with exhaust you can
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust with a duct fan Into a four inch
carbon filter for like five to ten days
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are hanging down during this
period then you can take them off the
[SPEAKER_00]: strings use plastic bins and leave them in
there just Then take them off the strings
[SPEAKER_00]: leave them just enough of a stem to trim
with then let them sit in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment With the plastic bins on the
ground for five to ten more days Then trim
[SPEAKER_00]: it and jar it burp with burp for three
weeks daily leaving in the tent This
[SPEAKER_00]: method has worked well and is simple and
easy That's a great idea That is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to use a grow tent a lot of us are
growing in the grow tent and don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to dry and cure That tent that you
grew in would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just modify it a little bit Don't turn on
the light because we don't need the light
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like our friend said use an exhaust
so that you're sucking out all that stale
[SPEAKER_00]: air I use a carbon filter so you're not
spreading that Intense aroma around
[SPEAKER_00]: because once you harvest the smell is
fucking intense Once you start rustling
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes around moving the plants
around it really gets stinky So you got
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow tent you got your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your blower in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sucking out the stale air You're
bringing in fresh air a little bit of air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement is good not ridiculous air
movement in there You don't want it
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you've got the right idea
They're hanging upside down, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal Take them off the string use clean
plastic bins and leave just enough of a
[SPEAKER_00]: stem to trim With that's sounds ideal to
me basically similar to what we would do
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial environment I'll talk on
that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them sit in the same environment in
the plastic bins on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Something the only thing you're not
doing that I do in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is I put a humidifier and a
dehumidifier in that room I don't use a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent I have a room with locks and cameras
and shit But I put those divide I put a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier and dehumidifier in the same
room and set them both at 50% and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fight that way it is always 50%
humidity in that room if you can control
[SPEAKER_00]: the Temperature that would be ideal as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this is in your home But it
sounds like you're doing the right thing
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave them for so you've got them hanging
for five to ten days on the ground for
[SPEAKER_00]: five to ten more days That's gonna be 14
20 ish days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right about the right time period
Then trim it and jar it then burp three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks daily leaving in the tent At this
point you could take them out of the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wanted to put them on a shelf or
whatever but if you want To leave them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method has worked well and is simple
and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes That's a great idea because a lot of
people don't have dry and cure space They
[SPEAKER_00]: did not plan for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not prep for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know where they're gonna do it
So that tent is a great space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just utilize that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already paid rent already bought
the gear It may slow you down two weeks on
[SPEAKER_00]: your next crop But if you're not looking
for production if you're just running this
[SPEAKER_00]: small crop, that is a beautiful idea since
the 11 Thank you for the great idea If you
[SPEAKER_00]: got any more questions rather I do look
forward To hearing from you guys use that
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got guys and gals use the space
You've got the only thing I would do
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add that humidifier and
dehumidifier But you might be in just the
[SPEAKER_00]: right area to where you don't need to do
that I've got an area in my basement that
[SPEAKER_00]: is perfect for drying and curing plants I
don't have to had or subtract anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants just fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we get lucky All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says if not bad genetics,
what causes hermaphrodites or intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very very good question Most of
the time if we see intersex traits in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, we immediately blame genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either genetics or grower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two things that could have
been But there's something we often
[SPEAKER_00]: overlook and my buddy James Bean calls it
the Jurassic Park effect and I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with that The bottom line is life
finds a way Cannabis is an annual plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that is designed to live for one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to veg flower produce seeds
die the seeds Grow next year annual plan
[SPEAKER_00]: one season one year We have developed
plants that don't produce pollen and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce any seeds because they are since
Amelia plants We take we've taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: males out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no seeds in the female plants
These plants know there's no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're not getting pollen a
female plants whole goal in life is to get
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated That's all she wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's her sole purpose is to get pollinated
and make seeds so that we can continue can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this generation or This brand
this seed line however, whatever label you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put on it This brand of seeds can
continue for generations and generations
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants whole idea is to drop
loads of pollen on those female plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue his bloodline That's why the male
plant gets taller the pollen falls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plants are lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They receive the pollen They make seeds
the season ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either get frozen They fall to the
ground and die the wind drops them down
[SPEAKER_00]: the birds eat them shit up the seeds
somewhere else seeds are scattered
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly chaotically just like pollen So
that's not happening in our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simply not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have bees We don't have a lot of
things happening in there these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: know the female plants are like fucking
horny I've been in this room for this many
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in flower around week three I
really should have got jizzed on and got
[SPEAKER_00]: filled up with seeds, but that didn't
happen I'm like nine weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My trichomes are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: My leaves are weird the season changed in
here He's got it nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He changed the fucking light cycle I don't
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna die and I didn't get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna get to make babies watch
this and so that plant just goes boink and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes a fucking seed because Life finds
a way just like Jurassic Park broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only had female plants, but are they
only had female dinosaurs, but somehow One
[SPEAKER_00]: of them female dinosaurs some immaculate
conception some some biblical shit
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and there are more dinosaurs
Cannabis plants work just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will create their own seed It will
create their own pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what causes herms so Stress will do
it Bad genetics will do it overfeeding
[SPEAKER_00]: underfeeding terrible environment will do
it but letting it go way too long Will
[SPEAKER_00]: also do it if you let if that plant should
have been chopped down at week 8 and you
[SPEAKER_00]: let it go to week 10 or 11 it will
hermaphrodite on you a lot of things can
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to intersex traits and
hermaphroditism it should have been washed
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the breeding it should Have been
selected better that should have been
[SPEAKER_00]: before we gave you seeds or spread them
out We should have realized there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: trait in there that needs to be bred out
or the seeds need to be tossed but Any
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has the opportunity to show an
intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got the will to Survive life will
find a way and shout out to my buddy James
[SPEAKER_00]: Bean for coining that Jurassic Park term I
don't know if he made that up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is who I heard it from life will
find a way just like Jurassic Park so If
[SPEAKER_00]: not bad genetics, what are some causes of
hermaphrodites the will to survive bro is
[SPEAKER_00]: the main cause for hermaphrodites It's not
just bad genetics sometimes grow or error
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep in mind that a lot of the
chem dog stuff a lot of the og stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: prone to being hermaphroditic to showing
intersex traits It's up to us to not give
[SPEAKER_00]: it the opportunity We know that certain
things in the room will trigger that
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeeding it underfeeding it too much
cold drastic temperature swings shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that stress at all Will cause a chem 91 or
a real old-school og kush plant to just go
[SPEAKER_00]: herm on you over watering it Over watering
an og kush plant can cause it to turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already was intersex It'll cause it to
show the intersex trait So a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: can trigger that you can grow plants
several several times And just one new
[SPEAKER_00]: thing can really piss it off and make it
display that intersex trait for you All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a long message I'm going to
cut to the chase once I start Reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name said
because I do You'll understand why it says
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you this finds you Well,
I've had issues maintaining a constant
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and keeping humidity up in my
tents I will set the stage for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: better help you wrap your head around this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that approach I will end with the
steps I plan on taking to look forward
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I will end with the steps I plan on
taking and I look forward to hearing from
[SPEAKER_00]: your expertise So this is a great way to
set up an email it says I have two tents
[SPEAKER_00]: in a room that is as sealed as can be
while maintaining an inconspicuous outside
[SPEAKER_00]: view That's fucking understandable in my
veg tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two LEDs and then we talk a little
bit about the grow Then we come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: main problem of the grow the room itself
has temperature fluctuations We can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: the room much lower than 83 degrees I have
taken more of a MacGyver approach for this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and I would like to avoid bringing
in AC units expensive regulators and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's what it has to be then so be
it It says so far my steps have been
[SPEAKER_00]: placing buckets of water with an air pump
and stone in the tents That's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make it cool You need cool says I moved my
flower tent to the coldest part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room away from the basic Radiator to have
to maintain minimum heat which it
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously didn't work then it says I'm a
brand new grower and I've listened to your
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of grow tips four times and I
would like to have a nice setup before I
[SPEAKER_00]: start my new seeds any criticism is
appreciated and Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um So I had a lot to say about this
message and then I just cut right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro You can do all kinds of
magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hope and pray you can move shit
around the answer is By an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you dodging an air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make this job as hard as you want
you can make this grow as challenging as
[SPEAKER_00]: you want on yourself or You already said
it I could buy an air conditioner You've
[SPEAKER_00]: already brought buckets into the room and
put bubblers and shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're moving things around You're trying
to do MacGyver tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the store and buy the air
conditioner and install the AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said By the air conditioner bro,
and then he said an update I buckled and
[SPEAKER_00]: got a regular AC Unit and I said,
sorry for the slow reply But you have made
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct move sometimes in a grow
environment You have just got to bite the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet and get the correct gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try to MacGyver stuff You can duct
tape stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rig stuff up however you want But
every bud you grow every half-ass larvae
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffy nugget that you produce is going to
show That your grow room was not what it
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your flaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your weakest link Why are you
gonna let that weak link that chink in the
[SPEAKER_00]: armor the fucking the weak part be the
weak part, you know it that's Fix that you
[SPEAKER_00]: did you did you stepped up?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying anybody out there
who's thinking like this It is springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about to go into summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the time to be joking Cheap now
is the time to get the dehumidifier you
[SPEAKER_00]: need the air conditioner you need get that
room dialed in properly You're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing a product you want high
quality When I worked at guitar center,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used this to explain things to customers
You could buy a cheap ass guitar if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, but it's gonna hurt the kids
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna sound like shit It's never
going to be fun to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never gonna sound like Metallica on
that shit ass guitar Or you could step it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and not buy the lowest level you could
buy a guitar center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes good Better best you could buy
better you could buy the medium range
[SPEAKER_00]: guitar where it doesn't kill your fingers
every time you play And it's got potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to have good tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna fall apart It's not gonna
come out of tune every time you hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking strings get the better Don't get
the the shitty one the good one get the
[SPEAKER_00]: better one so that you actually enjoy
growing your your goal here is to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: a product but also Growing can be very
therapeutic for me being in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't answer the phone if I'm in the
grow room and anybody calls Maybe if the
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter calls because my daughter might
need something I'll answer for her anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else The girlfriend of the company the
banker the accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't answer for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I'm in the garden, dude That is my
Zen space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my area You can't fuck with me And
if I just cheap-ass it and used a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: half-ass piece of gear in there I wouldn't
have any pride in it and it wouldn't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: Zen when I was in there So put a lot of
pride into it and also understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a budget issue for a lot of people
but don't cheap out your And other things
[SPEAKER_00]: I betcha like maybe just don't buy that
PlayStation game or that Xbox game that I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking say that that's like me saying
don't buy that one pair of sneakers So
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can buy that air conditioner,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm buying the sneakers now because I
bought all the air conditioners already
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're running and the rooms are
working so I know things are where they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be and in turn the business is
working So since I put the money in
[SPEAKER_00]: there's money coming out I can buy the
sneakers now You got to put the money in
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the product out you want my point
is if you're gonna do this shit Have pride
[SPEAKER_00]: in it have 100% pride If you go in there
and you just half-ass it and the product
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out and you half-ass it when you
smoke it It will be a half-ass product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have half-ass pride in it Anything
that you grow and you smoke and you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume that you put pride into you're
gonna feel a better buzz more pride when
[SPEAKER_00]: you consume it So put pride in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this on a previous
episode a lot of you are growing allegedly
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe potentially possibly in an illegal
place if you're gonna do it fucking do it
[SPEAKER_00]: like don't go in there and just half-ass
it have pride In it felonies aren't free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't commit that crime to fucking just be
doing it commit that fucking felony tough
[SPEAKER_00]: When like if you're gonna go in buck and
go and dude, alright, I feel like I
[SPEAKER_00]: rambled for a long time I've got another
message here, but I think we should save
[SPEAKER_00]: this one because I've been going for a
long time and the throat is nice and dry
