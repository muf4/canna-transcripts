[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everyone, this is Dab and Granny,
and you're listening to the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 231 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am dabbed out this
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having a good day
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a giant dab of some Lemon
Jeffery, High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract with a little bit of High Tert
Full Spectrum Extract poured into the
[SPEAKER_00]: banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of changed my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you guys were here to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these days maybe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about a new toy I got you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up a thing called a thermal
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about a banger on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: A banger is basically, it attaches to a
rig, which is basically a small bubbler or
[SPEAKER_00]: a pipe or maybe even a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a smaller bubbler, like a
handheld sidecar size sort of bubbler
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google a Hitman hammerhead sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of my favorite rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're affordable and I like the style
and the function and the size and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I got the 14 mil male
attachment coming out here, the joint
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the banger attaches to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a 14 millimeter female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes up and it's got a 90 degree
turn on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on that it's got like a, it looks
like maybe an upside down thimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made out of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a thimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the inside of that is a
smaller thimble on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's maybe like a big, like a soda
bottle lid or a water bottle lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about that diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a little bit taller than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one and a half of those tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the inside is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another cylinder, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a cup with a cup inside of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bowl with a cup inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you heat the outside and you put the
dab on the inside one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put, so when I bought it,
they didn't have these caps available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it over at Elevate Glass on 517
South Bay Hone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I bought the thermal banger is what
it's called, they didn't have these bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought it and I took it home and I
tried to take a dab with the normal carb
[SPEAKER_00]: cap and it just wasn't doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set it aside like that kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time I went to higher elevators,
Elevations Masterpiece Productions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Elevate's sister store just
across town, they're like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: how'd you like your thermal banger?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, do you have a bubble cap
for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, sir, I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, let's get you a bubble
cap for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a bubble cap and let me
tell you, the bubble cap and the thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: banger make an amazing fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting extra high lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the dabs, I already take gigantic
dabs and it just makes the gigantic dab I
[SPEAKER_00]: take seem even gigantic-er, which I know
isn't even a word, but it is now when you
[SPEAKER_00]: dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take gigantic-er dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a bumper sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take gigantic-er dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs are good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's talk about what I'm smoking
on that's put me in this condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the Lemon Jeffrey high
cannabinoid and high turf full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got some of the Stardog
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just held it up to the microphone like
you guys would be able to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how high that shit made me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I've also got some screaming
tangerines, which smells, it just screams
[SPEAKER_00]: tangerines.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dab that, the whole room smells
like a tangerine for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got the Gorilla Glue we talked
about on a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back and bought more because I like
what it does to my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemony stuff is the medical cannabis
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me turn this music down so I can think
a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when I'm dabbing stuff that
has like citrus and lemons, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: more medical for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke this gassy flavored stuff,
that's recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a recreational high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I think if I take enough dabs of
any strain, it becomes recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still recreational use is medical use
because if it makes you feel better,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mental health, it's physical health,
it's all related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the Gorilla Glue gets me really
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some, oh, I've got some Stardog
Batter also.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have sitting here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more flavor than it gets me high,
but maybe that's because it's fixing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I'm not noticing,
but I really do enjoy the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what did I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sour Amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled really good in the jar and it
smells pretty good in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stirred it up and I've dabbed out of
it a lot, but the flavor, I'm smelling it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor just doesn't come through in a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping there would be more flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is okay, it's acceptable,
but that flavor just didn't come through
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was what I bought it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I've got a whole bunch of Tasty
Hatcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing a whole smorgasbord of
it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got some Lemon Jeffrey Terps and
I've got some of the Clementine Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dunked a little bit of the Clementine
Batter into the Clementine Terps and took
[SPEAKER_00]: a little dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That citrus flavor is always nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that if I overheat the
Clementine, if a Clementine dab gets too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, in my opinion, it tastes a little bit
like orange chicken or some sort of orange
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored Chinese food, which I know sounds
weird because I don't even eat chicken,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it tastes like some kind of Chinese
food is what it reminds me of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That orange syrupy thing, that sticky
orange syrup that comes on Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I certainly am crazy, but maybe that
opinion is crazy because I'm going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to throw it and we'll
keep talking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that keeps me going for a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's update you guys on a breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about a breeding project
quite frequently on the podcast and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: proud to say that those seeds have been
successfully harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a few great new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were just testers that will
probably be kept privately for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum Tangy to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much that'll get spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll probably stay right here in my
vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow those out, find the great ones,
and then maybe breed with or to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem-4 to Arise won't go too far,
but things I do plan on making for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: production run, I have to test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have to see if they're worth a
shit, but something I know they'll be good
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I'm a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow from my heart, breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that these are going to be well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Capelten to Arise, the Kalanji to
Arise, Flow to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are going to be bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that those will get released
because I like to make a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum Tangy was just kind of a
personal project for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum Tangy, the Chem-4,
a couple of those won't go anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Capelten, Flow, Kalanji Kush,
maybe even the Red-Headed Stranger to
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I got to test them all,
see if they're worth a shit before I let
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody even touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've tested a few, I'll give them out
to other people to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go through two or three rounds
of testing before they will ever even be
[SPEAKER_00]: given out as freebies or for sale
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of whole new great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Jeff's OG to Arise, Hell's OG to
Arise, Kalanji Kush, Kanadential,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem-4, Critical Mass, Platinum Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a whole bunch of cool stuff to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I did it this time,
I cut down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I defoliated it heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took almost all of the leaves off of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I bucked the buds off of the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just put all of the buds into
Tupperware dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're carefully labeled with what
plant they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all sitting in a little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just drying out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they dry, I will go and just
crumble them up into the little Tupperware
[SPEAKER_00]: dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in, and then you just basically
tip it to the side and all the seeds roll
[SPEAKER_00]: out and all the bud stays up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gather up all the seeds,
put them in a jar, label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go through in the future and
sort out all the bad looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those go to, they actually end up as
bird feed, or I just throw them away,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they end up as chicken feed mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into the mix with the chicken feed
just to make you go a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of them, but something's
got to happen with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just get thrown in with the
chicken feeder, with the bird feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my chickens are my birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get taken somewhere else for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else was I going to say about the
breeding project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding with multiple females
and one male in a room, timing is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk that I bred with,
yes, I did breed two lemon skunk to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more firefly seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also made more morning dew seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog to arise, there's more of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk to arise, there's plenty
more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I was going to say, the lemon
skunk is a really strong sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes longer than almost everything
else in that room to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really showed me that when I tried
to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have put that plant into flower a
week to 10 days before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else, and it would have made
more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made a very minimal amount of seeds
because I tried to time it with everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you is if you're going to
breed, in the future, I do have an email
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding and I'm going to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just overwhelmed with emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working my way through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do breed, think more about plants
that time up better because I put a 72 day
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in with 56 and 60 day plants and
tried to breed and it kind of fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't do anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, everything probably made like a
thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one made like 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that were in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I tell you guys that I was
breeding in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my plants in the breeding project
were in larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had some that I just wanted to make
a few for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about earlier, the Platinum
Tangy, the Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were in beer cups,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them on a table in a beer cup and I
flowered them all the way out in the beer
[SPEAKER_00]: cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred to them in a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made about 50 seeds each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a breeder, that's all I need for
myself to do plenty of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to breed,
don't be in intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in very small pots and make
50 to 100 seeds for yourself with no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't breed under anything smaller
than a 600 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to breed with the 400 and it
didn't make shit for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 600 did okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, a thousand is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to breed and make healthy
solid seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to do like a five by five
space of cups or three gallon pots or I
[SPEAKER_00]: like six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go big to do a breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing is the crucial part is what I
think I was trying to say when I got off
[SPEAKER_00]: on a rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the seed project has been
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my next order of business?
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a shout out to a couple of really
kind and generous people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if either of these guys want
me to say their names because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed on Patreon and I try to keep
it kind of private and not blast
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to John B and Steven P,
Patreon contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made very generous Patreon
contributions for a couple of months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys ever have questions or
anything like that, make sure you email
[SPEAKER_00]: them to me and let me know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me that you're John B and Steven P
from Patreon and I'll definitely get your
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to the top of the list and try
to help you guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate your generosity
and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows me that you guys trust me and
that you believe in me and that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: helping you out in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means more to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the contribution,
but if you're going to throw that at me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that you trust me and you
believe in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a guy putting out a podcast every week,
that makes it well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you about Patreon since I'm
thanking dudes for contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is also a service that allows you
as a listener to financially contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to beg for money,
but if you feel like this podcast was
[SPEAKER_00]: worth a couple of bucks, if you feel like
my time, my effort, my energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: my guidance, my support, my knowledge,
my help, my consultations were worth a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of bucks, you can go to patreon.com
slash grow from your heart and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you need will be right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up to become a Patreon
contributor and that will allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that would do for me, honestly,
I will use those funds to pay for the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a website, which is where I host
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost me a few bucks every year to
keep that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of storage that I pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 230 episodes of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that there are a hundred of
them are available in the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can learn how to make my website show
more, I'll put them all up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cannot learn how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My web guy doesn't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can figure out how to get all 231
available, they would be there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know how to make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't find that damn button to click yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's got to be there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'll do with your funds is maybe
I'll pay somebody who's better at web
[SPEAKER_00]: hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guy is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just busy, but I will pay for the
website with the funds that you send my
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, these little microphone covers,
I'm rubbing this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have guests on the show quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to replace these when Mike comes
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to make Mike use the same
microphone cover that maybe granny or
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay or Chris, whoever else has been on
the show in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to make them share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's kind of gets a little funky
if you have them on there for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell my own if I use it for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can smell my own, that means
other people can smell other people's even
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just gross to do that to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I swap out these microphone covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have to buy new memory cards from
my zoom H6 occasionally because it eats
[SPEAKER_00]: them for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basic stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging, but if you feel like you
want to contribute, that's what it would
[SPEAKER_00]: help me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's little things on their tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you donate, if you contribute a certain
amount, it puts you in line to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: questions answered first, email me or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, let me know that you did
that because Patreon isn't good at
[SPEAKER_00]: notifying me of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go check every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me an email and say, Hey dude,
I just contributed this much on Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would like my question answered and
I will get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put you right at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll print your email out and then I will
write on it, Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll make sure to give you a shout
out and I will also read your email
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would allow you as a listener to
financially contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will quit begging and we'll move
forward with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else has been going on in the world
of Rasta Jeff and I read genetics and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who do not know,
I am the lead cultivator for three rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dispensary in Pueblo called
three rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a medical side and a recreational
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in Colorado and you're a
medical marijuana patient, you can shop on
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not have your medical marijuana
recommendation from a doctor, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from out of state and you're 21 and
over, you are allowed to shop on the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that right, the medical
side and the recreational side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am currently running the grow for
the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are building a very large facility that
will host more medical and our
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational grow and I will be running
that grow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, we had a volunteer inspection,
a compliance inspection from the
[SPEAKER_00]: department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run or work in a large grow in
Colorado, any type of grow, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing tomatoes, if you're growing
lettuce, if you're growing, what do they
[SPEAKER_00]: have down there, cantaloupes or peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis right now is where they're
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing anything,
if you have a farm that's licensed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be visited and inspected by the
Colorado department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their goal and their main mission is to
make sure that you are not putting any
[SPEAKER_00]: humans or animals in danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you to kill animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you to kill people and
they don't want you to kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little nerve wracking when I was
told, hey, the department of agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming to inspect your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell you the truth, I got like,
oh, what is that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a compliance officer that
guides me through things that the grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: we got together and they make a checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The department of ag makes it very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a checklist that you can go
through and make sure that everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: order in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you what you are allowed and are
not allowed to have on premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you what you are and are not
allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you're following basic
safety rules, you're already doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been trained in worker protection
safety by the department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already knew what I needed to look
for and prepare for and what I needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: train my guys on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys, if you have a grow,
they will be at your, if you're running a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grow, they will be at your
cannabis grow eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have not been there, I recommend
that you call and you schedule a voluntary
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance check.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they come for a voluntary compliance
check, unless they see, I think the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: said he's looking for anything that would
cause immediate threat to human or animal
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they see anything that's a blatant
fuck up, unless you're doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid, if you call for a voluntary
compliance check, they are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: write you up or fine you for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have anything to be written up
for, but they were very happy with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, Hey, we want you guys to
call so that we can come out here and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you what to do because you don't know what
you're doing wrong until you're corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a facility, I would
recommend you call the Colorado department
[SPEAKER_00]: of agriculture and schedule a compliance
check, a voluntary compliance check.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could prevent the things like we
spoke about in a previous episode where
[SPEAKER_00]: people were not applying the proper
pesticides or not applying them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody would have came out there and
spoke with those folks, they could have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten it correct and they would not have
had as large of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you schedule them to come out there,
they'll come out there and look at your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they did, they looked at our pesticide
logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at our pesticide logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked for our MSDS logs,
which is the material safety data sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have every pesticide and
product that's in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have the material safety data
sheet available in a central location.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made sure we had eye wash stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They honestly didn't even check for fire
extinguishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had fire extinguishers in all the
proper places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not even check for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked us a lot of questions about our
pesticide application procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you wear when you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just basically wanted to make sure
that we were doing everything safely and
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Hey, you do that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you ever thought about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would encourage thought in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would make me think of a better,
safer, more practical way to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: things because I'm a smart dude,
but honestly, I'm going to miss some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to miss a few things and a
little bit of guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of education should be
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was grateful that this dude pointed a
couple of things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no violation or anything,
but he's like, did you ever think of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever think of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just gave us a few ideas on ways we
could improve safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really no reason for me to be
nervous or intimidated by a department of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very knowledgeable and he did not
want to write anybody up for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to make sure we were doing
things correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to leave us a list of things we
could improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we were talking, the dude was
just very knowledgeable and he seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: know a lot about pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew a lot about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just a very knowledgeable guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we spoke, he taught me a lot of
great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me a lot about respirators,
a lot about respirator use, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: required to have respirator training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was unaware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in some of the paperwork that
I've got, but it's in the updated
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, Hey, that's new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this many days to get that taken
care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll be back in 60 to 90 days to check
on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to tell you the truth, we've already
scheduled all of the respirator training,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything will have been handled very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're using a respirator,
make sure you're using the right
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges on the respirator and maybe
even go to a doctor and make sure your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs are properly equipped to wear that
respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe even get a fit test and
make sure you're wearing the respirator
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, because there are, if you're
not wearing it properly, there are leaks
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're just breathing in the pesticide
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make little, little air holes that
actually bring in more than you would if
[SPEAKER_00]: you just opened it freely, because you
create a little suction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The department of agriculture was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no reason to be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a facility, I recommend
that you call and volunteer for a
[SPEAKER_00]: voluntary compliance check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, if you are screwing up,
they'll come tell you, Hey, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: screwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't show up surprisingly and be
like, Hey, look, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this and this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you have to keep your
pesticides away from all your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have all your equipment
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have your safety equipment
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have all of your
paperwork, your spray logs, your MSDS
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets, and all of your department of
agriculture posters, that racist poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have that accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you need eye wash stations and
they're going to ask you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about what happens if your
worker sprays pesticides in his eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's this going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to drive into the hospital?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the hospital?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does he notify if something happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for those types of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I'm a smart dude and we're
kind of prepared and I have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I answered all of those questions
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they pull aside all of the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that applies pesticides or any
sort of sprays using the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application device, they ask them a lot of
questions also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also inspected all of the
pesticide applicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a paint sprayer and then we've
got some smaller things that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inspected all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask us how we clean them,
how often we clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically make sure you're doing shit
right and everything will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't schedule the voluntary
inspection, they can just show up and
[SPEAKER_00]: inspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you fuck up, they can fine
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically they're making sure you're
not causing any immediate threat to human
[SPEAKER_00]: health or safety is their main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my new friend at the
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great learning a lot from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt you listen to the podcast,
but if you do, big thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great day with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I need to press
pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not even press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take a dab together and then
we're going to get into some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that this works out because I got
to get my shit in a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this email right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to set myself up for success,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dab some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want to get into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fuck me up too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dab out of the one I've already
opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a freshie right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one I've been dipping into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a good buzz, but it doesn't
fuck me up to where I can't function and
[SPEAKER_00]: can't think about a podcast where I get
all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get quiet when I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I ramble when I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of depends on what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently right now I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a decent sized dab of some
clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine batter on my pencil dabber
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my Hitman Hammerhead Sidecar with
the yellow label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the hammerhead perk on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's why I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hits well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the flared out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are haters on Hitman
glass, but it hits well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course I have got the dual
layered thermal banger here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heating the shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also got my bubble cap within
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you were at home,
if you're wherever you are, if you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: this place where you could take a dab,
take a fat dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if your mom's around,
certainly give her a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm heating this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a couple of seconds
because it's a thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to go kind of low temp on
this dab, not take too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me for a dab,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me, send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're dabbing while
you're dabbing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's plenty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my coil condenser decorated torch
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass
for keeping me laced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This torch was a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a gift from the beautiful Miss
Jenny B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out for the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to let this nail
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the thing about a dabber,
a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to let it cool and get it
just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to talk my way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to let it get cool because if I hit it
too hard, it will make me cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is just about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have let it cool just a little too
much, but it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the cap on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that thermal banger and the bubble
cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got hash oil all over the
email paper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hash oil on my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get back into a podcast,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tolerating a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you took a fat dab of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're talking funny too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your head is vibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm going to cough,
but I'm not going to let myself because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from one of my favorite
emailers, one of my favorite listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy communicates with me quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is Mr. St. Skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a long email, but it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, sorry it's taken me so long to
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having a rough time keeping up
with everyday lately, but things are
[SPEAKER_00]: settling down for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the call the other day from one of
the nurses and they have good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mama St's new immune system is 100%
engrafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although going a little crazy being stuck
in the house all the time, but overall
[SPEAKER_00]: things are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that cough I said I wasn't going
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I didn't mean to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to St. Skinny's mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be fine in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself some Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, I want to thank you for the shout
out and love sent to Ma St and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually on the way home from the
cancer center, which happens to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same hospital that we were coming home
from when you did the first shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was definitely needed that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process has been rough on both of us,
but especially Mama St. Dude, I'm glad I
[SPEAKER_00]: could give you a shout out at just the
right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of life happens just
as it's supposed to that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To continue with the email, it says,
you asked me about the name St. Skinny and
[SPEAKER_00]: how I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the answer you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been slender since I started high
school and high school was a point that I
[SPEAKER_00]: basically only owned black shirts and
black or blue jeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we were playing hacky sack and my
buddy midget decided to give me the name
[SPEAKER_00]: Skinny Black, which I didn't know was a
character in hustle and flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given the name because he's Skinny
and I always wore black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost immediately it changed to just
Skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years later, I was listening
to a song called St. Jimmy and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: replace Jimmy with Skinny whenever it came
up in the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put St. Skinny as my middle name in
Facebook as a joke, and it just stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well with you and yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a great asset to the community and
doing a great job breaking the stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Skinny, it's good to know more about
my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I know that about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that dab is fucking my brain up
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, man, thanks for noticing that I
have broken the stoner stereotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not accurate right now because
I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even talk right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, I do break that
stoner stereotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak well, try to be on time for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing I'm an asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great for you to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it all worth the work that I put
into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuckin awesome that she's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her immune system will boost back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be doing good again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, thanks for all the info about
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like knowing stuff about my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they call me Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess would be fair because I've got
dreadlocks down to my ass and I listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae and I'm a Rasta man and my name is
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rasta Jeff was just an easy nickname
for me to acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends call me Wookie because
I'm 6'5 and I have dreadlocks and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a Chewbacca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer not to wear shoes too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I could use a shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they call me Wookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then back in the day, my friends used
to call me Hippie because I was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: great baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a place and one of the old
guys asked my best friend, why do you call
[SPEAKER_00]: him Hippie?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy's response was because it's
better than calling him a pussy in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I laughed pretty good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my buddy, Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Skinny, thanks for the email,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever have any more questions or
anything else to say, I hope you contact
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I miss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, shout out to all my friends at the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what the Dude Grows crew
is, Dude Grows is another podcast about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different style than my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty Real and the Dudes sit around and
talk about recharge all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might enjoy the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen when I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't listen constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to so many podcasts, but I do
listen to the Dude Grows show and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely will be at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they throw another event, I will go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may even compete because last time one
of my strains won second place and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at second or third.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a tie for it became, I don't
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at the second or third place,
but one of my strains, Lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: won an award and I didn't even grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine that if I grew it and I
entered it, it would fucking win,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skinny, thanks for the messages,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope mom is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab right now and give mama
Saint or mama Skinny a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure she hears this, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure she hears this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well, mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one starts off and specifically says,
please don't use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call me part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlamagne, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that being said, let's get down
to the brass tacks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken, biochar is
carbon-based material that is burned
[SPEAKER_00]: without air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at the wood chips,
the wood, oh, and wood pellets from my
[SPEAKER_00]: electric smoker and noticed that they were
burned, but not ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good to use as an amendment to
cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be used in a tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine it would be great for
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that wood ash contains a lot of
potassium, but goodies can be gained from
[SPEAKER_00]: this by-product or but can goodies be
gained from this by-product of carnivorous
[SPEAKER_00]: indulgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business out of the way, onto the
pleasantries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say that I was made aware
of your podcast from the Dude Gross Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shows become one of my favorite
podcasts and I never miss an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Throwback Thursday episodes and
the fact that they are super long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to put out long episodes
like two or three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans will listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, what the fuck do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it sounds like you know a lot so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've asked a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sparked some thought in my mind and
other people's minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've given me a compliment and you've
mentioned the Dude Gross Show and told me
[SPEAKER_00]: where you came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, it sounds like you know a fucking
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with everything you've said so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the biochar part
here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thanks for mentioning the
Throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep putting those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get caught up eventually and
that's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what the hell am I going to do on
Thursdays?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to keep going with the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, thanks for the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the consistency with your
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that is the most challenging part,
the consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise to put out an episode every
Monday and I've been trying to do every
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday and I haven't missed one for like
six months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never missed a Monday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome for the consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the challenge of a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on and he says, I really look
forward to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I know you're already going to
take a fat dab, go ahead and give your mom
[SPEAKER_00]: a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like the ending to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, in the words of Joey Diaz,
stay black, cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's the best fucking ending to an
email ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerely, and then he says his name and
then he ends it with, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say parliament because that's what he said
to call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parliament, thanks for the email,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the good question because biochar,
I never thought too much about biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of them using biochar a lot at
the worm factory, but I have not thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about too much of it as in a cocoa
amendment until you sparked that thought
[SPEAKER_00]: in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about biochar for just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you said is that biochar is
one of the main things was that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: made without oxygen and you were doing
that, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how are you removing the oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a vacuum there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an absence of oxygen or is there
just free flowing oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there passive oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doubting you or your idea that
there is an oxygen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering, is there oxygen
flowing through there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, also, one of the things that
identifies it as biochar is the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says temperatures of four to 500
degrees produce more char while
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures above 700 favor the yield of
liquid and gas components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be pulling out more liquids and
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gases at higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of depends on what temperature
you're getting it to and how much char is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also biochar is really fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to make the biochar out
of that stuff, I would almost start the
[SPEAKER_00]: char once and then shred it up real fine
or break it up even smaller, make the
[SPEAKER_00]: pellets even smaller, and then rechar
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you can crush them up or break
them in half or something, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar, the smaller it is, the more
surface can get charred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more surface area that is
burned and it's got the carbon available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making the carbon available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that dusty part, the part that kind
of sticks to your fingers and makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers all black and you end up looking
like a coal miner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part that you're kind of
looking for, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make as much surface area
as you can to char as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will work better as an
amendment if it is smaller and more
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I think about the biochar is
they feed it to worms and the worms pass
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it makes it smaller and more
bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worms also love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think make it smaller, burn it again,
and then feed it to earthworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: red wigglers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think you're basically making
biochar, but you're close already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're mostly correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just getting my information from
the internet and you're really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are making low budget biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're off to a good start, but there are
a couple more things that sounds like you
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice would be, like I said,
char it, crush it again, char it again to
[SPEAKER_00]: where all of it is charred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that every, and I haven't used
your pellet stove, so I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: burned it's getting on the inside or on
the outside of the pellets, but make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all charred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's really fine and then use
some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe if you have the
availability, feed some of that to some
[SPEAKER_00]: red wiggler worms and then use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see if you see a difference in
the one, the plant without the biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant with the homemade biochar and
then the plant with the biochar fed to
[SPEAKER_00]: worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see differences, take notes,
that's the way that you really would know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you did it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's biochar, it sounds very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does sound like you're close and
it's probably going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to add that carbon to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're under the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the compliment about the
Throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the Joey Diaz quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets me know that you really have
learned who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the email, bro.

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget about Patreon,
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been posting videos to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you hear this, I think about
70 to 75 videos will be posted to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to listen to the long
episodes or if you're not able to listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to those, you can go to YouTube,
search for the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 20 episodes are on the old
iGrowCulture feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know about iGrowCulture,
the show was originally called
[SPEAKER_00]: iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of forced to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was already somebody else's business
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work with colleges and they make
college level horticultural materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to step on anybody's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I changed my name to the grow from your
heart podcast, which is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate because I grow from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this stuff is on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode one through 20 is on the
iGrowCulture YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 through 70 to 75 by now is available on
the grow from your heart podcast YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more videos made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got to post them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get them up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get all of them up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I'm recording episode 231.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to get 231 videos up onto the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will all be there for everyone to
watch and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's just a picture of myself
scrolling across the screen the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but it's for people that can't
listen through YouTube or through iTunes
[SPEAKER_00]: or Stitcher or however else you listen to
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people to check out the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling for about 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to wrap up the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's doing that thing where it
starts cutting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in a conversation with a doctor
who said that strains don't matter when it
[SPEAKER_00]: came to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she definitely did her job of standing
up for specific strains and strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she stood up for breeders and she made
me proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she actually mentioned me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe you a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for standing up for the breeders,
standing up for strains and silly strain
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically for standing up for me
and for cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bo, you're a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have you on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
