[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a new grower or a professional
grower, if you're a new smoker or a
[SPEAKER_09]: veteran dabber, if you're on probation and
you can't smoke, if you're a cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: activist or someone who's just curious
about the current state of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to send a huge thank you shout out
to the Mystic Roots band for letting me
[SPEAKER_09]: use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: A big huge thanks to Kat and Coot and the
entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for letting me play the music.
[SPEAKER_09]: The song you're hearing right now is
called The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So sitting at the table with me is our new
guest, Mr. Paul Rosales.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, my friend?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I say your whole name or is that
not a good thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought about it right after I said it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And across the table from me is a
returning guest.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got Clint Stewart with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to turn down that music so we
can talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so high, my voice got higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's high except me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, can we talk about why you're not
high?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, go for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul happens to be on probation because he
was a bad little boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got himself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't talk about what he did because I
don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I killed a man just to watch him die.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard there's a song somebody wrote
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Jim Cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim Cash, is that who it was?
[SPEAKER_08]: Never heard of him.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Jim Carrey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim Carrey wrote a song.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we go down this road, I want to
warn everybody listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: These men are comedians and this could be
a funny episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know what's going to come out of
these boys' mouths.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've listened to previous episodes
with Clint, they've already got funny shit
[SPEAKER_09]: to say because I see them already holding
back jokes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've listened to any previous
episodes with Clint, Clint is a jokester.
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be a very entertaining episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make sure of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clint will make sure of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul will make sure of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we're talking that you guys are
comedians, let's just drop a plug right
[SPEAKER_09]: away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can the kind folks of Pueblo or
Colorado see you?
[SPEAKER_09]: This will come out like the second week of
April.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to have to plan your plugs
in advance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can see us every Thursday at the
Rainbow for the Wild Cousins Comedy Open
[SPEAKER_07]: Mic down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in Pueblo on Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then April 7th, we have a show also at
the Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_07]: For $5, you can see Mary Mack,
who has been on a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been on Last Comic Standing and a
bunch of different comedy festivals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently she did a voice on Aquatine
Hunger Force.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was she on Aquatine?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was she Carl?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that time they had Rush on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: She played Geddy Lee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's April 7th.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's coming with her husband,
who has been on Letterman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm spacing the name right now,
but you should just come check it out and
[SPEAKER_07]: come check us out every Thursday at the
Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This will come out the day before that,
I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this will come out the 6th.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at my phone right now,
trying to find the calendar.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, the 7th.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys go tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're listening to this on the 6th,
go to the Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a friend who thought that was in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They drove to Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They looked for the Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they realized that it's in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they drove back home.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time they got there,
I think they missed your show.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of that happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really nice room too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comedians get free pizza and a free drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what qualifies me as a comedian?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I get up and tell a joke?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get up there and tell a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get some pizza.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come do open mic night at the Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a free beer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a free beer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have my free beer if I go get one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because I don't need the beer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, now you're drinking again,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: What?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two men in the room that three men in the
room that don't drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alcohol does not agree with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm allergic to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: I break out in handcuffs and fat chicks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just get, I get really angry and I say
stuff that I don't mean, but I do that
[SPEAKER_07]: sober.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that's how it just like
multiplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives it another level.
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes it all out.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we go too far, I should do the
commercials because we're going to get
[SPEAKER_09]: into this conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge, huge shout out to Bern and Jesse and
the entire crew.

watt Hortilux bulb.

[SPEAKER_07]: That was my nickname in college,
was African night crawler.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never went to college.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I was just going to
let that fly and I wanted to make that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that one time we were flyering out
of college.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes you the red wiggler,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a wrestler name.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like my dog on his back.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a red rocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little different.
[SPEAKER_09]: That wiggles.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm skipping this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: This red rocket has been brought to you by

[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, these guys are nodding their heads
like, yeah, we know what all this organic
[SPEAKER_09]: soil shit means.
[SPEAKER_09]: We sure do not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like Bukaki.
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of grabbed my attention right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.

[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough ads.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've just got fun and games ahead of us
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your comedians, tell me a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you hate that shit?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people do that to you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Your comedian make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's silly because I still consider myself
an open micer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Comedian is something I aspire to be,
but...
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're a comedian?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not getting paid for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still a steel worker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll consider myself a comedian or
consider the years I've been a comedian as
[SPEAKER_07]: many times as I claim it on my taxes and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Respectable.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you actually start getting booked for
gigs and stuff like that, we're just local
[SPEAKER_08]: feature guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've got a lot of hearts,
dude, and that's what takes a lot of... A
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of it is a lot of hearts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what you need.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of guys are... They just don't have
the heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to go up there and repeat the
same shit every week.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can tell they're just doing it to
just do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys got the heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're bringing it to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do it because it's a way for me to
get all the negative shit I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_07]: about myself out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I can make people laugh from it,
then it kind of validates all the shitty
[SPEAKER_07]: things that I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Paul's real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's kind of a self-righteous way
to look at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not doing it for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way Paul does his comedy is
self-deprecating.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might sound like, oh, he's doing it for
himself, and it is, but it's also like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to tell you this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a healthy way to get shit out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's way cheaper than a therapist.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're making me laugh,
we're both getting therapy out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of the guys will... We're always
trying new stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only a few guys that have fallen
into a trap of not doing new stuff fairly
[SPEAKER_08]: regularly, but it's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, to see when a joke can fail too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see what he wanted to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, damn, dude, if you'd have
twisted this, that joke would have worked.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's neat seeing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get to see the initial and like,
why didn't that work?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you talk about it and,
oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get to see it the next time he
does it and he's got a little bit more
[SPEAKER_08]: confidence because he's done it once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Open mic comedy is so fun to watch as an
art form, not just the comedy that you're
[SPEAKER_08]: watching, but the comedy is like the
reason you're putting butts in seats.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for us to watch guys evolve and get
better and like, perfect case in point was
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan Rainey.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard a lot about Dan Rainey.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was really not good when he started,
but he went from not good and he was okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: but now he's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it came fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: It went a lot easier for him to go from
not good to like good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think confidence had a lot to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: His material, I thought was always funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just when he told it, he was kind of
unsure about it and you can't really be.
[SPEAKER_09]: It took a lot to get him started,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to get him up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just to get him on stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he'd been coming to comedy shows
since like six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: I first started doing comedy and he was
just so scared to get up on stage and tell
[SPEAKER_07]: a joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he finally did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some people, once you do it,
that just opens up the four gates.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: As I was a teenager, I've watched comedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell from talking to me and I've
been into comedy as long as you guys have.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've been in that club and I would
love to walk up on stage and throw down
[SPEAKER_09]: one good set.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm obviously okay with talking in a
group.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do grow meetings where I just run my
mouth and talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I just thinking about going up there
to do a set.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to shit my pants.
[SPEAKER_09]: It scares the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't say I can't do it, but I know that
that's not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just weird for me to even think about
getting up there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the party or whatever, I'll tell
everybody a joke all day long.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get up there and you really feel
like you have something to say and you
[SPEAKER_07]: want to tell these people something and
they don't laugh at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so heartbreaking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's soul crushing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the thing that I like watching
in other guys and in myself is you watch
[SPEAKER_08]: these guys like I was trying to get to
with Dan is like he evolved and you could
[SPEAKER_08]: see that evolution every step and it was
neat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, there's guys
that don't want to come out to shows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they tell the same jokes or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's like, no, like, look at the new
thing that he did to the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know that we're probably getting
pretty deep on like, I know it's like
[SPEAKER_09]: writing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like getting tailoring that that
joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's why I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not something it's like making a
recipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time you make that recipe,
it was too spicy, but you knew what you're
[SPEAKER_09]: aiming for.
[SPEAKER_09]: He took out a little spice, added more
garlic.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like watching.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've seen you do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've watched your joke telling evolve,
not just your jokes get better,
[SPEAKER_09]: but your approach to telling a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to get naked to have a
punchline anymore because your jokes have
[SPEAKER_09]: some body to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep your clothes on.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one of the best bits I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, thanks buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do that joke for everybody
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it because it's a visual bit and it
works wonderfully on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how that's going to fail as a
joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for Dan Rady's Twitter feed so
that we can get him some.
[SPEAKER_08]: At Dan Champion.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look for at Dan Champion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just follow him randomly.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have no idea why you got a bump on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a really funny guy coming out of the
Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few funny people coming out of
the Springs, but I think he's one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: funnier ones.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's really working at it and it's
neat to see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like having a second job when you're
not getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're not getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm a musician and I've gone and
played free shows.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that feeling of just locking in
with the bass player and getting the song
[SPEAKER_09]: right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was worth my setup time, my couple
hours on stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: To drive to wherever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And go do 15 minutes is really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes five.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll drive up to go do five.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll do 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll do 15 just because they're like,
oh, you drove from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have 15 minutes now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can get about 15 with all of my
material, but I don't use a lot of old
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you exploiting your jail experience
for material?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would definitely have some material.
[SPEAKER_07]: A jail material and a recent break.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should write a joke about these two
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not get raped and I'm offended.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I did get raped, first of all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my comedy is very personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be 100% honest with my writing
and my comedy because I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_07]: the only way that I can really find my own
voice because I'm still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what I'm exactly doing
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just write from where I feel correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: See, now I'm still confused if you did or
did not get raped because you're a
[SPEAKER_09]: comedian and it's awkward over here a
little.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quit winking, Gavin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you say I didn't get raped?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is weird now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quit touching my leg while you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot of rape in PCJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have a friend who was in there who
was apparently someone's bitch and that
[SPEAKER_07]: made me feel a little weird just to see
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, we were going to talk about weed in
this show too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just going to be prison sex the
whole talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: There wasn't any sex or anything,
but he would give them foot rubs and clean
[SPEAKER_07]: his clothes and they would share
commissary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was his bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: These weird family roles that are assigned
to you when you're in jail for a
[SPEAKER_07]: considerable amount of time, and I was
only in there for 16 days, but I still got
[SPEAKER_07]: assigned a certain role.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for a thug like you, I bet that 16
days is just rough.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a bitch like me, that 16 days was the
worst 16 days of my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag man boobs.
[SPEAKER_08]: By day six, he was the adabisi of... So
you're about to tell me what your role
[SPEAKER_09]: was.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_07]: My role was story time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would tell stories at night so people
can go to sleep because they couldn't
[SPEAKER_07]: sleep after a while without hearing some
kind of story.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you didn't get raped and when you talk,
everyone falls asleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody liked you in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, people loved me in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had kosher trays that I would trade for
paper because I didn't have any money on
[SPEAKER_07]: my books or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I found out Nazis will fucking give me
their teenage daughters for some Jew
[SPEAKER_07]: peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got fresh fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I need if I'm in jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's definitely what I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I only did 15 days and that was almost 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any jail stories.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, either do I.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm proud of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's behave ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: No more jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's why I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now that cannabis is legal in
Colorado, I don't do anything that would
[SPEAKER_09]: even make me worth being in trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the only thing I ever did was
smoke too much weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't just dab out all day.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one can worry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wussies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wussies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or my advice, since Colorado is getting
full and it's getting expensive to rent a
[SPEAKER_09]: house here, make cannabis legal where you
are.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do that there too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to come.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're hot and you wear yoga pants,
come here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're just coming here just to
grow some weed, just do it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're easy and you don't mind a fat
chubby guy on top of you, definitely come
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a sales pitch you cannot argue with
right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fat chubby, I'll get on top of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll smother you all night long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't get on top of you if you're really
scared.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get on top of me and it's like a
fun air mattress with a penis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the little blow up nub on the
air mattress.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to read a news article because
Clint actually told me that he had a
[SPEAKER_09]: question for me and I'm going to my text
message to try to remember what that
[SPEAKER_09]: question was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also about using cannabis as a
sacrament.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked a little bit about Jamaica
legalizing cannabis for medical use on a
[SPEAKER_09]: past episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was either the last one or the one
before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also have made it, it used to be,
if you recall, with any cannabis in
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica, it would be a seven day sentence
in a Jamaican jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's nothing like the little luxury
condo that you just spent some time in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be- Have you been to Pueblo
County Jail?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I've heard some good stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the, everyone in their trades,
stories of like where to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you got to go to Crowley
County.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have carpet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like apparently Pueblo County Jail is
the worst facility in the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would believe that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then the Jamaican jail is,
it's still going to be worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: But so, and now in Jamaica, if you get
caught with cannabis, it's just a fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't go to jail right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a $200 fine if you have less
than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now guys like us can go, and also
they've made it to where if you have a
[SPEAKER_09]: medical marijuana card in the States,
you can go there and register your medical
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana card for a small fee and get a
pass to buy medical marijuana while you
[SPEAKER_09]: were in Jamaica from their stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard their weed sucks though.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to now because a lot of
people from the United States saw this
[SPEAKER_09]: coming, that cannabis was going to be
legalized.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have friends in the industry that
have already flown down there and set up
[SPEAKER_09]: shops and testing labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And BC bubble man was down there teaching
everybody how to make good hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going on down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of, kind of what I can tell
you about Jamaica without talking too much
[SPEAKER_09]: about what we said on another episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then you asked me, ironically,
you said, how about using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_09]: sacrament?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then today I look at the cannabis and
there it's the news page.
[SPEAKER_09]: I check out the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their headline is new in Indiana,
a cannabis church gets its chance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's where I got that idea for
that question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was because Indiana passed that law that
allows people to discriminate against
[SPEAKER_08]: gays.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like now, like as a part of religion,
is it okay to smoke weed there?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has to be because they can't tell
you what to do by that law.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't read the law.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to uphold one,
you got to uphold the other.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll read the whole article here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The sub headline says, if someone is
smoking in our church, God bless them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Church founder, Bill Levin says,
this is a church to show a proper way of
[SPEAKER_09]: life, a loving way of life.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all called cannitarians.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I feel about the word
cannitarians.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll wear Reeboks and drink the punch.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have something cannabis related
to add to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of Jews smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of them, especially now with
like the younger, like more alternative
[SPEAKER_07]: Hasidic groups that are coming up,
like in New York, like the Nonox and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything like that, they use it as a
sort of way to go back to their cultural
[SPEAKER_07]: roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: The holy anointing oil had a cannabis in
it, which is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had so much in it that it would
have psychoactive effects in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in other cases, they think that when
the high priest would go into a tent to
[SPEAKER_07]: speak to God, they would use things like
cannabis, some different other herbs and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff and incense and olive oil and the
THC oil and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would just basically hotbox
themselves as a way to speak to God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Paul's Jewish by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a book about it called Cannabis
Hasidim that if anyone's interested,
[SPEAKER_07]: they should definitely check out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check that one out for sure myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will read that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of religions use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think not just the Rastafarians use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's something, even if you're not
from part of the world where cannabis was,
[SPEAKER_09]: there is something very similar where you
were.
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually cannabis seems to have made
its way all the way around the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody was smoking cannabis,
all of the religions.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Saudis have smoked it and the Saudis
get overlooked a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm going to read this article.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally agree with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to read the article.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the article is by Sarah Pulliam Bailey
from the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says the First Church of Cannabis
Incorporated has been approved by
[SPEAKER_09]: Indiana's Secretary of State after the
state's religious freedom legislation
[SPEAKER_09]: became law last week.
[SPEAKER_09]: The church's founder, Bill Levin,
said he filed paperwork in a direct
[SPEAKER_09]: response to Indiana Governor Mike Pence's
signing the Religious Freedom Restoration
[SPEAKER_09]: Act into law last Thursday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Secretary of State Connie Lawson approved
the church as a religious corporation with
[SPEAKER_09]: all the stated intent to start a church
based on love and understanding with
[SPEAKER_09]: compassion for all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis is listed as the church's
sacrament in its doctrine, Levin said,
[SPEAKER_09]: and he will set up a church hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_09]: The church will plan to grow hemp,
he said, though they will not buy or sell
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone is smoking in our church,
God bless them, Levin said.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a church to show a proper way of
life, a loving way of life.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're called cannitarians.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they kind of linked that word
from the Rastafarians a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unitarians, maybe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unitarians, any kind of Aryans,
huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Big fan of the Aryans.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sure you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a senior swastika tattoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two.
[SPEAKER_09]: It matches your Hitler mustache very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: One on each ball.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something we're doing here in
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there those sects up?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually Green Faith Ministries,
which is a cannabis-related church.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here in Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in Denver.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're in Greeley.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're in Greeley.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a group in Springs when my old
band, Stem Beach Soul Revival,
[SPEAKER_07]: check them out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're still doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We played a dab party at a hookah bar in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a guy who was out there
handing out sacramental joints and stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually took about an ounce of hash and
dabbed everybody out all night that night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a fun night.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first time I ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it the last time?
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't the last time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dabbed a few times on here, but that was
a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: One time I got him so high, he had to get
up and leave.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then John Bueno turned as wide as the
walls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it John Bueno?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think John Bueno took a dab and
turned as wide as the walls.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, John Bueno wouldn't have taken a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think he'd taken a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Luke Cowie.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Previn.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Previn.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been so many people at this table
that we've dabbed out that have just
[SPEAKER_09]: turned pale.
[SPEAKER_09]: Calling people out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I feel about dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dabs do, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jabs look like drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you break out a blowtorch and you
start heating that shit up, I'm sure it
[SPEAKER_09]: does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like drugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, when you're dabbing somewhere,
just remember that, that you're using a
[SPEAKER_09]: torch and it looks like we're heating up
some crack.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seriously does.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if people are discriminating against
you for doing dabs, I am too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it looks like drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are ruining weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too much for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's supposedly cleaner than
smoking the actual glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's less crap that you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're smoking the more like pure form of
it and all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And butane.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just fucks me up so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, don't they do it like a different
method now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no butane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The method you're probably talking about
is Rosentec where we're just using a
[SPEAKER_09]: pressing comb, like a straightening iron,
squeezing the juice out of the blood by
[SPEAKER_09]: that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the BHO, the butane, there's no
butane left in our product.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting it clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: We figured out how to clean it out real
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smoke cigarettes, so I don't really care
about butane or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put horrible things into my body.
Yummy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a shout out to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys ever smoked those
before, but give them a try.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to talk about that on a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were three guys in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took like a half gram dab and didn't
choke.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other two guys are cigarette
smokers and they took little tiny dabs and
[SPEAKER_09]: had to get up and leave so they could go
hock loogies and die for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to take fat dabs,
if you want to do big hikes, if you want
[SPEAKER_09]: to go high in elevation, if you want to
live long, don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to be a productive,
good human being, don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not one of those people though.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're nasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if you don't want to get old,
smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really, I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want you to get old either.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Old, saggy tits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm losing, I lost 38 pounds since I
went into jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm losing these man tits, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies, less fat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still all the funny, half the fat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Still fat, but less this time,
which is really like, I wish all my
[SPEAKER_07]: ex-girlfriends would come back because I
think this is like the least amount I've
[SPEAKER_07]: weighed in my whole life.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like Paul has a few things he
needs to get off his chest.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my entire spectrum of
ex-girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give them a chance to come fuck
me again now that I'm better looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if any of you out there ever hear this
and you want to come back, I'm more
[SPEAKER_07]: active.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more attractive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's really, you know,
up to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's kind of thug now because he spent
some time in the slam.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little thug.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a lot of friends in there who want
me to do nefarious things for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they can't wait to get out and get
back into trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: His eyebrows say thug life.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got a 13 tattooed on the inside of
his lip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks good with your teardrop tattoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a lot of fucked up stories from
Mexican cartel guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this one kid that I was in there
with, he's not a kid, he's like 25,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he apparently fucked two chickens to
death when he was like 13.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to keep reading this
article.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, marijuana is currently illegal in
Indiana for both medical and recreational
[SPEAKER_09]: use.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the church could test the application
of the new law.
[SPEAKER_09]: RFRA prevents Indiana's government from
substantially burgeoning a person's
[SPEAKER_09]: exercise of religion if it can demonstrate
that it is at least the... Let me try that
[SPEAKER_09]: again because I'm still fucked up from
what Paul just said.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it can demonstrate that it is the least
restrictive means of furthering a
[SPEAKER_09]: compelling governmental interest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the best segue.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we asked him why he did it,
he just said, because it's Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mexico, you have some explaining to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he behead the chickens when he was
done?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, if they ate them or what?
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, that egg came out of that
hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: That egg is about that size.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look what I could do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like a waste of chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was all hungry when he was done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he eat it afterwards?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we asked, but he said,
no, that was gross.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's gross about that story.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's an interesting character.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Levin who spoke to the post by phone
said the church... Yeah, this is from
[SPEAKER_09]: Indiana.
[SPEAKER_09]: This part, Paul's part is from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_09]: Levin who spoke to the post by phone said
the church has received $2,000 in
[SPEAKER_09]: donations and received more than $7,000 or
7,000 Facebook fans in the five days that
[SPEAKER_09]: it has existed.
[SPEAKER_09]: He hopes to build the first church or
temple built of hempcrete, a building
[SPEAKER_09]: material similar to concrete that includes
hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard a lot about hempcrete and I
think it's amazing that we need to start
[SPEAKER_07]: using this more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and industrial hemp is a good idea,
especially since we can now grow hemp in
[SPEAKER_09]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just taking rocks out and creating,
putting hemp in instead of concrete?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't know how they make
concrete, so I don't want to sound stupid
[SPEAKER_09]: and try to act like I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's exactly how they do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they're using some kind of
cannabinoid as like the powdery agent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's apparently like extremely fire
resistant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So your houses won't burn down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it does, it'll smell real good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll smell really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how we're two capable white men and
we don't know how to make concrete.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we should know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a steel worker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little mad about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, yeah, like Rostafarian,
all right, he might not know how to make
[SPEAKER_08]: concrete.
[SPEAKER_08]: That guy that makes rebar, probably should
know how to make concrete.
[SPEAKER_07]: That just seems like a hobby of yours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'll make concrete on the side,
just fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whipping up a batch of Crete.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Waiting for Adam Carolla to come over so
we can hang some drywall.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're looking at those choices.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam Carolla, fix your fucking eyebrows,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think he has tattooed under
there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just grew them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is his love line.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I like that the thick eyebrows
is in with girls today because I love
[SPEAKER_07]: thick eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated the really thin cholo eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pencil them in real good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's not an attractive look.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, by the prettiness of the girls
I'm looking at, like the eyebrows is not
[SPEAKER_08]: what I'm concentrating on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's not what you're
concentrating on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like a nice face.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she doesn't have a mustache,
Clint's excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you shaved your arms?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm okay with a mustache as long as it,
you know, I can grow a better one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read some more of this
article.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're progressing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't ever stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to get through this one
article through the whole 45 minute show
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll be happy with life.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're progressing to get a building
property to be our holy ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, we're going to set up counseling
for heroin service and we have a huge
[SPEAKER_09]: epidemic in this country.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably have alcoholics anonymous
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to allow alcohol on the
premise.
[SPEAKER_09]: Levin also wrote out the new DD Dozen,
Ten Commandments, like a, Ten Commandments
[SPEAKER_09]: like list with suggestions for better
living.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm laughing at this article and
you guys while I'm trying to read.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bibles of other religions are
yesteryear about the drinking out of goat
[SPEAKER_09]: skins.
[SPEAKER_09]: What?
[SPEAKER_09]: About drinking out of goat skins.
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't relate to the people with GPS
in their hand and 7,000 tunes in that same
[SPEAKER_09]: hand, he said.
[SPEAKER_09]: The church is very simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first good book we're going to ask
petitioners to read and understand is The
[SPEAKER_09]: Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it kind of feels to me like this guy
is copying that church on weeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that church on weeds?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't watch weeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched the TV show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good TV show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, remember that up until Nancy got
shot and then I was like, who's spoiler
[SPEAKER_09]: alert?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to spoil the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last episode of weeds definitely made
me tear up though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a really good season finale or
series finale.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that part.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: More article.
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, I'm very faith driven.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very spiritual and I'm filled with
love.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said,
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, under RFRA, the state has to
articulate a compelling interest in
[SPEAKER_09]: preventing you from smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I argue they can't.
[SPEAKER_09]: The church of cannabis is just one test in
many under Indiana's new law, which has
[SPEAKER_09]: escalated a national prominence in the
past week, raising questions about the
[SPEAKER_09]: future of religious freedom laws and gay
rights.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I should recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason that this is popping up is
because in Indiana, they just tried to do
[SPEAKER_09]: some rude shit to gay people, citing the
Bible as their reasoning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then these people said, well,
if you're going to cite the Bible for
[SPEAKER_09]: saying, the Bible says, I don't even want
to get into the Bible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks interpretation of the Bible
says that homosexuality is wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say if I agree or
disagree, I'm going to say that that's
[SPEAKER_09]: what that one book says and what people
have read.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, since that is a thing, we're also
saying that in that same book,
[SPEAKER_09]: they've said that all these herbs are here
for us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're playing by these rules on the gay
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're playing by these rules on the pot
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Haha, we win.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of what this church is trying
to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see a Letterman top 10 of his
do's and don'ts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like number one, thou shalt not spill the
bong water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate when people use the Old Testament
as their sort of guide to hating on gays
[SPEAKER_07]: and hating on anything because that's
where all the anti-gay stuff comes from.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't come from the New Testament.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's all about the cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why a lot of people think
that they put the anti-gay thing in the
[SPEAKER_07]: Old Testament was you're living in a
desert, you're living around people who
[SPEAKER_07]: are all trying to kill you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, every baby counts at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Old Testament is just a guide in how
to survive in the desert.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some religions say that you're not
supposed to jerk off because you don't
[SPEAKER_09]: want to waste sperm.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that could have been carrying on our
religion and our race.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all precious.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's continuing on our people so we can
continue to exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to get that chicken
pregnant and keep our religion going.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not living in a desert around a
bunch of hostile barbarians who are trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to kill us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of are.
[SPEAKER_07]: In some ways, yes, I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in a little bit different sense than
back in the day, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the world's grossly overpopulated so
you can have sex with a guy if you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should, you know, do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to do that, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to stop you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never tried, but I'm open if there's
a handsome young guy who wants to take me
[SPEAKER_07]: on a date.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul, you've put yourself out here a lot
on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've hoarded yourself out to the max.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come to my comedy show.
[SPEAKER_09]: My ex-girlfriends come fuck me.
[SPEAKER_09]: New girlfriends come fuck me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And dudes, I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just getting weird with life now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Live a little, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Figured it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Live a little.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret to life.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, man, if that's something
that I don't, I guess I don't feel like
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like weed sacramental to me,
but it's just kind of like a hangout thing
[SPEAKER_08]: to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even do it every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a social thing for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would much rather go and hang out with
somebody, but.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a religious or a spiritual person
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's kind of a way for people
to just smoke pot and kind of abuse it in
[SPEAKER_07]: that way?
[SPEAKER_07]: In that sense?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: My first dab is medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: That first dab makes my shoulders not
hurt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I knocked myself clean the fuck out
a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like clean out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first dab makes that not hurt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Second dab makes me good and high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Third dab, then I'm just dabbed and having
fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: The fourth and fifth dab, that is just me
abusing it because I've got a lot of dabs
[SPEAKER_09]: and I like to see how high we can get
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the morning when I'm here by myself
and I need some thinking to do,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I got to clear my head and I got a lot
of shit on my mind and the world's going
[SPEAKER_09]: too fast for me to get away from it all,
turn off all the lights, turn off the TV,
[SPEAKER_09]: turn off the phone, turn off the computer,
get as silent as I can, roll up a big fat
[SPEAKER_09]: spliff of just flowers, just buds,
buds that I grew, my own personal hidden
[SPEAKER_09]: away bud that nobody else has access to.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody gets to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll that up, smoke a big fatty middle
finger size joint by myself and close my
[SPEAKER_09]: eyes and just see what I am really
thinking because sometimes my head's just
[SPEAKER_09]: going too fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I even really hear what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I get nice and blazed and just
close my eyes and just shut up for a
[SPEAKER_09]: minute and get into that quiet space,
that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, I didn't really, I'm not mad
about some Facebook shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you close your eyes and go into that
bubble, whatever she said on Facebook
[SPEAKER_09]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: That guy talking shit about your Instagram
picture, you don't really care.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're missing your favorite TV show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.
[SPEAKER_09]: You realize like what's inside and it just
kind of, it shows me more what I really
[SPEAKER_09]: need to pay attention to and it kind of
calms me down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I felt like I had the opposite thing
for me, especially since I haven't been
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking pot and smoking anything or doing
anything really for the past like 40 days
[SPEAKER_07]: and 50 days, however many days it's been,
is I was definitely abusing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smoke too much needlessly just to smoke
it, just to see how high I could get,
[SPEAKER_07]: like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't necessarily like clear my mind
or help me think straight or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would kind of just make me think in
worse ways because I was always second
[SPEAKER_07]: guessing myself and I was just
overthinking things and then my brain
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't shut off because of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that I haven't been smoking,
I felt like it's greatly improved like my
[SPEAKER_07]: writing and just my overall sense of
being.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was something I wanted to touch on,
kind of change the vibe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Clint's kind of, I'm going to call
you lightweight, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: You smoke weed like a little girl,
but you're a cheap date.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a big man too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also bring my own weed so that way it's
not even like imposing on anybody else.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he showed up with, I smoked your weed
and it was tasty.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some pretty tasty Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't taste bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't make my mouth burn and it got me
stoned.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was good weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: He came over and he took one rip off of a
pipe.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you write some comedy,
do you like write it when you're straight
[SPEAKER_09]: and then embellish it when you get lit or
how does smoking affect your writing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where does it come into play?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's kind of like, there's two
clents in that aspect because there's
[SPEAKER_08]: stone clents and then there's sober clents
and never the two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoneclent can write some shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the shit that comes out that I
find in my phone when I sober up is,
[SPEAKER_08]: what the fuck was I thinking?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this is so weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember what I was trying to do
with it, but there's no way I would have
[SPEAKER_08]: ever written that sober.
[SPEAKER_08]: I write a lot and in this last month I
haven't written a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just been taking some time away from
comedy just to clear my head, trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: get my medications straight because I'm on
a couple of anti-depressants because old
[SPEAKER_08]: happy Clint wasn't super happy here
recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing group therapy and then seeing a
one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been seeing a therapist too and
that's like my favorite time of the week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go talk with a dude for like an hour and
he's just like, dude, I got you back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care what you say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and I don't do anything that's
terrible, but I don't do anything or I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't feel like I'm doing good enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, what I was getting at is like,
oh, I feel both ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get real introspective like you do
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, what is the problem that I'm
feeling and then deal with it right in
[SPEAKER_08]: that moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've also gotten the way that Paul
gets and where it's like, all right,
[SPEAKER_08]: why is that making me feel this way?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to like quit doing everything that
I do wrong and only work because I got a
[SPEAKER_08]: 13 year old daughter and I'm afraid she's
not going to get to college because she
[SPEAKER_08]: wants to be a surgeon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I start dwelling on that and that
freaks me out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but I get like the super happy way to
like, you know, this joke that I wrote and
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe it's a little bit long, but you go
and edit it when you're sober and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you tell it when you're so,
I only, I don't like getting up in front
[SPEAKER_08]: of people stoned because I feel like
that's my time to be on point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're on the spotlight, you need to
be on the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do a lot of mic time high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I'm not high, it's so much
better for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Doug Benson, bro, I love you,
but I'm going to say this out loud.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel Doug Benson being so high really
squishes his comedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: He could be a better performer if he
weren't so high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I could see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It slows him down.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen him, I personally have gotten
Doug Benson so high before a show that
[SPEAKER_09]: he's just flubbed it complete bits and
looked at me and said, Rasta Jeff,
[SPEAKER_09]: you got me way too high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he told me on stage that I got him
too high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that's, you'd never see a lot of
other comedians.
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't see Bill Cosby doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the silence that you just brought
to the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like picking on Bill Cosby.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like picking on Michael Jackson.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's the people have chosen sides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you decide which side you're on
publicly, then the other side hates you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just going to stay impartial.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, either do I.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to hate me for hating a
rapist.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if him sexually abusing me gets me a
TV spot, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even need to eat the pills,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are going to hate me for
that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, April 7th.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: April 7th.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come see comedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come see comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't come for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come for Mary Mack and her husband.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really funny people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll come for you too.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name is Big.
[SPEAKER_09]: His name is Big.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he have a lot of words, a lot of
letters in it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Tim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim something.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't share the same last names
probably for entertainment reasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about all that changing your
name stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go with your real name.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot more to ask about that,
but we got thrown off track and I have no
[SPEAKER_09]: idea what the fuck I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think we were talking about when we
were writing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's both ways though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I can be stoned and right,
but my inspiration just comes from like
[SPEAKER_08]: the weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, man, like watching an infomercial
and it's like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I thinking about like this
different way to watch YouTube all of a
[SPEAKER_08]: sudden?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of how I started out with just
like trying to write comedy about funny
[SPEAKER_07]: situations or just like little things that
I think of and I can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I have to, it's all written about my
personal experiences and about like my
[SPEAKER_07]: personal feelings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: It keeps it better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when you're telling like,
listen to any artist that's written an
[SPEAKER_09]: album about themselves, it was real.
[SPEAKER_09]: That first album that most people come out
with, it's their real life experience.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That second and third album, it's studio
pressure and they ran out of life
[SPEAKER_09]: experience because now they're just being
a musician or they really took something
[SPEAKER_09]: from that experience and they made another
one.
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of times, and I'm not trying to
say that Matus Yahu's first album,
[SPEAKER_09]: Live It Stuck, he's already blew his load,
but you could tell he spent his whole life
[SPEAKER_09]: writing that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then after that, he's like,
oh, I have to make another album?
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I feel that way about comedy too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you'll see some guys that like their
first comedy special was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: whoa, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you knew that they had worked like 12
years to get that- Just that one hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: That 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, even like the first time I saw Dane
Cook was- I tried so hard not to bring him
[SPEAKER_09]: into this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he was funny back in the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back when we were in high school and
middle school, he was the guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't take that away from him for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know people say, oh, he stole jokes
from people, but 90% of them- Madison
[SPEAKER_08]: Square Garden, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He sold out Madison Square Garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he made comedy blow up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still writing his coat tails because
of him is why like premium blend had him
[SPEAKER_08]: on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't remember a lot of sets other
than like him, but you'll see like he blew
[SPEAKER_08]: up and now we're all riding that coat
tails.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't remember what my point was
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but like his first album, that's what
I mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like his first like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you see him and he's not as funny
anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like going through the motions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched his last special.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was hard to watch, but I could still go
back and watch his first special.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about comedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the best comedy specials I've seen
in a long time is the Bill Burr special
[SPEAKER_09]: that's in black and white.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you get to watch that Paul?
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't watched that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you feel that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the name of the special.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we're on this, we're not even
talking about we today guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk a little bit more
about comedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something we've been watching.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to talk about Rasta and stuff
for a second too on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been watching This Is Not Happening
with Ari Shaffir on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've watched like all 50 something
episodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: This Is Not Happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of it's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to the Comedy Central YouTube channel.

[SPEAKER_09]: Joey Diaz is one of my favorite comedians
ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Rogan does a couple of great ones on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Jay Okerson will make you pee your
pants laughing.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought Kyle Kanane's was really funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a big Kyle Kanane fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's the guy that got in the fight in the
phone booth?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well listen, find that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint's mother, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint's mom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clint's mom's on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: She won.
[SPEAKER_08]: She won that fight in the phone booth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're talking about comedy,
I brought up the event page.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can give everybody the full spiel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary Mack has been on Comedy Central's
Live at Gotham.
[SPEAKER_07]: MBC's Last Comic Standing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Montreal's Just For Laughs Festival on the
San Francisco Sketch Fest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And her husband, Tim Harmston,
has been on Letterman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to have people that have
been on TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're actual people who have done
stuff before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's April 7th, Tuesday.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, come on down, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a good chance I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right near the green light.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right up the street from the green
light.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go check it out and have some laughs,
get some drinks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really cool bar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come eat, Paul, because we've really
described him in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got a Hitler mustache and a teardrop
tattoo from our description.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have thug life tattooed in my eyebrows
and I'm just desperate for companionship.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's thrown that out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to remind everybody of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Extremely desperate.
[SPEAKER_09]: He needs a hug.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what he needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: A mouth hug.
[SPEAKER_07]: A mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: On my penis.
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter what you try to do with these
boys, it always goes back to a dick joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're not comedians.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're open micers.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about the mentality, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, we treat it serious,
but we're not getting paid for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even all that money that Paul's bringing
in, like, yeah, a $5 donation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not going to Paul.
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul ain't making shit on this show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not getting paid at all for this show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buying pizza and beer for the comedians,
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually get sponsored by Paul's Pizza
and Beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Norwood where the taco casa is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have like two topping large pizzas
for like $12.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess how fat he is.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he knows the pizza specials,

Twitter.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're my sponsor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess his weight on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know it because I tell people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess his weight on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a big fan of pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag 257.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, what stops me from committing
suicide is like, well, you're going to eat
[SPEAKER_07]: pizza again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, just make it through tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you listen to that Pete Holmes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you watch, listen to, you made it
weird?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too long and I can't live.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had Henry Rollins on and he goes,
Henry, why do you want people to live
[SPEAKER_08]: longer?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes two words, more pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: Henry Rollins is a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated Henry Rollins until I read his
book, Get in the Van.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have so much respect for that guy after
reading that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put in some work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Created the DC scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a part of the DC scene and then,
you know, created the LA scene with SST
[SPEAKER_07]: records and Black Flag.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, you guys should just do a punk
rock podcast or some sort of- I love punk
[SPEAKER_09]: rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a, not this show, but we're going to
do another podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just called punk rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do one episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll go away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like three minutes long, it'll just yell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a sweet punk rock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it'll just be a punk rock song of a
podcast?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it'll be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite band is Black Flag.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you scream something obnoxious
too, and then we'll punch each other and
[SPEAKER_09]: drink a beer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that'll be the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a good show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a Black Flag kind of show.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just punk rock Mike when you need him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steel Toed Sneakers.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a cool ass band.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if punk rock Mike can still
have the moniker punk rock Mike when he's
[SPEAKER_07]: more of a hobo.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he should just be hobo Mike at
this point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Van by the river Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to put this show back on
track.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I wanted to relate my,
my ganja meditation to your writing
[SPEAKER_09]: session.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when you're just being stoned and
being goofy, that's, you're doing,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're kind of doing the same thing just
in a different way.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're meditating and connecting with
yourself the same way I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm still very new at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just on a different platform.
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't, I don't think that plays.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that there's still more
self-exploration to do that I haven't been
[SPEAKER_08]: willing to do yet because I'm afraid of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to smoke some DMT?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like DMT.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to smoke some DMT.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul just lit up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got a whole new demeanor.
[SPEAKER_07]: His folk life went up on his face.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't test for DMT.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: My probate crystal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never, I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag lighter sounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I have to abstain from alcohol and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say anything about PCP or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dimethyltryptaminer ayahuasca was on that
list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we can't kind of, yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say we can't promote or
condone any use of any illicit or
[SPEAKER_09]: psychedelic drugs, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have real DMT, smoke DMT,
learn about yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm going to say about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to talk too much about it
on the show, but yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it, Clint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to force anybody to do it,
but if you're curious, if there's some
[SPEAKER_09]: shit inside yourself that you want to know
about and you want to get inside your own
[SPEAKER_09]: head.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to know how shitty of a human
being you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or figure out how to stop being such a
shitty human being.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Figure out how to stop being such a shitty
human being.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a good blast of DMT and sit back on
the couch and close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: The debate lately has been open or closed
eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Close your eyes, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the full experience.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: See the colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Smell the smells.
[SPEAKER_09]: Taste the tastes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a whole Starburst commercial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: DMT flavored Starburst.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got almost an hour, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to edit this at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put this out just like it
was.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you didn't say anything too stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did a few plugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your Twitter handle, Paul?
[SPEAKER_07]: VHS underscore nerd.
[SPEAKER_07]: I collect VHS tapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if any of you guys out there want to
get rid of your mom's old VHS collection,
[SPEAKER_07]: or if you have an old VHS collection,
I'd definitely love to go through it and
[SPEAKER_07]: take what you don't want.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a PO box we could ship those
to?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'll just come out and take them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul will come pick up.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll drive all the way to Pennsylvania to
come pick up your VHS tapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit me up on Twitter or check me out on
Instagram, which is just VHS nerd to see
[SPEAKER_07]: all the stuff that I got and, you know,
just drop me a line, ladies.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it hard to find a VCR to play?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole VHS thing is starting to get
really popular.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, because of all the hipsters?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even necessarily think it's
hipsters.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think a lot of new movies are
coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maniac just got remade, not recently,
with the fuck, Frodo Baggins, whatever the
[SPEAKER_07]: fuck that guy's name is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Samwise Gans.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fuck's his name?
[SPEAKER_07]: Elijah Wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Elijah Wood.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see him in fucking Wilfred,
but I just couldn't think of the name.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a new movie.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like a remake that he did that
was released on VHS.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's new VHS releases.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also reissues of a lot of old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: A company just got done reissuing Cannibal
Furo and Cannibal Holocaust, which are
[SPEAKER_07]: some Italian, you know, spaghetti splatter
movies that are really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was waiting for the word spaghetti
splatter to come up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spaghetti splatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spaghetti splatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Italian horror is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's really nothing better than that,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have any Italian horror movies
on tape, let me know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get them to Paul.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you just have an internet connection
where you can like watch stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people like vinyl and they will
not use the iPod.
[SPEAKER_07]: I became a nerd in a video store.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like my favorite thing to do when
my parents would not want to deal with me
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're just like, I'll just take them
to the video store so we can rent a movie
[SPEAKER_07]: and a game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I became a nerd.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, that's where I first saw my
first horror big box and really got
[SPEAKER_07]: intrigued by the cover art.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really why when I go out and I
search through tons and tons of tapes at
[SPEAKER_07]: thrift stores, I see something that I've
never seen before, but the cover art's
[SPEAKER_07]: really good, but the movie's fucking
terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it because the cover art's so good
and I just love shitty movies.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the shittiest, what's the best
shitty movie you've watched?
[SPEAKER_07]: The best shitty movie is definitely You're
the Hunter from the Future.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the shittiest fucking movie I have
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts out kind of like a fantasy epic
where they're fighting dinosaurs and
[SPEAKER_07]: barbarians.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a point when he uses,
he uses a pterodactyl as a hang lighter to
[SPEAKER_07]: kick someone in the face.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it just segues into, now he's the
hunter from the future so I should have
[SPEAKER_07]: seen this coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: It segues into androids and spaceships and
all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the weirdest fucking thing I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can check it out, you can
actually watch it on YouTube for like $3
[SPEAKER_07]: is You're the Hunter from the Future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if any girls want to come over to my
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or any dudes like we heard earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or any dudes, you know, we'll get weird
and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come watch some tapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring your own couch.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's up there with that one and then
Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chopping Mall is fucking great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: HBO or Cinemax.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, remember USA Up all night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's where I saw Chopping Mall.
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's where I saw that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was clean enough to be on USA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was a little guy and my mom would
watch USA Up all night with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably where we saw it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first time that I saw Toxic
Avenger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up Toxy?
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the Toxic Avenger.
[SPEAKER_07]: My hero.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monster hero.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trauma.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two copies on VHS.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an unrated copy and I have the
edited R rated copy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just giving everybody an option to
go see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they want to go watch it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't seen the Toxic Avenger and
you love pot, you should definitely get
[SPEAKER_07]: really high and then watch the Toxic
Avenger.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right Clint, it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do we find you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_09]: He hasn't been doing much social media you
guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's taking a break.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's letting his brain simmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been going crazy with social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: So check me out on shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also check out the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should probably keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have t-shirts too, Clint.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_09]: You do.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're cozy.

[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Busy, busy year ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to do every cup?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably going to skip Seattle this
year, but we are doing Oregon,
[SPEAKER_06]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll also be doing the 7-10 Cup in
Denver, and we have the San Francisco Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sour Seeds is killing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is CannaVenture joining for everything?
Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you smoking on over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Some Jeff soju.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you got the Jeff soju.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a Dante.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a ... Come from KarmaCeuticals in
Denver, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We acquired the cut through Dan Hayet,
who was recently in Tide Times last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a homegrown Pueblo caregiver right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He tested out a couple of strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: His Dante tested 28.8, and his kilowatt
was 29.3.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Impressive test.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually tested it three times over
each test.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did the first sample for the first
$50, and then they gave him the rest of
[SPEAKER_06]: the samples for free just to make sure
they didn't make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so high.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, he's been doing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was working with Dan Sky from High
Times Magazine right now, and he's out in
[SPEAKER_06]: Westcliff doing his thing this year,
and hopefully we'll see him around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's invited to the podcast, if you want
to bring him on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know the guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Dan, the man.
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to come into shop all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good guy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he gave me the cut, and it's
actually pineapple grenades crossed with a
[SPEAKER_06]: Skunk 666.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've taken it now, and we're taking it
a step further in creating the Dante's
[SPEAKER_06]: Inferno, which is the same hybrid crossed
out with the OG18.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually going to ask a few breeding
questions and stuff of you on the show,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it sounds like a good time.
[SPEAKER_09]: My first question is going to be to both
of you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: How did you get into the breeding game,
and how long have you been breeding?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually been breeding since I was
about 15 or 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: My parents were longtime growers in the
state of Florida, South Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were underground growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had large horticulture nursery,
about five and a half, six acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a whiteout greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a 30 by 100 feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Full of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Florida?
[SPEAKER_06]: In Florida.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got balls of steel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your parents had balls of steel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom actually took her until she was
almost 60 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And recently, the last five years,
she actually did get incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and it was kind of messed up because
it is just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she was busted with around 24
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: She did get a slap on the wrist board.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately for her, they did find
out the FBI came in, and they were doing a
[SPEAKER_06]: drug sting.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guys were taking the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were taking the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were stealing the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were stealing the cannabis,
and they were flipping it back on the
[SPEAKER_06]: streets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about 12 officers were involved in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was in big news down in Tampa,
Florida last year or so, last couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your mom's kind of a celebrity for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been a freedom fighter her whole
life.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we call her on the show to give
her a shout out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sherry, mama.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big shout out, Sherry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big shout out for being a cannabis
warrior.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is she free now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is she out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's here, and now she's living in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep her out of trouble here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's absolutely it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's loving the freedom.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's loving the mountains, the atmosphere
and the people, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people, the attitude's great here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome home, mama sour seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll keep you out of trouble here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Rusty, my friend with Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, you're a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I met you today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have some fucking fun times
together, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long have you been in this breeding
game?
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess about six years, but I mean,
I've been breeding forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: What grower doesn't see plants?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long into your growing career did it
take you to get breeding?
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I'd say for the first...
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, four or five years.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just straight growing and first get
started, outdoor, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd say like six, seven years before,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's how long it takes you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four to six years seems to be for most of
the major breeders that I've talked to.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I grew those plants the first couple
of years, I knew I had to breed,
[SPEAKER_09]: but then you have to figure out how and
where.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being from the area that we were in in the
underground, you couldn't just back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: early 90s and stuff and being in places
like Florida, which is one of the worst
[SPEAKER_06]: states to possibly grow it in,
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Places like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: East coast is really, really throw you
under the bus, lock you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you couldn't really order seeds and
get certain strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whenever you got good genetics and you
got good males, you may do with what you
[SPEAKER_06]: had.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you used a lot of older genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally used a lot of older genetics
when we were younger from parents passed
[SPEAKER_06]: down, Gainesville green, old Afghans,
a lot of old Afghani and stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of the old piney, good piney buds
that came out of Florida back in the day
[SPEAKER_06]: in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Florida's known for a lot of great
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the past few years, they've really been
known for it and noticed.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say in the last 10 years,
there's actually been statistics to show
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's more growers indoors that get
busted every year in Florida than there
[SPEAKER_06]: are registered cannabis users in
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we see this all the time on this show.
[SPEAKER_09]: The logical step here, fucking legalize it
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why you banging down little old
ladies doors and dragging them out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because your mom, I'm pretty sure,
at her age now, she's a hardcore criminal,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure she was ready to wreck some shit.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Opened the door for them and told them to
come right on in.
[SPEAKER_06]: She made them cookies while the joint on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just about.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's one of those types of women,
but my mom's a really cool lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: She gets you high first and then makes you
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on in, officer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll roll a joint while you cuff
everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's totally her attitude.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad she's here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we get to smoke out one day if
she's still a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to get it back on course,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: We get so ADD'd in this show.
[SPEAKER_09]: ADD.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of skipped over how long you've
been breeding a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've been breeding for about six
years, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been in the game for about six
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I've been selling seeds for like
six years or so, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: But definitely since I started,
10, 11 years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some of your favorite strains
that you've... What are some of your now
[SPEAKER_09]: current favorite strains to grow?
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as like clone onlys or... Whatever
you were going to like.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I was like, so you can fill this whole
room with whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get three strains to pick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say cookie rack, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool choice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cookies a little fucking whatever,
you know, but out of proportion.
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I've seen... Shout out to Garden
of Weed and grow the shit out of your
[SPEAKER_09]: cookie rack.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you owe them a high five.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Triple Nova.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a new... That's some pack I brought
you today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll run that pretty soon to take
pictures.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Triangle Kush and Blackberry Kush
Clone BX out cross by train rack,
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcada.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Head seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This BX too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: My third one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on one now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Texas Kids Bloody Mary Cut.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty rare cut, but working that
back with Orange Diesel.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Cali.
[SPEAKER_10]: 77 Cut and Calio Cut with Verites or no,
Soma's New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything Soma I love.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that sounds like a great cross.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a great cross there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, random question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have an offshoot of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those your top sellers by any chance?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know one can't be because you're
still making it, but the cookie rack
[SPEAKER_09]: sounds like it's probably one of your top
sellers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cookie rack, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's definitely one of your top sellers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great, great stream.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen coal as long as my arms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It matches up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both parents match up just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't sound like it, but once you get
to know both parents, it definitely
matches.
[SPEAKER_09]: From the breeder aspect, you could tell
that that's a beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, here's a hint that I don't talk
about a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: The more difference, the most difference
in your parents, the better the outcome in
[SPEAKER_09]: your cross.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got completely different
parents, the better your crosses are going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Natural selection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So bro over here, Mr. Sour Seeds,
what are some of your favorite strains to
[SPEAKER_09]: grow?
[SPEAKER_09]: Top three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Top three.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably say one of my number one
strains is still to this day is probably
[SPEAKER_06]: the original Chem Dog D or Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_06]: To this day, it's not the frosty strain in
the world, but it has some of the greatest
[SPEAKER_06]: flavors all around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just got the bang.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the punch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bag of peel, the yield, the smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of the original true OGs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say right now too, it still is one of
my family's original strains from way
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've held this cut for probably close to
eight to 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of our original blueberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the old original blueberry Yum Yum
used to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear about from Lou to Chris and back
in the day and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not DJ's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very indica dominant blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost smells like ripe oranges halfway
through flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it really takes on a really sweet
blueberry peel during finish and ripening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very potent, very frosty,
very couch lock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, quick eight, nine weeks or,
you know, it's a very indica plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to take you 10 weeks to
flower out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And another one we run is probably a big
one that we're having a big release on now
[SPEAKER_06]: is the bass dragon, which is a true West
Himalayan Cush land race crossed with the
[SPEAKER_06]: original Kim 91 back cross male.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was, this was a cross that was
done probably seven, eight years ago in
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now it's one of the hottest
things in Atlanta, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been nice for years down there and
in Rand, Tallahassee, Florida and FSU
[SPEAKER_06]: college for, I don't know how many years
we slung that stuff out on some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: streets and people can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've, we've gotten reviews from
everywhere from, you know, the little guy
[SPEAKER_06]: to people that fight for the UFC.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, we, we've actually sold pot to people
like Sebastian, Sebastian Janikowski and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, big football players.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, it's, it's the guys,
they, they just can't, they can't get
[SPEAKER_06]: enough of the space dragon, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is just, it's, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's devastating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It lays you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you really can't think on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's one of those, even for the
heavy smoker, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: something like that, that just,
you really want to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, just really,
I mean, cause you build up tolerance over
[SPEAKER_06]: years and years and years of doing this
and you'd look for sought out strains that
[SPEAKER_06]: you, you know, that, that won't burn you
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, seven, eight years,
I can still smoke this stuff and it still
[SPEAKER_06]: does the same effect to me that it did
back in the day, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're, so we're trying to- That's
kind of an old school, new school kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: a combo there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like you said, very diverse
genetics, you know, taking something from
[SPEAKER_06]: here in America and then taking it with
the best of the, you know, the East,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and across the world,
you know, and just trying to combine those
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics to give somebody something
really, really special.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm imagining kind of a real spicy,
real hashy, earthy, spicy, kind of a
[SPEAKER_09]: smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is real earthy and it has a spice to
it, but it's actually, it almost,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's really hard to really describe,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, it's, it's been described as
like really sweet, but also has like a
[SPEAKER_06]: very overwhelming sense of BO,
like body odor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Jeff's OG he's playing with has a,
like a swampy, funky foot, BO kind of a
dough to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's really BO to it, but it's,
it's on the sweeter side and it has that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, that kind of citrusy twang kind of
funk from the Kim 91 in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's, it's really original.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, really unique and anybody
that's ever had it really, truly enjoyed
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I look forward to my seed pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or my clone, you know, there's,
yeah, I can do that for you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing like a clone from your
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Clones are better.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was two strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got the cam and then you got your
space dragon.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's strain number three?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: See dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to blame it on a head injury.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can probably do one or two more episodes
with a head injury.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you guys have been listening
and you heard about that, I had a serious,
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a serious concussion, but I had a
minor brain bleed and I was down for
[SPEAKER_09]: about, it's been seven days now and I'm
still a little goofy when I wake up and it
[SPEAKER_09]: takes me like an hour to get my shit
together, but I'm going to be fine guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of people told me to get well and
I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: My brain was bleeding inside my head.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: My eyes were wobbling and shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a little goofy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you've listened to the last two
episodes, I was doing that fully
[SPEAKER_02]: concussed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently I blew off two people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was supposed to meet somebody somewhere
and I blew them off completely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so somebody was nice enough to say he
hit his head.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please be nice about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at least you had a legitimate excuse
this time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this time I wasn't just dabbing on
the couch like last time.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are your three favorites.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which of those, oh, he's coughing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got to give him a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: So are those, since one's not released
yet, are those your best sellers or do you
[SPEAKER_09]: even release the, you can't sell the
blueberry yum yum because it's not yours
[SPEAKER_09]: to release, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is mine to release.
[SPEAKER_06]: So far I'm the only one in Colorado that
has that cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought it here from Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually brought it in the computer
case 2000 miles over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are mad men.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are mad men.
[SPEAKER_06]: We take the risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: We take the risk and we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we, we tried to bring some
diverse genetics this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We only brought, you know, a couple of
strains with us, but it was our best,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and then that's what we brought
with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the old, old strains are dead and
gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gainesville green is dead and gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is dead and gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My uncle actually had a big hand in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today, to this day, you know,
he still grows cannabis, but he's
[SPEAKER_06]: completely blind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he literally takes care of massive
greenhouses and his plants look beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: and amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's been growing the same strains,
blueberry yum yum, Gainesville green and
[SPEAKER_06]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as I know, I haven't,
I haven't talked to that man in so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good guy to get in contact with,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's, it's, it's,
it's sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's like a lot of the old skunks,
the old original skunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've all these have been outcrossed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's things that you can find
in Florida that are very close,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's an outcross.
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up in SoCal and there was a skunk
strain there that I've never smelled since
[SPEAKER_09]: I've left that area.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in the Long Beach area.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was where my herb was coming from.
[SPEAKER_09]: And dude, I've never smelled anything like
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The closest I've gotten was I was at a
Phil Lesh and Friends show at Red Rocks in
[SPEAKER_09]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this dude said, humble gold for sale.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I remember the old humble and I
walked over there and I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: how much for a quarter, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like 90 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I handed him a hundred dollar bill and
just walked away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was as close as I've gotten since I
left California to the smell of just that
[SPEAKER_09]: Cali dank.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of miss it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every once in a while you do,
you come across that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very rare though, nowadays,
you know, that it hasn't been put its
[SPEAKER_06]: hands on or it's, it's really locked down
on inner circles.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Canaventure, do you prefer to grow or
breed sativas or Indicors?
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucked that question up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you prefer to grow and breed Indicors
or sativas is what I was aiming for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to take more dads.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to dab while you answer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Preferably, man, I like, I like to smoke
like sativa hybrids.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, I do breed with some straight up a
hundred percent Indica, real Indica stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you got to keep those.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the CBD patients, Indica
patients, neither medicine too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to, you have to, you have to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tend to catch myself breeding heavier
toward the sativa side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just cause you like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that 10 or 17 day extra longer
flowering period really does something to
[SPEAKER_09]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not an Indica smoker.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, even at nighttime, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I've gotten older, I feel like
smoking Indica just makes me too lazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I own a company.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a job.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I got to be, so I take dabs of
sativa to keep me moving and motivated.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, I really don't smoke
Indica's man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you still have some that you love,
you know, that, you know, that are good,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I don't know, preferably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something I find weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like growing, smoking, and breeding
completely different strains for different
[SPEAKER_09]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm going to grow one, I pick a root
for growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm going to breed, I want these.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm going to smoke, I want this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like completely different batches of
plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about yourself, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually an Indica guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an Indica guy and I like OG cushions a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's pretty much what I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like stuff that puts me to the couch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of need it nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing this a really long time
and I've always had a lot of strong pot
[SPEAKER_06]: around, you know, that, that's the thing
with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really grow up smoking swag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always had good homegrown, you know,
and that's why I build the tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you're like 15 years old and you
can out smoke, you know, your parents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, so, so it takes something
like that for me, but like, like you said,
[SPEAKER_06]: like when I, when I'm working,
if I'm doing some like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy labor or anything like that,
working in the gardens and things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that is the great, that's, that's when the
blue dream comes out, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah, that's pretty much my main
sativa that I will run is my Cali cut blue
[SPEAKER_06]: dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the cut that goes around this town
a lot?
[SPEAKER_09]: Real tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the nice thin blade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super, super frosty.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hit that with a grateful dog,
Pollen, and she's been called blue healer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: She does that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That cut does wonderful work with every,
it is a true breeding cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hardly get it to, it is a hard to
cut even to get the reverse.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, it is so stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can stress it out, kick it down the
street.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to perform every single time,
no matter really what you hit it with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't talked about this on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is way off the topic that I had
written, but you guys will be two people
[SPEAKER_09]: to appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I should ask, do you work with
any, uh, feminized seeds, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: I do, man.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing it for, I've been
talking about it for probably three or
[SPEAKER_10]: four years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like it's selling out a little bit,
but in, but look, okay, let me clear
[SPEAKER_10]: myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's taken me a while to get there,
but there is absolutely a purpose for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, totally, you know, it's undeniable
really honestly.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I did it was because I wanted
to replicate a strain that I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_09]: good, another cross for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I don't want to outbreed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to duplicate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just selfed it and made,
that's how I made one of my strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was definitely a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a whole lot going on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just reverse the plant, you know,
I don't, I don't make as near as much
[SPEAKER_09]: pollen as I do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, that's why I don't,
that's you guys, that's why everybody's
[SPEAKER_09]: sold out of my seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I can't make enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got room for all the plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can't make enough pollen to hit all
these plants with.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a dab and then I'll tell
you why I was talking about FEMINIC.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm honestly going to try to remember
while I take this dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a purpose for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you know, like, like Jeff was
saying, you know, it's a lot about the
[SPEAKER_06]: preservation, the preservation of clone
only or, you know, save even if it's your
[SPEAKER_06]: own hybrid and you run through a hundred
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you find that one perfect female,
that super female, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, that right there, that's a perfect,
perfect example of why you should FEMINIZE
[SPEAKER_06]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stabilize it right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we've done with our space
dragon.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, is just S1 it,
give everybody the same version that we've
[SPEAKER_06]: grown to love for seven, eight years,
you know, and the only way to really do
[SPEAKER_06]: that truly is to not out-cross it,
is to FEMINIZE it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot more fun out-crossing it
though, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is because of the variety, like you
were saying, the diversity of genetics,
[SPEAKER_06]: to find, watch nature take over the
natural selection and just watch,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, just just watch it take hold and
really do what nature does, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do what nature does.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give a huge shout out talking
about doing what nature does.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gage Green Genetics is an F1 monster
putting out the F1 to show in diversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys know what that means,
you'll give them a shout out for that too.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't understand that you'll catch
up as you listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gage puts out, I don't trust most F1s,
but Gage's F1s are amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what he does.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gage has something special going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keyplay and that crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what names they want me to
use, but shout out to Keyplay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the entire Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll call him Mike.
[SPEAKER_09]: MK4.
[SPEAKER_09]: MK4.
[SPEAKER_09]: MK4.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the EDT thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, shout out to that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys do amazing work.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look up to them a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't realize how much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to do a lot of test work for Gage
Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got done running through some
eight, like seven, eight-year-old beans
[SPEAKER_06]: with the original Grape Stomper Release.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we found a Sour Ball Smino.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so excited about this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be doing a lot of work with
it soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gage and the Cali Connection kind of put
my brand on the map.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sent me free gear to run for them and
let me take pictures.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they published my pictures in
high times and skunk mag and shit like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always seriously generous to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the newcomers into the game,
they'll even give you a chance and give
[SPEAKER_06]: you some seeds to get started.
[SPEAKER_09]: Showed me mad love when we all met up at
the Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: They, Swerve and the whole Gage crew,
they all gave me mad, mad love.
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent most of my time at the Cali
Connection booth and the rest of my time
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Gage booth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Cup last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I remember what I was going to say
about reversing plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a strain that I... So I had a plant
and I selfed it and made seeds out of
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kept the original mommy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I took seeds and grew the seeds
until I found one that looked just like
[SPEAKER_09]: mommy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I reversed mommy again and put
that pollen on this female.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can't get that offspring to reverse.
[SPEAKER_09]: I found a beautiful female that is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been labeled GD 77.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she can't, I cannot reverse her with
undiluted colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not colloidal silver, silver
thiosulfate, a hundred percent just push.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she just looked at me like,
nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really true keeper there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the true breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I kind of hosed myself because that's
one of my breeders and I was hoping to be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to still reverse that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to go back to the other clone.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that is definitely... I was told
I'm one of the only breeders that's doing
[SPEAKER_09]: solid stress tests on my seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I'll breed with the female,
I'll take like say I'm going to breed with
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would take Blue Dream and put her in a
room by herself or with whatever else I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: testing and run the light cycle for two
weeks the way she should in flower and
[SPEAKER_09]: then disrupt it and like turn it to the
opposite and see if I can make her her.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you... That's your mom?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, then I'll use those to breed.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I really got to kick their ass to make
them her, then I'll use them.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they her too easily, I'll toss them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't even waste my time with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to put out more her stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's something I've talked about a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm way off on my notes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just like this random chatter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you guys will have an answer to this
question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I reversed a Golden Goat plant and I took
the pollen and I put it on four other
[SPEAKER_09]: plants and it made great stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the plants, the headband plant,
shriveled up and died when the pollen hit
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the pistols went new and it shriveled
up and... Straight up died?
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant died?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It died.
[SPEAKER_09]: The lights were going off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I pollinated right before sunset or lights
out and just hit the pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched, hung out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh, lights are going out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I left the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I came back the next day to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant was dead, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other plants in the room were all...
Everybody was happy, iry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's getting the same treatment
except that headband plant over in the
[SPEAKER_09]: corner was like, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm the only one that had access,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody touches my breeding shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually never seen that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say that's one of the other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone looked at me like, yeah,
you did something really wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you fed that plant battery acid or
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wondered if maybe anybody had seen that,
but no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's looking at me like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm trying it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in that room behind us, there's a
reversed golden goat in that room in there
[SPEAKER_09]: with headband.
[SPEAKER_09]: What did it kill?
[SPEAKER_09]: A headband?
[SPEAKER_09]: It killed a headband.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got a headband and gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just hate each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Kalanji Kush in there and then a
lemon skunk to make some more lemon
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's a whole bunch of golden
goats in there to make some golden goat
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody loves that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lemon Jeffrey and golden goat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: The pollen is almost falling.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost dropping.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's almost busted.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that lemon?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that lemon cut?
[SPEAKER_09]: The lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from Arian's Greenhouse Seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Greenhouse Seeds from Arian.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one of his Femme packs a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought it as a gift.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I love lemon turps and somebody
bought me that pack.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to run it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I got the biggest cut of that,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be like 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, we'll trade some cuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole table, we'll get together and
we'll just add some cuts to the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I feel it's really all about,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too much of a shark tank out there
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of us that's been doing this a
long time, a lot of us started out
[SPEAKER_06]: underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really need to stick together and keep
to those circles and help each other out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes less of a shark tank and more
happy environment for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like a cheater being a Colorado
breeder because I got to cheat.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys had to hide and do that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't even go to the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would follow you home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's how my mother got busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually said they slid across the
street in the East coast and they run your
[SPEAKER_06]: tags and then that's all they need.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need that number and they can get
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: They come knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_09]: Enter your name, address, what kind of
insurance you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys look out for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on the East coast listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go to the hydro store too often.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just move.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just move.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or legalize it where you are because the
states that have legal cannabis are
[SPEAKER_09]: getting full and prices are going up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's rent's going up everywhere now
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: So legalize it where you are so that way
you don't have to move here and pay 1200
[SPEAKER_09]: bucks for a small apartment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to ask the crazy question
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you guys feel about auto flowering
seeds?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, I really don't care for them
particularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't like to grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have grown plenty of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the breeding process of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been asked to grow them and breed
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel a true auto flower needs to be
80, 90 days to 120 days from start to
[SPEAKER_06]: finish and not these 60 day, 30 day,
whatever they're trying to push on the
[SPEAKER_06]: market right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way for a plant to get properly
mature to give you really anything worth a
[SPEAKER_06]: dime at the end of it or worth its weight
in the effort that you put into that
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you can do the same thing,
I have grown regular seeds, 12 and 12 from
[SPEAKER_06]: seed and got ounces off of them before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's faster than 90 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's faster than what an auto flower can
give it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not going to suffer your
potency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now for cash croppers and things like
that, that's probably where they're
[SPEAKER_06]: probably most appealing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting multiple crops or they do,
I feel they do have a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_06]: place in like stealth place, like Florida,
places like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do small grows, small little
plants and do a bunch of them and do
[SPEAKER_06]: feminized, you know, and stay under the
radar very well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was a huge cartel that got
busted in a national forest around here
[SPEAKER_09]: running a bunch of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my opinion, that's where they
originally started from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Auto, they'd grown about waist high and
just flower, you know, so they could just
[SPEAKER_09]: line them up.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a plot of like 50 feet by 50 feet
here and then wait three weeks and plot
[SPEAKER_09]: another plot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a lot of things that go
around online and on the internet and
[SPEAKER_06]: different hearsay about where auto flowers
originally came from, whether it came from
[SPEAKER_06]: lowrider, this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really, truly where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff was the Mexican drug cartels and they
learned how to, they started breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: their own cannabis with Kansas City
ditchweed, basically hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ruderalis to get it to flower
automatically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they figured out they could get three
seasons a year in the same time and push
[SPEAKER_06]: it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why the swag just became even
more swaggier.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to this day though, what we're seeing
is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're seeing the push it that
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not even selling any weed anymore
to America.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Mexican weed is not even worth a dime
coming over the border.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exactly the opposite of what the
government said would happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're actually, but it pissed them off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear that they're doing other things to
like try to make more money and get back
[SPEAKER_09]: at us now because they're mad.
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course that's how they're going to
roll, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're stealing lines.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as indoors, growing autos indoors,
I mean you're saving two weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're better at bed, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, for real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Learn to canopy management like we've
talked about on the show, then you'll get
[SPEAKER_09]: that same weight or better phenotype
selection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't clone your auto flowers what
if you find that?
[SPEAKER_09]: What if you find that amazing?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, oh, that was fun.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: The few times I've had really great auto
flowers and good experiences with auto
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers, it was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pop real seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pop real seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, you know, that great sex for
one night and then- I was going to say
[SPEAKER_09]: that, but I wasn't going to compare it to
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I let someone else use that
analogy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even that good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like knowing that amazing girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were all thinking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were all dudes in this room.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give you guys a shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You brought me, Rob brought me a dab
shirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking across the table and the two
gentlemen joining me have this dab shirt.
[SPEAKER_09]: The logo looks sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Representing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me want to take a dab every time
I see that logo.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be rocking it one day at the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a long Cannabis Cup weekend coming
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really means a lot to me to have my
artwork out there like that, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: To have people like it, enjoy it,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something, I agree with you,
when you walk through the Cannabis Cup and
[SPEAKER_09]: someone's wearing your logo and you don't
even know, I just took a big fat puff off
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm holding it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they're wearing your logo and they
high five you and they're excited to see
[SPEAKER_09]: you and you're like, I just made a friend.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look forward to meeting you guys at the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: People walk up.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you know me, if you listen to the show,
walk up, high five me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some platinum OG dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some black cherry Kim dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some Jeff's OG dabs and I'm taking
to the cup with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you find me at the right time,
if I'm not out, I'll dab you out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chances are it won't have any seeds with
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a private party Friday night and
they're going to be gone before I even
[SPEAKER_09]: leave that party.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, y'all.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, you're both from different
states.
[SPEAKER_09]: You grew in other states where it was
crazy and now you came here and you're
[SPEAKER_09]: able to set up shop and grow and do your
breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot less stressful.
[SPEAKER_09]: The breeding laws here, it's kind of gray
area and the breeding, but they keep
[SPEAKER_09]: changing the rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everywhere we move to grow, they keep
changing the rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that messing you guys up?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter what happens here, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what it really boils down to,
like he's saying, when you're a true
[SPEAKER_06]: grower, nothing's going to stop you from
doing what you love.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that not just cannabis or growing,
I think it goes for all levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's something that you really love to
do, regardless of who is the government to
[SPEAKER_06]: tell you that you cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing I could never stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really not going to affect me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm out in the county, things like that,
so I really don't have to worry about the
[SPEAKER_06]: new, but the ordinances now with the,
you know, like Pueblo, no more outdoor
[SPEAKER_06]: growing in city limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can't grow outdoors in our city
limits at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was killed by a couple of specific
growers because they had the dank outside
[SPEAKER_09]: and they just had six foot tall plants
over the fence that smelled all the way
[SPEAKER_09]: down to the high school down the street.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that pissed off kind of a few people.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a question I've never asked
anybody on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you had to pick one, either growing or
smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
Growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that that means we're all in this
right thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all in it with our hearts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys didn't even have to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I couldn't smoke cannabis,
my lungs gave out tomorrow or somewhere,
[SPEAKER_06]: some crazy reason that I couldn't smoke
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares about smoking?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still, it's a learning tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, Jeff, you used to play drums.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that release, that release that you
get.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your energy going into a good thing
and you can help other people.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can be in the worst mood and I don't
usually get in a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like fishing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: A bad day in the garden is better than a
good day at most other things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can just go in the garden and there's
always something to do and you just go in
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next thing you know, it's been 30 or 40
minutes and you're more- You wish you had
[SPEAKER_09]: another hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a podcast on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully you're listening to the Grow
From Your Heart podcast or some good
[SPEAKER_09]: reggae music.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just in there taking off the dead
leaves or just tilling the top soil or
[SPEAKER_09]: just staring.
[SPEAKER_09]: I catch myself just almost masturbating to
the garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to buy them drinks and throw
dollars at them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, these ladies are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, if you understand what I'm saying,
you're listening to the right podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what growing is all about.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to throw dollar bills at your
sexy plants, you're growing some sexy
[SPEAKER_09]: bitches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stripper OG, I'm claiming the name right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stripper OG.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're taking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been going about 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you approved.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was very excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have dried up a little more than
I wanted, but awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys approve, then that means it's
good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can someone find, other than
naturesgreenremedies.com and the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: Cup this fall, where can people find your
seeds, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: Me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine will just be there, the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Naturesgreenremedies.com and you'll find
us at the 710 Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: The 710 Cup in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about yourself, Mr. Cantaventure?
[SPEAKER_09]: Attitude, Depo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Will the seeds get to us if we order them
from Attitude right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of speculation, so you heard
it right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't ordered seeds from them in a
while, but- You heard it right there,
[SPEAKER_09]: guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cantaventure says you can get them from
The Tude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Order them up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a coupon code or anything?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a promo going on there though,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some free seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, I'll Google it right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think 80% on some Triple Nova.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to go up a week before the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this will be up April 13th-ish,
so people will hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'll have a really cool Cannabis Cup
episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm loading the webpage.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to the Attitude Seed Bank right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't gone here in a long time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I got some free seeds on there
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give you a proper shout out on
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have done some pre-show research,
but- I don't even know, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: These companies change so often that it's
hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't keep track of sales.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't keep track.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just send seeds and I take orders,
send seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even check it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I play the I don't know role.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow seeds end up in nature's green
remedies.
[SPEAKER_09]: They handle all that for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't do sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do Bitcoin now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not advertising so much for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard Attitude, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard they stopped doing credit cards.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing Bitcoin.
Wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they show you how to get the
Bitcoins too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they're trying to change it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, you do not have a promo this
month.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not on the front page.
[SPEAKER_09]: But still guys, support that spot because
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as they- Do you pay for the
fucking guaranteed shipping?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's- Yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a shirt out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a mug or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a mug.
[SPEAKER_09]: I recommend getting a mug because they
sent me a really cool DNA genetics mug and
[SPEAKER_09]: I passed that on as a Christmas gift.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The shirts aren't as cool as the mugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I got a Dr. Moon shirt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one with some hell betty looking
shit right in the missile.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked really obscene, but I just
wrapped other stuff up in it and sent it
[SPEAKER_09]: on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's coming up in the future for Sour
Seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots, lots in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: We plan to go, I say worldwide by the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we can keep up with the demand
and really do well this year, we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to do a big tour and we're going to have a
lot of- We're just going to go out there
[SPEAKER_06]: and have fun with it, man, and do what I
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any plan to get your seeds on
shelves in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big, big, big thing for us too.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the year, we're actually
going to go with our own medically infused
[SPEAKER_06]: products license.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have 40 acres in Colorado City,
A1 Agricultural.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to go big.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just going to grow and grow from
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're also starting our own clothing
company, High Life Apparel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff looks good, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought me a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just all custom done designs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any one's welcome to bring a design.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we can print it and you like it and
other people like it, we'll print it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like local artists.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to bring to that whole
scene is local artists.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see your design being worn at the
cannabis cut by one of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's a good feeling,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a good feeling to get your
artwork out there and just to have it seen
[SPEAKER_06]: by others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you never know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could be the next greatest artist in
the world and you never know what tomorrow
[SPEAKER_06]: can hold for a person that just drives
himself to do things.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy speaks the truth, y'all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Canaventure, what's coming up in the
future, my friend?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing?
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys just chilling?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Done?
[SPEAKER_09]: You giving it up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just going to keep smoking pot and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love that approach.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love that approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wearing a sweater and a beanie.
[SPEAKER_09]: A cardigan.
[SPEAKER_09]: A cardigan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I couldn't think of the prop.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell he's been in the industry a
lot longer than us.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's already comfortable.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just like, I'm just going to smoke
pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take some dabs and see what those guys
figured out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put some pollen on some
plants, take some seeds out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send those to the attitude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nature's green remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do what I do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take another dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, it's been cool, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, you see how that works?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just fucking let some shit go like that
guy just did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we all do that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell we were going to have fun the
minute you walked in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, Rusty's great character.
[SPEAKER_09]: I made a friend for life.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see like a clone trading session and
possibly I'm going to kind of say collab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've actually been talking about
doing some collab and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's got the best mail, the best steady
mail?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I got a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's definitely got a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some pretty good mails.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had that Chem D back across mail and it
does wonderful work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost identical replica to the
original Chem Dog D.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you look at them side by side and
it's hard to tell which one is the male,
[SPEAKER_06]: which one is the female.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in veg, you couldn't really tell
between the two, but we can do a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: cool things with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to do a lot of great work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a new Sour Alien dog coming out
and it's basically an Alien OG white fire
[SPEAKER_06]: and that Chem Dog D.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep on the lookout, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sour Seeds is coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be putting out some fire
shit, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that fix it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, see, I told you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, I'm going to do another shout out on
this piece of equipment, the Live Wire
[SPEAKER_09]: Solutions HA04.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't ever buy one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That sound you heard was me smacking on it
to make it work properly to bring Rusty's
[SPEAKER_09]: channel back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the same people that brought you
Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it probably?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo's great, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to start closing up the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can people find you online?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have like a website or something?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Milehighdank.co.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have an Instagram page?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, yes, Sour Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sour Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check them out there, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about a Twitter?
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Twitter yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not on the Twitter yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a forum on your website also,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, our whole web forum.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a straight up web forum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody's welcome to join.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growers helping growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody, we can lend you a hand if you
need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We look to see a lot of our own genetics
and we have Rasta Jeff on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Cannaventure on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see our genetics online.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see what you get out of our
genetics and how much you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that feel, man, when you just
scroll through a website and see somebody
[SPEAKER_09]: killing it with your creations?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like another piece of artwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just there's anything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all a work of art.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes you like a proud pop up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your trophy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, that's really what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like the breeder should be able to
grow this shit out of his creation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you send those seeds to just
somebody else, somebody buys them,
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't even know who the hell they are
and they kill it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, oh man, that means they do
that strain right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you were saying about F1 seeds,
that's a lot of like what we do too at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time as with Gage Green and a lot of
the other guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your chance to find a clone only
that nobody has.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your chance to find that gym.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big shout out to Van Bear.
[SPEAKER_09]: He killed it with some of my double eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see the plant through the
trichomes and it looks great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he did it with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is actually impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people diss on the LEDs and he
killed it with those.
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it looks like LEDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: All his pics are purple in the background.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming it's LEDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Van Bear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he's on my forum.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's on, if you go to iregionxcolorado
.com, there's a forum and I'll check out
[SPEAKER_09]: your guys' forum a little more often.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys go to mine and we'll all
check out Van Bear's pictures.
[SPEAKER_09]: See the killer work he did.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working with a combination of LED and
high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've been rolling with for a
little while now and it does a wonderful
[SPEAKER_06]: work, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, would you, Rod, smells good?
[SPEAKER_09]: We only took a couple puffs because
everybody got lit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this was, unfortunately,
this was, you know, seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed weed would do what we got right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys feel like the seeded plants
make a different kind of a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: spectrum?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's a really cool looking light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that most of the plant's full
potential is going into making offspring.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, whoever did that room, whoever set
that room up, it was a high five.
Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: All those LEDs and icons.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fucking legit, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I completely think that we make hash
out of all the plants that I run that have
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just pull the seeds out and make hash
out of all of it because why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you pull all the seeds out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like all of them?
[SPEAKER_09]: The way we do it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of have to do it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes weird, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that hash gets you higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets you a different, it's like a full
body high.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the head high, the body high,
you get the eye high, you get cotton
[SPEAKER_09]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like all those cannabinoids are
in there when you let the plant seed
[SPEAKER_09]: itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at my fingers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what are you even doing,
man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Plucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's all black-fingered over here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got rubber gloves, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what a raw dog is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of raw dog, do you guys have a
website?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually it's being redesigned,
but we got a forum, sign up to that forum
[SPEAKER_10]: for a free weekly giveaways.

on us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, I wouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been around a little longer?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're all hanging out now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to collab, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to use that Kim D male.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the two of us will throw in a female.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that room looks sexy.
[SPEAKER_09]: What size box?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sevens?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sevens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sevens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice and organized.
[SPEAKER_09]: My room is sad right now because my
flowering room is totally empty.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because that fucking female killed
that motherfucker in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Murder.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just chopped it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hanging on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all upside down now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's anti-gravity weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty soon it'll be some great medicine
on some Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll heal a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Topsy turvy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just CannaVenture, have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you don't seem like an Instagram guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what, man?
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a Twitter account that I can't even
tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, somebody out there will find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody listening will Twitter you and
they'll be like, here it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty bad, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your phone will go trip, trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll be like, oh, that's my Twitter
account, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's getting bad when you can Google
your own name and that's in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like one jillion hits, you know,
different things pop up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I try not to look too much at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to tell these guys toward the
end of the show, how many people listen to
[SPEAKER_09]: this podcast?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do either of you have a guess how many
people hear my little show?
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I listen to your show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within 48 hours of the posting of on
iTunes and Stitcher, 5,000 people have
[SPEAKER_09]: heard this show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within a week, about 7,500 people will
hear this show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pro shit for real.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys walked in and they're like,
this is some pro shit, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some mics and a computer,
but I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are these for, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't it sound a lot better?
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds so pro, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love bullshitting with these guys,
but I should wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys only tend to listen to about 45
minutes and we're at 47.

[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get you all the information you need.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to turn down some music here and
we're going to get into a couple of
[SPEAKER_09]: things.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first thing I want to talk about is
Hitman Dougie posted a thing to Instagrams
[SPEAKER_09]: where I discovered this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a two page letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm pulling up the article while I
talk here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a two page letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was sent to all of the... I'm going to
say MED a lot here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The MED stands for Marijuana Enforcement
Division.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Marijuana Enforcement Division sent
this letter to every business in Colorado
[SPEAKER_09]: that is regulated and registered with the
Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[SPEAKER_09]: which includes every dispensary,
every edible manufacturing company,
[SPEAKER_09]: every extract making company.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just about anything involved in the
marijuana industry is covered by these
[SPEAKER_09]: guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're doing it legally, these guys are
in your shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they sent out a letter regarding the
cannabis cup to remind the businesses...
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to just kind of read it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says regarding licensee participation
in off-premise cannabis events,
[SPEAKER_09]: trade shows, and festivals.
[SPEAKER_09]: The letter says this, Dear Colorado
marijuana industry members, as the
[SPEAKER_09]: operator of a medical marijuana business
and or retail marijuana establishment,
[SPEAKER_09]: you hold a privileged license issued by
the state licensing authority.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your facility must be operated strictly
within the law set forth by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_09]: constitution, Colorado revised statutes,
and the Colorado code of regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Marijuana Enforcement Division,
which is the MED, is responsible for
[SPEAKER_09]: ensuring licensees fully comply with these
laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: While licensees may be aware of the legal
requirements on the license premises,
[SPEAKER_09]: high profile cannabis events, trades
shows, industry marketing, and festivals
[SPEAKER_09]: around the state generate a number of
inquiries to MED about what business or
[SPEAKER_09]: establishment related activity may be
permissible off the license premise.
[SPEAKER_09]: Typically, those inquiries focus on
whether an owner or their employee may
[SPEAKER_09]: transport medical marijuana or retail
marijuana flour or products from license
[SPEAKER_09]: premises to such events for marketing and
promotional purposes, for display,
[SPEAKER_09]: providing samples, competitions,
sales, or donations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Statute clearly mandates that marijuana
produced within regulated system must
[SPEAKER_09]: remain in the closed system and only
transported between MED license premises
[SPEAKER_09]: until final sale to a patient or customer
and may not be consumed within any
[SPEAKER_09]: licensed premises.
[SPEAKER_09]: No owner or employee may enjoy the
privileges provided by MED business
[SPEAKER_09]: license, the ability to lawfully cultivate
process and sell marijuana within the
[SPEAKER_09]: state of Colorado at any off-premise site.
[SPEAKER_09]: Medical or retail marijuana licensee
owners or employees should not use
[SPEAKER_09]: personally purchased flour or product as a
means to avoid the intent of the statute
[SPEAKER_09]: and regulation prohibiting off-premise
display and sale of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado statute and rule does not
preclude a MED licensee from participating
[SPEAKER_09]: at an event, trade show, or festival off
premises in order to distribute coupons,
[SPEAKER_09]: display graphics, or handout printed
material.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a two-page article.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to click back a couple pages to
find page two, because I just found this
[SPEAKER_09]: on Hitman Glass Dougie's Instagram,
so I'm reading a picture of this letter,
[SPEAKER_09]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to recap kind of what part of
this says.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying basically that... Oh,
that music is still playing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying that you can't take your
cannabis that was produced in a dispensary
[SPEAKER_09]: grow to these events and share it,
smoke it, consume it, and show it off at
[SPEAKER_09]: these events.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to stay in the confines of that
regulated building.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can't take that cannabis there,
which means the dispensaries, the large
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensaries that have paid a lot of money
for booths cannot go display their
[SPEAKER_09]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Typically, these booths would be smoking
you down with dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd be smoking you down with flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be a line.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would get to taste all of the major
dispensaries and Colorado's products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the MED is saying, no, you cannot do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have also said that they're going to
be there in force to enforce this,
[SPEAKER_09]: to make sure this happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not in this letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just the talk around this letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have verified, yes, we're not fucking
around.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're coming to kind of put some pressure
on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there's that short paragraph.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, that sounds like a lot of weirdness
if you don't catch on to what that says.
[SPEAKER_09]: That means that if a dispensary owner
knows a private grower, like myself,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a private grower.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a private caregiver grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: He cannot buy a pound of product from me
and put it in his dispensary display at
[SPEAKER_09]: the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: He cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should not use personally purchased flower
or product as a means to avoid the intent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they find product there,
they're going to be upset about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be in violation some way
because you're violating either the
[SPEAKER_09]: transportation law and taking it out of
the closed system that they have invented
[SPEAKER_09]: here, or you're going to be in violation
because you have now purchased some
[SPEAKER_09]: outside system cannabis and brought it
into the system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're definitely going to find a way
to screw us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me find page two.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm kind of stumbled into
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there was another paragraph on the end
of page one that I have to start with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's find that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, but in order to diminish the
potential for improper conduct at an event
[SPEAKER_09]: or festival, Colorado licensees are
strongly encouraged to locate any booth or
[SPEAKER_09]: exhibit table in an area away from and
separated from any area designated for
[SPEAKER_09]: consumption of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Similarly, licensees are encouraged to
avoid any participation in which the
[SPEAKER_09]: licensee might appear to be facilitating
potentially illegal conduct.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they know that there's going to be
consumption at some of these events.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're saying that they want you,
if you are an MED regulated business,
[SPEAKER_09]: you need to locate any booth or exhibit
table in any area away from and separated
[SPEAKER_09]: from any area designated for consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're pretty much saying,
get the fuck away from all the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff where people are smoking,
go far, far away from that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last I heard high times canceled the
medical portion of their party at the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis cup this year because they're
putting this pressure on it and they
[SPEAKER_09]: couldn't get enough medical entries is
what somebody told me is why they were
[SPEAKER_09]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: This kind of makes sense now.
[SPEAKER_09]: What they used to do was they would have a
special building designated just for the
[SPEAKER_09]: medical entries.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't seem like they're doing
that now, but I'm going to keep reading
[SPEAKER_09]: this.
[SPEAKER_09]: A pursuant to CRS 12-43.3-901.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys really want to hear all these
numbers?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is unlawful for a person to buy,
sell, transfer, give away, or acquire
[SPEAKER_09]: medical marijuana, retail marijuana,
or retail marijuana products except as
[SPEAKER_09]: allowed pursuant to these articles or
section 16 of article Roman numerals of
[SPEAKER_09]: the state constitution.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm trying to get past that part
quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Conduct outside of the protections of the
license and regulated market under CRS
[SPEAKER_09]: title 12 or authorized under amendments 20
or 64 may trigger criminal liability under
[SPEAKER_09]: CRS title 18 to include unlawful
dispensing, sale, and distribution of
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana or marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which means if you're there giving away
cannabis as a booth, they can arrest you
[SPEAKER_09]: for unlawful distribution of marijuana or
marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it continues to say, the MED will
continue to work with Colorado licensees
[SPEAKER_09]: to promote a strong and legitimate
regulatory framework for the Colorado
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: MED will hold both businesses and
individual marijuana licensees responsible
[SPEAKER_09]: for violations of state statutes and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Failure to abide by the statutes and
regulations may result in a range of
[SPEAKER_09]: sanctions up to including the suspension
and revocation of marijuana business or
[SPEAKER_09]: occupational licenses in addition to
possible criminal charges and penalties.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what they're saying there is,
everybody that works in an MED regulated
[SPEAKER_09]: facility has to have an MED badge,
which mine should be sitting on the table.
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little green badge.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got your picture on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got your name on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says marijuana enforcement
division.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there are three different colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are support badges, which are like
usually the tremors, the bud tenders and
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there are key badges,
which are like people to make decisions is
[SPEAKER_09]: basically how that goes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Managers, master growers, leaders,
seed growers, those guys are your key
[SPEAKER_09]: holder badges.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then above that is the owner badge.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are bright red.
[SPEAKER_09]: You only see those very rarely,
but they're saying that if you get caught
[SPEAKER_09]: doing something stupid at this event,
they will revoke not only the business
[SPEAKER_09]: license, but they're going to take away
the employee MED badge license,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is kind of sketchy too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So guys, if you're out there supporting a
dispenser, you got big balls and I got a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of respect for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't lose your business license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the letter ends with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any questions or suggestions,
please contact investigator Victor Ross,
[SPEAKER_09]: field enforcement section, Denver office
at, and then they give his email address
[SPEAKER_09]: and his phone number.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for your understanding,
support and cooperation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it looks like a three-year-old
signed the letter.
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently they're serious about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not messing around.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Hitman Glass Dougie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't know Dougie from Hitman
Glass, say what's up to him at the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give him a high five.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might put this episode out a couple of
days early just so that you can hear this
[SPEAKER_09]: before the cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is cup day here, but happy 420
anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dougie raises the question.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Colorado here, their goal was to
regulate alcohol or regulate cannabis like
[SPEAKER_09]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this does not seem like the fair way
to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when you go to any event in
Colorado, you see Coors everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Coors everywhere because we got a lot
of Coors breweries here, but you see
[SPEAKER_09]: Coors, you see Bud, you see Fat Tire.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see so many beer ads everywhere you go
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go to like the food festivals,
if you go to a football game, a baseball
[SPEAKER_09]: game, there are beer ads.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now what's wrong with having cannabis
people, cannabis businesses at cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: events.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're going to go do beer events where
we serve beer everywhere, it's just
[SPEAKER_09]: unfair.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not what we asked for.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not what we voted for.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to find a way.
[SPEAKER_09]: The big flaw in all the Colorado laws in
my opinion is that we can buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can possess cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have cannabis, but the only place
you're really allowed to consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: is in your own home.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only legal place in the privacy
or another person's home or in a private
[SPEAKER_09]: place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've tried to have events that we've
called private, but then once the cops
[SPEAKER_09]: show up, they call it public and we can't
have our dab events or smoke outs there
[SPEAKER_09]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the flaw in our law is having
some more legal to smoke and being able to
[SPEAKER_09]: have these booths come and bring their
wares and advertise heavily.
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of sucks that they're tracking
down.
[SPEAKER_09]: This year could set a precedent for how
the cups are going to go in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: They may change things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it goes well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, if you're going to the cannabis cup,
be safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put this episode out a couple
of days early is what I feel like I need
[SPEAKER_09]: to do so that you guys can hear this,
but please be safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please be safe at the cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if you're at the cup, find me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a six foot five white guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got dreadlocks to my ass region,
kind of past my ass, kind of thigh region.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wearing an iRegenetics t-shirt or
hoodie most likely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got a grassroots hat on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crooked.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm easy to find it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a smiley white guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm goofy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, find me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Say what's up to me at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about the 420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where can you guys find me?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys want to hang out, take a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to smoke a joint with me,
smoke a bowl with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday night, the 15th, I will be at
Cervantes in Denver, checking out a band
[SPEAKER_09]: called Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely one of my favorite reggae
bands.
[SPEAKER_09]: I live 125 miles from that concert.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going by myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to dab me out before,
hit me up, email me, Facebook me,
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram me something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: GFYH, add GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just find Grow From Your Heart on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, I'm down to dab with you or
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have some time to kill.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go up there early.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're somewhere near Cervantes,
I'm not sure which Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are several Cervantes venues.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to look at my ticket and see which
one it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're somewhere near one of the
Cervantes and want to dab me out on
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday, I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thursday, I'll be up in Colorado Springs
seeing Hydro.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend Hydro performs some pretty dope
ass hip hop rap style stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really positive dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go dab him out in Colorado
Springs on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Friday, I'm packing up, taking care of the
plants real good, getting them all happy,
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure everything at home is cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Friday night, heading up to Denver
for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got to go get in my hotel room Friday
night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, if you're in Denver Friday
night, you want to take some dabs,
[SPEAKER_09]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_09]: We will get down on all of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this episode is going to have to
come out like Wednesday or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll just do another episode for
420.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I think we'll do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I told you Wednesday, I told you
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Friday, I'm packing up, heading up to the
cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: Saturday, I'm getting up early and heading
to the cannabis cup as soon as I wake up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just going to take a shower, get some
food, go to the cup and rage it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Saturday night, I don't have any plans at
the cannabis cup or after the cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you got something going on Saturday
night, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunday, same deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get up, head to the cannabis
cup, go have fun, go see all my friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to shake everybody's hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: So find me there Sunday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday is going to be a big day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday, I might get to the cup a little
bit late.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might sleep in a little bit because I've
got a long night.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at 9.45, I've got VIP tickets to
see Doug Benson record a new comedy
[SPEAKER_09]: special at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will definitely be there a little bit
early.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's usually a smokeout with Doug
before or after the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell you if that'll happen
publicly or privately, but I will
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely get Doug nice and blazed for
his recording.
[SPEAKER_09]: After Doug Benson, depending on how late
it is and how I'm feeling, I might venture
[SPEAKER_09]: over to Cervantes or maybe it's Coyotes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll find out for sure by the time the
show comes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Lee Scratch Perry with special guests
will be at a club in Denver.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I've got the energy, I'm going to
head over to that and see what's going on
[SPEAKER_09]: and check out some more reggae.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'm going to drive home.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to drive 125 or 130-ish miles about
two hours back home, take care of the
[SPEAKER_09]: garden, make sure nothing went crazy at a
couple of spots.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to check on some plants on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Tuesday, I think I'm heading back up
to Denver, have lunch with somebody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I got to come back to the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Wednesday is going to be,
I got a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go see Greg Proops at the
ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to wrap up my 420
celebration week, unless something cool is
[SPEAKER_09]: happening Thursday or Friday.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're rolling deep already,
so I got to quit making plans.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're putting a big bite in the wallet,
but it's worth it, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 420 weekend and we're going all out.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you see me at one of those places,
you want to join me at one of those
[SPEAKER_09]: places, you want to hang out before or
after something like that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also at the Cannabis Cup, a few of my
friends have booths.
[SPEAKER_09]: Garden of Weedon and the Smokers Club have
a booth.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friends with Sour Seeds have a booth.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of my homies have booths
and I will be hanging out at those booths,
[SPEAKER_09]: just kicking it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I'll have, I may have a couple
of t-shirts in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really want to lug them around,
but I may have some t-shirts with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't have any seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sold out of seeds, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good thing for me, terrible thing
for you, but nature's green remedies and
[SPEAKER_09]: all the locals clean me the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll be at those booths.
[SPEAKER_09]: I may do a little speaking.
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody has questions or something,
you can ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like seriously, I'm just some dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk up, shake my hand, introduce
yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may make a friend for life.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of a shy guy myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, you might not really believe
that, but there's nobody here right now,
[SPEAKER_09]: so I could talk into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_09]: People freak me out, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my plan for the Cannabis Cup
weekend.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to this email that a friend of
mine sent.
[SPEAKER_09]: FastBerry sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got so many emails here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I know this is kind of late.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sent me this on April 5th,
but I haven't recorded a show since,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, I had CannaVenture over,
but I know, my recording schedule is
[SPEAKER_09]: hectic and getting the episodes out once a
week kind of puts you behind on this,
[SPEAKER_09]: but FastBerry at gmail.com sent me this
email.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Rhode Island needs some help.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, I'm at FastBerry from
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a problem in Rhode Island with the
caregivers program.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could read this and put the word
out about connecting local government for
[SPEAKER_09]: anyone or about contacting local
government for anyone who listens,
[SPEAKER_09]: the community would be grateful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are in Rhode Island,
FastBerry needs your help.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there's some shit happening
with the medical marijuana caregivers
[SPEAKER_09]: program in Rhode Island and we need your
support.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in Rhode Island, go to this
email or go to this website.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Http, okay, go to ripatients.org,
you guys, ripatients.org slash index.html.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where most of the information is
organized and accessible is what FastBerry
[SPEAKER_09]: says.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also make sure you follow FastBerry on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell him that you heard about him through
the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give him a little bump on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make him smile.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you got to do what you can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to click on the link here and
see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys are in Rhode Island,
that's part of your job to go there and
[SPEAKER_09]: contact your local Congress people and let
them know that you don't like the bullshit
[SPEAKER_09]: they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill seeks to eliminate caregivers.
[SPEAKER_09]: A new Senate bill would eliminate the
caregiver to create for-profit entities
[SPEAKER_09]: that will grow and sell cannabis to the
compassion.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, fuck that, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, I'm going to contact these
people and tell them that that's bullshit
[SPEAKER_09]: because that's kind of what happened here
in Colorado indirectly.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got rid of the caregiver model.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got rid of the patients and now it's
just commercial ized cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_09]: medical patients that need quality herb
are not getting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel that they're the ones that
started this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you guys in Rhode Island, don't let
this shit happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't let that happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: FastBerry, thanks for getting my attention
on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do what I can, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a call to action.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't ask you guys to do a lot of shit,
but get on there and help FastBerry with
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's next on the agenda here?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys want to do a really short
episode?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's read like one or two news articles
and then just get this shit out of here,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some news articles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are going to like this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some frosty cold root beer just
staring at me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's delicious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this article says Colorado's record
pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, let me read that again.
[SPEAKER_09]: That big drink made me fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of being stupid, I'm going to
rant here for a minute again.
[SPEAKER_09]: About 16 days ago, I got a major
concussion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was about 16 days ago,
so I can't even count.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize, but I hit my head twice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you guys I hit my head,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hit my head, but then I fell down
some stairs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the bottom of the stairs,
I hit my head again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just found on the back of my head a
few days ago, I found a nice well on the
[SPEAKER_09]: back there too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a lot more fucked up than I
realized, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I recorded two podcasts with Mike and Adam
that are fuzzy to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of that stuff, that guy talking,
wasn't completely Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of my subconscious doing its
weird shit on those.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it was kind of getting my shit
back together, but there are moments in
[SPEAKER_09]: that podcast where I don't know what the
fuck was going on, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope the shows have been all right,
but I'm kind of feeling like I'm getting
[SPEAKER_09]: back together.
[SPEAKER_09]: My brain is kind of unscrambling itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I forget dumb stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when I leave my house, if I'm going
to certain people's houses, I have to
[SPEAKER_09]: think about when I pull out of the
driveway, which way should I go?
[SPEAKER_09]: It used to be subconscious.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to this guy's house,
you turn left.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to his, you turn right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I have to kind of think about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you going, bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're going to his house.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should go left.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that shit's coming back, honestly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all coming back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every doctor says that it just takes time.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you see me at the cannabis cup and you
want to dab me out, please don't give me a
[SPEAKER_09]: half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need little dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still healing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The dabs make my temperature go crazy and
it makes my wound on my head throb a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't dab me out too hard, but little
dabs are cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take little dabs all day, but yeah,
I know that was fucking random,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: This article says, Colorado's record
February pot sales yield $2.1 million for
[SPEAKER_09]: schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pot sales, $2.1 million for schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that great?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're selling cannabis and it's paying for
school.
[SPEAKER_09]: People never thought that would happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to read you the article.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is by Ricardo Baca from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says, Colorado sold a record amount
of recreational marijuana in February,
[SPEAKER_09]: 2015, according to new data released by
the state on Friday, around $39.2 million
[SPEAKER_09]: of recreational cannabis was sold in state
shops in February, according to
[SPEAKER_09]: calculations based on data provided by the
Colorado Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_09]: The previous monthly record for
recreational sales was January 2015,
[SPEAKER_09]: $36.4 million.
[SPEAKER_09]: Much of that growth comes, excuse me,
I'm burping from the root beer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm back on track.
[SPEAKER_09]: Much of that growth comes from additional
shops opening up and still new
[SPEAKER_09]: recreational cities, including Aurora,
Colorado's third most populous city that
[SPEAKER_09]: only started selling retail pot last
October, experts say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, these guys are rolling.
[SPEAKER_09]: The activity in Aurora has helped boost
those sales and tax numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are also getting more
comfortable with purchasing legally,
[SPEAKER_09]: knowing that it's available and becoming a
bit more mainstream.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's helping sales too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which guys, people were afraid to go into
the stores and buy recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: for some reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: People were afraid of medical cannabis for
a long time, but it seems like people are
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of getting excited about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, there was one group of people that
were dispensary connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew everything about the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some people just seem kind of anxious
to get in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the article goes on to say,
and anything that helps legal sales helps
[SPEAKER_09]: erode the black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado's total medical marijuana sales
in February 2015 added up to about $29.3
[SPEAKER_09]: million, up more than $1 million from the
previous month.
[SPEAKER_09]: The record for medical marijuana sales in
Colorado's recreational era, which started
[SPEAKER_09]: January 1st, 2014, came in February of
2014 when $36 million in medical pot was
[SPEAKER_09]: sold.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another important indicator in Colorado's
complex pot sales, a complete pot,
[SPEAKER_09]: fuck, that's a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another important indicator in Colorado's
complex pot taxes is the amount dedicated
[SPEAKER_09]: for public schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that monthly total was more than $2
million for the second consecutive month
[SPEAKER_09]: in February.
[SPEAKER_09]: In January, the excise tax on wholesale
marijuana transfers raised more than $2.3
[SPEAKER_09]: million for schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in February, it totaled $2.1 million.
[SPEAKER_09]: The monthly excise taxes earmarked for
school construction capital never topped
[SPEAKER_09]: $2 million in 2014, the first year of
recreational pot sales in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2014, Colorado sold nearly $700 million
a pot, $385.9 million for medical
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana, and $313.2 million for
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Projections based on the first two months
of 2015's recreational and medical numbers
[SPEAKER_09]: suggest that Colorado will sell more
marijuana and collect more in pot-related
[SPEAKER_09]: taxes in 2015.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it did in 2014.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I can support that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the grower at the spot now and we're
still working on the grows and getting
[SPEAKER_09]: everything in place, but I'm there often
in meetings and talking about where to put
[SPEAKER_09]: this and how to do that and where we're
going to do everything and who's going to
[SPEAKER_09]: do what.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I'm there, I see the sales
happening and they are getting busier than
[SPEAKER_09]: ever, busier than ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also hang out with my good friends
at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see those guys getting busier than
ever.
[SPEAKER_09]: So more and more people are buying
cannabis and there are more shops popping
[SPEAKER_09]: up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with more shops popping up around us
and the spot staying as busy as it is,
[SPEAKER_09]: that tells me that all those other shops
have to be selling stuff too, because
[SPEAKER_09]: people go check out new places.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like a lot of the people that
come from out of state, they know they can
[SPEAKER_09]: only buy seven grams at one shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they probably go visit several shops.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my area, there are a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have lost count how many are out in
Pueblo West right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the shops are getting busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're staying busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only going to get busier.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're only going to bring in more money
for the schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have actually fixed a bunch of
potholes in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if that was related to
any cannabis money or not, but man,
[SPEAKER_09]: it was about time they fixed that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do I got for you in the news
world?
[SPEAKER_09]: Read a couple more articles and then we're
going to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of a great article.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this guy was a freaking genius.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's from The Cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says,
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to say his name right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I got that right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't I say pizza?
[SPEAKER_09]: I love pizza.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sexy pizza, which is three locations in
central Denver neighborhoods, by affixing
[SPEAKER_09]: campaign flyers to pizza boxes before
they're sent out to customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Calabari says he printed 5,000 campaign
flyers for the boxes, enough to last about
[SPEAKER_09]: two weeks at the pizza shops.
[SPEAKER_09]: The piece pictures Calabari under the
words, I'm a real person.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's running against four others for two
at-large seats in the May 5th election.
[SPEAKER_09]: In cubments, Debbie Ortega and Robin
Kniech are fellow challengers,
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Sylvia and Jeffrey Washington.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and fellow challengers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I read that word wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And fellow challengers, Joe Sylvia and
Jeffrey Washington.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, Calabari, excuse me, I got to take
a drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: My throat's all clogged up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go for some water this time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that root beer is what clogged me.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's better.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, Calabari, who also co-owns Denver
Relief, the city's oldest marijuana
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary, has raised some eyebrows among
fellow candidates by missing candidate
[SPEAKER_09]: forums, though he says he had conflicts
and plans to begin participating in some
[SPEAKER_09]: upcoming events.
[SPEAKER_09]: His pizza box flyers are unorthodox
campaigning, where it gets a little
[SPEAKER_09]: squishy is that under Denver election
code, Calabari must report sexy pizzas
[SPEAKER_09]: seeding of the cardboard real estate and
arguably the delivery service as an
[SPEAKER_09]: in-kind contribution.
[SPEAKER_09]: He says he plans to do so, but it's
unclear what that's worth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Denver leaves it up to candidates to
assign a fair market value that's
[SPEAKER_09]: reasonable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Calabari says he's mulling that over and
will probably rate the value at a penny or
[SPEAKER_09]: two per flyer or $50 to $100 total on his
next campaign finance report.
[SPEAKER_09]: He says that's reasonable because he's
used sexy pizzas boxes to promote his
[SPEAKER_09]: other businesses, including Denver Relief
and Sexbot comedy shows, as well as
[SPEAKER_09]: partners events at no charge.
[SPEAKER_09]: He pointed out that his campaign
volunteers, not sexy pizzas employees,
[SPEAKER_09]: are attaching the flyers to the boxes in
advance.
[SPEAKER_09]: So technically, he's not really using the
pizza shop employees, he's using his own
[SPEAKER_09]: guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's not using the pizza shop as like
slave labor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's political crap you have to
worry about.
[SPEAKER_09]: So perhaps it was inevitable that Calabari
would attempt such synergy in his run for
[SPEAKER_09]: Denver City Council.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is after all the same guy who tried
to make a point and mocked governor John
[SPEAKER_09]: Hickenlooper, a former beer brewer who
opposed pot legalization by following him
[SPEAKER_09]: around in a chicken suit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a picture of this dude in a
chicken suit smoking a spliff on a couch,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it says, but his mailers strike a
more serious tone, highlighting Calabari's
[SPEAKER_09]: business experiences as an entrepreneur
who started or helped start several local
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses and making the claim,
I have more business experience than all
[SPEAKER_09]: current city council members combined.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's careful to mention his ownership of
the marijuana shop in passing,
[SPEAKER_09]: below his support for LGBT and
transgendered rights and his position as
[SPEAKER_09]: an opponent of greedy developers.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's drawn more serious fundraising
support lately, out raising the other four
[SPEAKER_09]: candidates in March by collecting $22,383.
[SPEAKER_09]: Though he still trails the incumbent's
overall totals significantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: This article is written weird right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is hard to say if he's rounding up
enough support to threaten Ortega or
[SPEAKER_09]: Knitsch on May 5th, but Calabari always
exudes confidence.
[SPEAKER_09]: He noted that the pizza box flyers amount
to a fraction of his efforts.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to end up doing right around
70,000 mailers, he said.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to go to various
demographics and we're making a couple
[SPEAKER_09]: thousand phone calls.
[SPEAKER_09]: The social media is really what I'm
getting a kick out of right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this article was first published on the
denverpost.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great that this guy who is
part owner of a dispensary owns a pizza
[SPEAKER_09]: joint and is running for office in Denver
is attaching his flyers to pizza boxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're hitting your target audience.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about the throat clearing and
the funky voice here.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys want to come talk on the
podcast, you'd be across the table from me
[SPEAKER_09]: so that I don't have to talk to the wall.
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't have to hear me clear my throat
so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love you on the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me what you want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll bring you on.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to be some elitist or
anybody too crazy to get on this show.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you're not crazy, we'll bring
you on.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to read one more article.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long have we been recording?
[SPEAKER_09]: Come here, GarageBand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show me, show me.
[SPEAKER_09]: 32 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If this article is short, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's too long, we're going to skip it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's long.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we're going to do this
article.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's too long.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just skip it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about this one on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next episode, we're going to do an
article.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll read an article about a special
report, edible safety, still a concern for
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll read that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The next episode will probably actually
come out on 420.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be a really long episode
either, but the one after that will be my
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis cup review episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: The episode after that, we are going to
talk about planning your gardens,
[SPEAKER_09]: getting the schedule for your garden
figured out so that you could be as
[SPEAKER_09]: productive as you can be so that you're
not behind, so that you're not ahead,
[SPEAKER_09]: so that you're not missing clones when you
need them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I plan to get Jesse over to do more
outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse is a busy man lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing his own outdoor stuff,
so we got to bear with him.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get Mike over to talk about some
politics pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a couple of more guests in mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cannabis cup is coming, so you never
know what could happen at the cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: We may talk to some people while we're
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do I need to talk about in this
meeting or in this episode?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just saw the word meeting on my note
paper, so we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a growers meeting, April 26th.
[SPEAKER_09]: That high-growth indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were in Pueblo, Colorado or the
surrounding area, it would be worth your
[SPEAKER_09]: time to come hang out with us at
high-growth indoor growing supplies at 618
[SPEAKER_09]: East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend Jesse has some things he wants
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he doesn't take the whole time,
I plan to talk about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably repeat a little bit of the
garden planning stuff that I plan on doing
[SPEAKER_09]: for the podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm writing it out for the class and the
episode is one thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get that info out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else should we talk about?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's close up the show and I will see you
guys in a few days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, guys, if you see me at any of
these events coming up over the next week,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a tall white guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably there's going to be a lot of
those there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not the guy with dreadlocks in my
beard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have dreads in my beard.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's cool too.
[SPEAKER_09]: High five him.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want to come up and meet me,
introduce yourself, I'm not shy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to be your friend, so come say
what's up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am kind of shy, but I'm not shy to be
your friend.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not shy to meet you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not shy to say hi to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come be my friend, say what's up to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to wrap up the show here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do we want to say?

[SPEAKER_09]: So, I got a really cool email or a
Facebook message from somebody the other
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's that message?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to read this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say your name on the show
because you didn't say if you wanted me to
[SPEAKER_09]: or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sent me a personal message and I'm
going to read it out loud.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Rasta Jeff, big fan of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I recently finished binge listening to the
whole back catalog and enjoyed every
[SPEAKER_09]: episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm somewhat disappointed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I now have to go days between episodes,
but I'm sure I'll cope.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've learned a lot from the Grow Lessons
with you, Jesse and Spence.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to have a lighthouse in the sea
of bullshit that is the internet forums.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I'm glad you pointed that out
because that's part of what inspired me to
[SPEAKER_09]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to write a book originally,
but I'm too scatterbrained to write a damn
[SPEAKER_09]: book.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we did a podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of my goal was to dispel a bunch
of the bullshit that we see on the
[SPEAKER_09]: internet and in the forums.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm glad you realized that that's what
we're out and trying to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, then he goes on to say, I was halfway
through vegging a half dozen plants in
[SPEAKER_09]: bubble buckets when I started listening to
the GFYH.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was to say, I have seen the light and
I'm gearing up to switch to soil for the
[SPEAKER_09]: next run.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have planned with hopes of soon
becoming fully organic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, don't worry about jumping in fully
organic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do what you can to get rid of those
buckets and start learning how to work
[SPEAKER_09]: soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Read a few books, read the TLO book like
Sean and I were talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll definitely get you started.
[SPEAKER_09]: Read teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll get you a good start.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't try to be too hardcore about going
fully organic right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Learn how to grow and adjust solely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just want you to get there when
you're ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then he goes on to say, I would like to
gain some more insight and perspective
[SPEAKER_09]: from you on indoor soil setups.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've mentioned you hand water plants
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this consist of literally pouring the
water to each plant or some other system I
[SPEAKER_09]: am misunderstanding?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he goes on and says, thank you
for your time and effort.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking forward to getting my hands on
some irie genetics as soon as they hit
[SPEAKER_09]: NGR.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go with that first paragraph there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hand watering.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I mix my, so I run, my personal
caregiver grows our soil grows.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will mix my nutrients into a large
container.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, my big batches are mixed up in a
Rubbermaid trash can.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how much I mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got a mark where it's 25 gallons.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mix up a 25 gallon batch.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm using organics, you can't fuck with
the pH too much.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to accept what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're using synthetic nutrients,
go ahead and fix your pH.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use a one gallon pitcher, just like
you'd get at Target or wherever else
[SPEAKER_09]: you're shopping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Target.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just stick the pitcher right in there and
pour it right into the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: That way I have a good gauge of how much
I'm putting into each plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can say this plant prefers a half a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_09]: This plant prefers a whole gallon.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can kind of measure that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I'm actually hand watering just
by using a pitcher and dumping it into the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I run seven gallon pots are my favorites
to use and each seven gallon pot takes a
[SPEAKER_09]: gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a perfect mathematical equation to
know how many gallons you need.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's easy for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So never a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, dude, thanks for the huge
compliments.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say your name.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for listening to every episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to prevent the, what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_09]: The withdrawals by doing episodes more
often, but I don't want to burn you out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I save materials.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that I have something worth a shit so
that I don't just show up and give you a
[SPEAKER_09]: crappy show.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if I've got two shows worth of
material in a week, I definitely kick them
[SPEAKER_09]: out for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the message.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys want to send me a message on
Facebook, I would definitely appreciate
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Read it out loud for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk a little bit about what I
did this week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last night, well actually I'm recording at
one in the morning on the, what's the date
[SPEAKER_09]: right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the 17th.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was the 16th.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the night of the 16th.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's turning into the 17th.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the night before last, I guess we'll
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the honor to go see one of my
favorite reggae bands in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to go see Morgan Heritage at
Cervantes Other Side in Denver,
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove the two hour drive by myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are like, dude,
you drive up there by yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I listened to a podcast, take a couple
dabs before I leave.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a great trip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you get there, you get to a
reggae show and I'm a white guy with
[SPEAKER_09]: dreadlocks to my butt.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the reggae scene knows me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there for 10 minutes by myself
before I made friends and bumped into
[SPEAKER_09]: people that I already knew.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was not even going by myself really.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Morgan Heritage came out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that band tore it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Morgan Heritage is on fire right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're into reggae, if you like good
harmonies, if you want to see a killer
[SPEAKER_09]: live reggae show, I fully, fully recommend
you go check out Morgan Heritage while
[SPEAKER_09]: they're on tour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their set list right now is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great mix from all their albums.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did pretty much, if I made a Morgan
Heritage playlist, they would have played
[SPEAKER_09]: it last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a big shout out to Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big shout out to Cervantes Other Side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also a big shout out to Carlos and his
crews.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good hanging out with you guys made me
feel like I was at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's where my night got really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I walked out of the venue from seeing the
concert and the band was kind of gathering
[SPEAKER_09]: up by their tour bus across the street.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I couldn't see them because the tour
bus is long and they're on the other side.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I walked to the corner where I could
just casually lean against a parking meter
[SPEAKER_09]: and stare into the Denver skyline and kind
of see the band hanging out by their tour
[SPEAKER_09]: bus, doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to bug them, but I kind of
just wanted to observe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a nice night.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cold, but it was nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: After being in the concert, it was nice to
get some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm standing on the corner and the
light turns red and a car stops in front
[SPEAKER_09]: of me, a car stops in the far lane.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a car stops behind that car and
rolls down the window and the guy in the
[SPEAKER_09]: driver's seat yells, hey, fuck you,
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just standing on the corner in
downtown Denver by myself at five points,
[SPEAKER_09]: like two in the morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think to myself, this is about to
get sketchy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I reached into my pockets to see what
I've got.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a little bit of dabs in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my cell phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my keys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have anything that's going
to help me out in this position.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had money in my pocket and I had my
weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much all they were going to do is
kick my ass and take my weed and money is
[SPEAKER_09]: what I was assuming.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I tried to ignore them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I thought being an
ostrich would help.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just ignore them and they'll go away,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But the dude rolled down his window a
little further and he yelled another
[SPEAKER_09]: derogatory term about white guys with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't what I was worried about,
but I could look into the car and see that
[SPEAKER_09]: it was full.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were at least four, five,
maybe six people in that car and they were
[SPEAKER_09]: talking mad shit to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the dude said, fuck you, Rasta,
hardly salace I, is what he said to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was when I was like, this guy
knows what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_09]: He knows I'm a Rasta man and he's got
hatred specifically for Rastafarians,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially white Rastas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm all by myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I looked down the block to the right
and the concert venue was a good half a
[SPEAKER_09]: block away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked down to the left and there's
nothing but fucking darkness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I look forward and there's a coffee
shop that's closed as shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's me and this carload of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they pulled up to the curb and rolled
down their window.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was fucking Chris Kossis from The
Source Genetics, dude, just picking on me.
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I was like, not sure if I was about
to fight six people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if I was about to run down an
alley and get chased.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Turns out it's some of my damn friends
that just flew in from California and
[SPEAKER_09]: we're looking for a spot to hang out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, nerve wracking, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was shit in my pants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I run up to the car and give him a hug.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, dude, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, no, I can tell by the look
on your face.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the guy riding passenger seat was
like, why are you picking on this man?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: The passenger had no idea who I was.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Chris is like, dude, we're going to a
speakeasy that happens to be just several
[SPEAKER_09]: feet to the left of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk up the street, we'll park and we'll
meet up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they find a parking spot and they get
out of the car and they all give me hugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a chick whose name I can never
remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think her name is Daniella.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, maybe, possibly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I forgot your name again,
sweetie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Casas, Jibs, a dude named Mike,
and another dude whose name I forgot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might've been high as shit, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: But so we walked down the street and I
can't disclose the location of this place,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we walked down the street half a block
and there was a brown door that just
[SPEAKER_09]: looked like a normal door.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no, there was not an identifying
marker on the building, on the door,
[SPEAKER_09]: on anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my friends knocks on the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: A man opens some blinds and sees us,
opens the door, lets us into a small
[SPEAKER_09]: waiting area.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say anything, I wasn't quite sure
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just a new guy that just tagged
along.
[SPEAKER_09]: They invited me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, hands the guy at the door,
50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy shakes his hand and says,
all of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so another guy comes and leads us to a
little further down the way and gives us a
[SPEAKER_09]: little seating area and we all sit down.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure what's going on really.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was told that we're going to this little
speakeasy, but it was two in the morning
[SPEAKER_09]: and they were serving drinks in this
joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we sat down and I rolled, I had some
flowers on me from the concert that I had
[SPEAKER_09]: just been to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I rolled a nice size joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Casas rolled a nice size joint and my
buddy Jibs started taking dabs of solvent
[SPEAKER_09]: lists like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: My buddy Mike was to the right of me.
[SPEAKER_09]: He started taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dabs start going around, the joints are
going around and nobody seemed to care.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were the only ones puffing in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Casas pointed out that it may have been a
gay bar.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that there were some gay folk in
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what qualifies it as a gay
bar, but it had definitely a different
[SPEAKER_09]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a shit ton of fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a pool table in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't shoot pool, but people were
shooting pool, having fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were serving drinks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I stayed there until 4.20 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never would have discovered that if
Casas didn't scare the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, if you're listening to this,
bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I was going to have to fight six
people that night after a reggae show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had the best reggae cleansing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was feeling so good after that show and
then I thought I was going to have to
[SPEAKER_09]: fight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, my vibe totally changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't do that to your friends,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Chris, don't ever change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do that shit to your friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love you for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Casas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Jibs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to the whole crew in that car.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to the speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't cost me a dollar to hang out and
get lit in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were super kind.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody was cool to us in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciated that place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm in the area, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what else do we want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_09]: So tonight, so I came home from the
speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove home.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was starting to snow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fucking April in Colorado,
snowing, snowing, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was windy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pushing my car sideways down I-25.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got home about six in the morning,
a little after six, took a few dabs,
[SPEAKER_09]: slept, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: I slept most of today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I woke up, got a little bit more
prepared for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I drove up to Colorado Springs to
see my buddy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played Hydro songs on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_09]: He does the secret cup anthem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Hydro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Pacifier.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I say it like Pacifier,
it's Pass-a-fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I said Pacifier like a baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking Pacifier.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny when you say it that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Fortunate Youth at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of friends with Hydro.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I brought a bunch of pretty high
quality concentrates with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he, that dude travels.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been on tour with an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got an e-nail in the tour van.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he took me on stage at the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just started dabbing, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I noticed there's like six or eight,
seven or 10 people that want to come
[SPEAKER_09]: around and take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I dab all these guys out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: They appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all super kind.
[SPEAKER_09]: We get dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we go back upstairs from the
Black Sheep and this band walks out and
[SPEAKER_09]: starts playing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realized that's all the people that
I just dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was totally dabbing out all the
bands.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Hyri also.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to, a super huge shout out to
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Pacifier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Fortunate Youth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a shout out to Hyri.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got those guys high as shit tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys enjoyed my concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a lot of compliments on the Black
Cherry Cam.
[SPEAKER_09]: So big ups to all the reggae bands.
[SPEAKER_09]: My week is off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll brag more about my Cannabis Cup
weekend on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough of me rambling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about some news articles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you guys want to start?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to start on the serious shit?
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, last week I told you we were
going to talk about this Edibles report
[SPEAKER_09]: and I skipped it because it was way too
long.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_09]: This article is from The Cannabis and it's
by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_09]: The headline says, special report,
15 months in, Edibles still a safety
[SPEAKER_09]: concern for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a quick drink of some
root beer here and then we'll read the
[SPEAKER_09]: article.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, a year of debate, a slew of
labeling regulations and multiple
[SPEAKER_09]: educational campaigns have not been
effective in answering a critical question
[SPEAKER_09]: surrounding marijuana infused edible
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you stop a consumer from eating too
much?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I like the way this is written.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all like super impactive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once thought to be the simple entry for
those who wanted to try the newly
[SPEAKER_09]: legalized recreational drug have been
implicated in two suicides and one murder
[SPEAKER_09]: in the past 13 months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only one edibles related death has been
confirmed by officials, but the family of
[SPEAKER_09]: 22 year old Oklahoma tourist, Luke
Goodman, who fatally shot himself while on
[SPEAKER_09]: a March ski vacation in Keystone
immediately blamed his death on the
[SPEAKER_09]: infused edibles he overindulged in that
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 100% the drugs, Kim Goldman said at
the time, acknowledging that her son
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't read the government mandated
warnings on the packaging and ended up
[SPEAKER_09]: eating five times the state's recommended
dose for edible cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the recommended dose?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it 25, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means he ate 125 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ate a hundred milligram, a cloddy bear
the other night and I was high.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if this dude doesn't do any cannabis
consumption until this point and he eats a
[SPEAKER_09]: hundred milligrams, he was probably pretty
fucking high.
[SPEAKER_09]: To tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then it goes on to say much of the
regulatory debate around edibles has
[SPEAKER_09]: focused on preventing accidental
ingestion, but the manner in which edibles
[SPEAKER_09]: affected person raises the question
whether more should be done to educate
[SPEAKER_09]: buyers before they leave the shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a learning curve for consumers of
edibles said Art Wei, Colorado state
[SPEAKER_09]: director of Prolegalization Drug Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_09]: We cannot escape the issue of personal
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_09]: That said, the industry should do all that
is reasonable in the formative years of
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana legalization to combat concerns
around edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nearly 5 million edibles were sold in
Colorado shops in 2014.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only are edibles high, okay,
I'm going to try that sentence again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only are edibles high is more delayed
and long lasting than smoking or
[SPEAKER_09]: vaporizing cannabis, but some brands
continue to severely mismeasure their
[SPEAKER_09]: products potency.
[SPEAKER_09]: According to a new Denver post commission
series of lab tests measuring THC's in 10
[SPEAKER_09]: popular edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys, you'll remember we did a
report on that way in the infancy of this
[SPEAKER_09]: show.
[SPEAKER_09]: A bunch of the companies were making
edibles, a random person bought them and
[SPEAKER_09]: took them to Steep Hill Labs and things
that were claiming to have 100 milligrams
[SPEAKER_09]: were having 10 and then also maybe 200.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was way off the chart.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's hard to even say what some of
these people ate when they got all fucked
[SPEAKER_09]: up and did stupid stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where was I in the article?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Earlier this year, it seemed as if the
state's legislative pot docket had calmed
[SPEAKER_09]: down after a bustling 2014 of regulations
and rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_09]: For edibles alone, warning labels already
had been standardized with more
[SPEAKER_09]: information.
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 milligram doses of THC universally had
become individually wrapped.
[SPEAKER_09]: The state was working on uniform lab
testing standards and users encountered
[SPEAKER_09]: educational campaigns at every turn,
movie theaters, pot shops and interstate
[SPEAKER_09]: billboards.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that when you're buying edibles,
I think you should be given a pamphlet or
[SPEAKER_09]: something would be a good start because
I've been to a hundred dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work at a dispensary and the budtender
will say, hey, this is serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take this seriously.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the people don't respect it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think maybe if you gave them a
little paper so that they could read it,
[SPEAKER_09]: most of them are going to throw it away,
but at least we gave them that paper and
[SPEAKER_09]: gave them the opportunity to read it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when people talk, it's easy just
to ignore us when we're at the shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're looking at all the buds.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're looking at all the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're thinking about how much money you
can spend.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: The money comes flying out of your pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: You put the edibles right in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even think.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if we gave you a little piece
of paper to read and kind of showed you
[SPEAKER_09]: some shit, that might be a good start.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe make you sign something,
but then people don't even want to fuck
[SPEAKER_09]: around if you have to sign something at
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the first time I bought a
decadose chibichu.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was when they first, first came out.
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend had a shop and he invited me to
get a decadose and they made me sign a
[SPEAKER_09]: waiver to eat a decadose chibichu.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought it and they actually made me eat
it there because they didn't want me to
[SPEAKER_09]: give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: They told me to eat it there and I ate the
whole thing in front of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'm going to go on with the
article here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, in the wake of Goldman's death,
many recalled 19 year old Wyoming college
[SPEAKER_09]: student, Levi Tamba, who became agitated
after eating a infused cookie with more
[SPEAKER_09]: than six times the state's recommended
dose in March, 2014 and leapt to his death
[SPEAKER_09]: from a Denver hotel balcony.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Denver coroner listed medical
intoxication as a significant condition
[SPEAKER_09]: contributing to Tamba's death.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've ever been so high, you wanted to
jump off the balcony.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucking high.
[SPEAKER_09]: As the Summit County coroner awaits
Goodman's toxicology reports in the coming
[SPEAKER_09]: weeks, his death be related to cannabis or
not.
[SPEAKER_09]: As we continue down this road,
we really need to keep an open mind,
[SPEAKER_09]: said Louis Koski, director of Colorado's
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to continue to say medical
marijuana enforcement division on accident
[SPEAKER_09]: because that's what it started off as I
think.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to consider various incidents that
occur and work on putting them into
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective, as in what things do we as
regulators have control over to making
[SPEAKER_09]: things more efficient?
[SPEAKER_09]: Koski looked to the Edibles work group
that met four times in 2014 to discuss
[SPEAKER_09]: making Edibles clearly identifiable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Improving and simplifying the labels on
Edibles, reminding consumers that a single
[SPEAKER_09]: dose is 10 milligrams and to wait one to
two hours to feel the effect before
[SPEAKER_09]: ingesting more was discussed by the work
group, which included state officials,
[SPEAKER_09]: pot shop owners, representatives from
Edibles kitchens and children's health
[SPEAKER_09]: advocates.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too much, too fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: The new rules are due January 1st,
but while these regulations might help
[SPEAKER_09]: curb accidental ingestions, it remains
unclear if they will stop individuals from
[SPEAKER_09]: eating too much too fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Prominent Denver pot shop owner,
Ian Siebe, pointed to Goodman suicide to
[SPEAKER_09]: illustrate how much tragedies can't always
be prevented by the state, the industry
[SPEAKER_09]: and the regulations they draft.
[SPEAKER_09]: At no point do I feel the retailer who
sold the cannabis is responsible for his
[SPEAKER_09]: death, said Siebe, co-owner of Denver
Relief and chair of the National Cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a parent, but I was disappointed
because I know that if I have a friend or
[SPEAKER_09]: family member who's rambling incoherently
and not acting himself, I'm not leaving
[SPEAKER_09]: that person alone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Siebe referred to Goodman's family who
said he was acting erratically and he
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't recognize our presence almost.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had never seen him like this,
but they still chose to leave him alone in
[SPEAKER_09]: the condo as they went to the hot tub,
according to reports.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this dude was freaking out on a
cannabis edible, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what he did was walked into the room
and shot himself and killed himself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of what sparked a lot of
the re-examination of the cannabis edible
[SPEAKER_09]: rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, here's what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you come to Colorado and you eat some
edibles, respect that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: These aren't the brownies that your sister
used to make.
[SPEAKER_09]: These aren't the cookies that your mom
used to make back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are lab tested edibles made by
professionals.
[SPEAKER_09]: This started being made for medical
patients that had cancer, Crohn's disease,
[SPEAKER_09]: severe pain, cachexia.
[SPEAKER_09]: We needed a way to get these people well
and we weren't fucking around.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we figured out ways to make these
edibles right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys that are not taking it seriously,
you're going to get fucked up and you're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be on the news and we're going to
laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're going to mess up our laws
on our edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see how far we are into the
show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to read a couple more
articles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh dude, we're 22 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We might get another article, maybe two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to make sure we get this one
in.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're just going to skip that one and
read this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing
guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, if you come be on the show,
I have someone to talk to and then you can
[SPEAKER_09]: talk while I clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_09]: This article is going to piss you off.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one I found, where is this from?
[SPEAKER_09]: Worldnewsdailyreport.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the article is written by Bob Flanagan
and it said, Monsanto creates first
[SPEAKER_09]: genetically modified strain of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, St. Louis, Missouri, Monsanto,
the multi-billion agribusiness giant,
[SPEAKER_09]: has announced today it has patented the
first genetically modified strain of
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Monsanto is a breeder?
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell are they going to be at the
cup selling seeds?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me read this article for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, the news that has been welcomed
by scientists and leaders of the
[SPEAKER_09]: agriculture business alike as they move
forward toward the industrial use of
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana and hemp products could bring a
major shift towards marijuana policies in
[SPEAKER_09]: the USA and ultimately to the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Under present US federal law, it is
illegal to possess, use, buy, sell,
[SPEAKER_09]: or cultivate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the Controlled Substances Act of
1970 classifies marijuana as a schedule
[SPEAKER_09]: one drug, although it has been
decriminalized to some extent in certain
[SPEAKER_09]: states.
[SPEAKER_09]: Monsanto's interest in the field has been
interpreted by experts as the precursor to
[SPEAKER_09]: a major shift in marijuana policy in the
US.
[SPEAKER_09]: As it is believed, the company would not
have invested so much time and energy if
[SPEAKER_09]: it not had previous knowledge of the
federal government's openness toward the
[SPEAKER_09]: future legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lawyer and marijuana law specialist Edmund
Grosch of the Drug Policy Alliance admits
[SPEAKER_09]: Monsanto's involvement in marijuana
projects could definitely help the
[SPEAKER_09]: pro-legalization activists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, federal law criminalizes
marijuana and hemp derivatives because
[SPEAKER_09]: public opinion is still against it and
legal commercial production in the US is
[SPEAKER_09]: currently handled by a patchwork of small
farmers whom are not trusted by investors.
[SPEAKER_09]: A major player as Monsanto could bring
confidence within government and towards
[SPEAKER_09]: investors in the market if it were to own
a large part of the exploitable lands and
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial products.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is partly accurate, but I hate that.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let me keep reading.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's presently no way to control the
production of marijuana and the quality of
[SPEAKER_09]: the strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: A GM strain produced by a company with the
credentials and prestige of Monsanto would
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely lend a massive hand to
pro-legalization activists with the
[SPEAKER_09]: certain spheres of government and within
the business world, he explains.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fired up because I'm a cannabis
breeder and they're talking shit saying
[SPEAKER_09]: that, I don't know, I'm not trustable.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you use Monsanto because they've
got credentials and prestige that people
[SPEAKER_09]: are going to trust that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's true, but that sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because I've got dreadlocks and red
eyes doesn't mean I'm not trustable and
[SPEAKER_09]: credible.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, it goes on to say, although
Monsanto's testing on cannabis is only at
[SPEAKER_09]: an experimental stage, no plan has yet
been released by the agricultural business
[SPEAKER_09]: firm as to what purposes the patent strain
would be used for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Although specialists believe answers
should come this fall as rumors of a
[SPEAKER_09]: controversial new bill which could loosen
up laws around medical marijuana is
[SPEAKER_09]: reportedly scheduled to pass before
Congress coming this fall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Critics fear genetically modified cannabis
will mix with other strains and could
[SPEAKER_09]: destroy the diversity of DNA, a reality
dismissed by most studies claim.
Experts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got my own feelings about this
because I'm a breeder and all right,
[SPEAKER_09]: so I think Monsanto is going to find a
strain or use a strain that someone they
[SPEAKER_09]: know has been working with and they're
going to figure out ways to manipulate the
[SPEAKER_09]: genetic makeup of that plant to tweak it,
to be pest and mold resistant and grow the
[SPEAKER_09]: most desirable sets of traits a grower
could want, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be neat.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see them breed like a high CBD
strain that everybody could grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't that be awesome if Monsanto made
a high CBD low THC strain that you could
[SPEAKER_09]: put in your front yard and grow right next
to your shrubs?
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You could grow worldwide, be pennies a
pound, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But fucking no, that's not what Monsanto
does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what they could do, but they're the
fucking devil so they don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I think this is what's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to lead to a
commercialized strain that will definitely
[SPEAKER_09]: suck.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be like cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, tobacco probably smelled
and tastes good and now it just smells
[SPEAKER_09]: like fucking car exhaust because it's half
crap.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I think they're going to do
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll probably be terrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a big part of why people choose to
medicate themselves with medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: is because we don't want GMOs and
dangerous shit put into our bodies as
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've chosen to grow our own cannabis or
rely on a trustworthy caregiver like
[SPEAKER_09]: myself to grow the medical cannabis for us
so we don't have to buy pills and shit
[SPEAKER_09]: from a company.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was only a matter of time before
Monsanto came into the cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's my big conclusion on all this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wrote down some notes and I'm just
reading a little bullet points right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Monsanto teaming up with Big Pharma,
someone creating a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: program and Monsanto having the only
plants in that national medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how that shit works.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll own the patents on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: So nobody else can grow those seeds
without Monsanto permission.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to buy the seeds from
Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll also have the monopoly by being
the only strains that are available in
[SPEAKER_09]: these medically regulated stores.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of what I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll set up a national medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be like, oh, you guys want
legalized weed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go, nationally legalized.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they're going to say,
where's the weed going to come from?
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll say, we'll supply it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to say, who's going to
grow it?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to go, Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to get like that Monsanto
OG.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what you want, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That big 12% THC plant, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be terrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's what I predict.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I see coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to get creepy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how to prevent that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys all have to start growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Start growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like a lot of work, but to grow
your own cannabis, to be self-sufficient
[SPEAKER_09]: is not that hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you're paying for an ounce right
now, if you're buying it on the street,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're buying it at a dispensary,
you can get better, safer, cheaper
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis by growing your own.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know where to get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go to naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So never support any Monsanto companies or
their subsidiaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Never.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scotts, fucking all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is available commercially is mostly
Monsanto, like all your gardening
[SPEAKER_09]: products.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's mostly Monsanto shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scotts Turf Builder, all the Miracle Grow
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is all Monsanto shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the bug sprays and shit you see at
all your local hardware stores,
[SPEAKER_09]: mostly Monsanto products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to avoid that shit if you can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there is a march on Monsanto on May
23rd across the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Google that.
[SPEAKER_09]: March on Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be a part of that if you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: People go out and march in the streets and
talk about how they do not want these
[SPEAKER_09]: genetically modified products on the
shelves in our stores, and they do not
[SPEAKER_09]: want Monsanto taking over our food supply.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could rant on that for days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll definitely be keeping a personal eye
on this topic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got more news I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to check in and see how long we've
been recording.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to go too long here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys get fucking ADD on me.
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's read one more quick, quick news
article.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a quickie here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys will like this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: The DEA is not only seizing less cannabis,
they're asking to increase their legal
[SPEAKER_09]: growth three times for medical research.
[SPEAKER_09]: This article comes from the Leafly,
and who is it written by?
[SPEAKER_09]: Who gets credit here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody gets credit.
[SPEAKER_09]: No name on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just the Leafly is all, or Leafly.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, the Drug Enforcement
Administration is seizing less cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: year over year according to its own
records.
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2009, the agency confiscated and
destroyed 10.4 million cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas in 2013, the numbers fell to 4.4
million.
[SPEAKER_09]: And last year, the DEA seized 4.3 million.
[SPEAKER_09]: The steady decline can be attributed to
fewer funds being made available for
[SPEAKER_09]: enforcement, partly due to the economic
recession and partly because both the
[SPEAKER_09]: public and government stance on cannabis
has softened considerably over the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: With more states looking to legalize in
the next few years, as well as less
[SPEAKER_09]: funding being generated from local and
state police asset seizures, the downward
[SPEAKER_09]: trend should continue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, the DEA is shifting from the
ones doing the confiscating to the ones
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration has proposed to
increase the amount of cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_09]: legally allowed to produce by more than
300% in order to meet the demands of
[SPEAKER_09]: researchers who are studying the potential
medical benefits the plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it sounds weird that the DEA is
simultaneously seizing cannabis grows and
[SPEAKER_09]: growing their own plants for research
purposes, well, it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I fucking agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not only weird, that's
hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_09]: But hopefully we'll continue to see the
DEA shift its focus to regulating the
[SPEAKER_09]: legal market and focusing their efforts on
illegal grows and activity that damages
[SPEAKER_09]: the positive progress the industry is
making.
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides, we do need more cannabis research
to help propel the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the DEA can make it happen,
the administration is actually doing
[SPEAKER_09]: something positive for the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they get more money for more research,
hopefully they do the right thing with the
[SPEAKER_09]: research.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they're not trying to prove that
it's making people retarded or making
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking people turn into zombies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they're actually trying to
research that it helps with cancer,
[SPEAKER_09]: it helps with seizures, it helps with
nausea, it helps with depression.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really helps with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_09]: It pisses me off that in Colorado PTSD is
not a qualifying condition to get your
[SPEAKER_09]: medical marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really frustrating to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the last news article I want to
read.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to close up all the news here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about the news.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the growers meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want to remind you about.
[SPEAKER_09]: April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing
Supplies at 6 PM, there will be a growers
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the people that have been on the
podcast will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spence usually shows up.
[SPEAKER_09]: White Mike shows up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam will be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he doesn't have a life.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Adam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't wait to see you there, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can get some chicks to come.
[SPEAKER_09]: Female growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't just mean to call you chicks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come join us, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always one lady grower there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the two ladies that work at the
grow shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want more ladies to come join the
grow team.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a news article about
women and growing that I want to read on a
[SPEAKER_09]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't have time today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what else do we got going on?
[SPEAKER_09]: Come to the grow meeting, April 26th.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll learn something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to talk about grow schedules.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like keeping your grow rooms organized and
moving so that you don't have dead time in
[SPEAKER_09]: one of your rooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm also going to use that for a
future podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we're going to talk about improving
your crops on a future podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll get Jesse back for more outdoor
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, more organics with Sean.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a lot of great episodes planned for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: The next episode will be the Cannabis Cup
Review.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, it's going to be so great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to the shout outs and start
wrapping up the show.

[SPEAKER_09]: It was good bumping into you and taking
some dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on for taking care of everybody like
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't have a spot to plug in the email
in this club.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't have any damn three prong
outlet spots.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got an extension cord that didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: We found another room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We dabbed out that room, but then we
quickly got kicked out of there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We weren't allowed to dab in that room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, Kevin had a torch and a rig in
his car and it was close.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Kevin saved the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to dab out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big up for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's wrap up the show you guys.
