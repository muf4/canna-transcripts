[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what's up podcast world it is
time for episode 480 of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Curacao
live batter from our friends at Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of coin style and Tahitian
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package they describe the flavor as
vanilla and fruit chew and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that is completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you crack open the jar you get a
sweet smell at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a sniff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of some sweetness that hits
you almost like a cheesecake almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pastry of some sort but then right after
that you are overwhelmed with a fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: punch maybe a Hawaiian punch or fruity
Kool-Aid sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it another smell because I
can't get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dab it the first thing I
notice when I dab it is a vanilla frosting
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor hits my tongue and coats my tongue
very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale that fruit punch flavor
kind of goes over my tongue and lingers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the buzz is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me kind of chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my body feel nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to sit in a chair and be
nice and lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really enjoying the Curacao live
batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very unique aroma a very
delicious flavor and I absolutely approve
[SPEAKER_00]: of the buzz on the back of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that this product contains 69.37%
THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right podcast world this is going to
be a quick Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a couple of listener

[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send another special thank you
to everybody who is listening to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: and who supports the show no matter what
service or what provider you are listening
[SPEAKER_00]: or watching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed a giant increase in YouTube
video views.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more people are watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also noticed a giant increase in
listeners on the Stitcher radio
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you to everybody who is
listening on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This month on Stitcher we are currently
ranked number 45 in the lifestyle and
[SPEAKER_00]: health category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be in the top 100 of any category on
Stitcher is a great honor but I am at
[SPEAKER_00]: number 45 in my category at this current
time on Stitcher radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you to everybody who is
listening and supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of amazing, it's overwhelming
and I guess it's a sense of pride that it
[SPEAKER_00]: puts in me to know that this little show
that I produce here at my dining room
[SPEAKER_00]: table has become ranked number 45 in the
top 100 in my category.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you guys it's just some weirdo
with the microphone and way too many toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without you guys this show wouldn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the words of
encouragement, the emails, the tweets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Facebook messages, the Patreon

[SPEAKER_00]: all the love, all the respect and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's move forward and read
some emails from some of our loyal
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to send me an email,
my email address is growfromyourheart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I would love to hear from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I was listening
to a podcast where you named some grow
[SPEAKER_00]: books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any books for new growers that
are not just about breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: The books you mentioned were mostly
breeding books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they signed their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their name said,
but big shout out to our new friend Kay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some cannabis growing
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always encourage people to read,
grow books, read books from reputable
[SPEAKER_00]: authors who have done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you've got that book there for
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day there won't be the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day there won't be a bunch of
podcasts to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day you won't have Google,
but if you've got books on a shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always open them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look in them and that information
will always be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel there's something special
about bonding with a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feeling of opening the book and
finding the information you need and
[SPEAKER_00]: reading it off of paper and putting it
into your brain and storing it that way
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be more effective than just
Googling some shit and reading it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when you Google it,
you read it, you forget it, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes off the screen, it doesn't
stay in your head as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read a book, you can absorb a book,
it really sticks in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think books are really good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a grow wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not some grow Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have read a lot of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: So books are really good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the grow
books that I would suggest and recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few authors that I would
recommend almost any book they have
[SPEAKER_00]: written.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything and Everything by Greg Green will
be beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Green has written a book called The
Grow Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many grow authors have written The Grow
Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ones I can recommend come from Greg
Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Green has written a very wonderful
Grow Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read Anything and Everything from Greg
Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read Everything from Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk about two very
popular cannabis authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people talk about cannabis
cultivation in depth and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the information that is in their
books may seem a little bit outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the basics always work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things start getting complicated,
the first thing I tell a grower to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to the basics and find out where
you made your mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn from the very
beginning and you want a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis foundation, I will recommend
books from Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal published a book called The
Marijuana Grower's Handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great book for new growers,
for experienced growers, and advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody will learn something from this
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to argue with me and say
that Ed is old school, that a lot of Ed's
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and techniques are outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be so, but that old shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're just learning how to grow,
you need a foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to walk before you can
run and Ed will get you walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed will get you running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Grower's Handbook
is a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also recently put out a harvest book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other grow author I want to talk about
is Horace Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people, along with that Ed Rosenthal
category, will say that Horace is
[SPEAKER_00]: outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has a lot of great knowledge to
offer, especially to a new grower who
[SPEAKER_00]: needs a solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will suggest a book from Horace
Cervantes called Marijuana Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also offers several other books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all of the stuff from Horace
Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all of the stuff from Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all of Greg Green's books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all of Mel Frank's books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will recommend that you read books
from The Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rev wrote a book called True Living
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that one a read.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short wrote a book called Cultivating
Exceptional Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short is a great breeder, is a great
grower, and his book is filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Breeder Soma has also put out a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great book with great knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another author by the name of
Drew West who writes Great Cannabis Books.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Ed Rosenthal, Horace
Cervantes, Greg Green, Mel Frank,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rev, DJ Short, Drew West, and Soma are
all great authors that can teach you a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find most of those
books on Amazon or wherever you are
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing your books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do enough Google searching,
you should be able to find many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: books in a PDF format for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to download them and have
them right there in your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said earlier, I like to have
the actual book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the handheld book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bookshelf filled with grow
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab that book and go sit down and
just read a couple of chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I've got my computer in
front of me and I'm reading a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: chapters, I end up on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So close the computer, get out a book,
and learn some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while we are talking about books and
cannabis, there is another book I must
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to read The Emperor Wears No
Clothes by Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make some time to fit that book into
the rotation no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good for your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just need to read that if you want
to be on team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you have read all of your books,
there are great ways to supplement your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not ever overlook the education we can
get from podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasts are free and many of them are
loaded with great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like about a podcast is that
I can learn something while I'm driving to
[SPEAKER_00]: another location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can learn stuff while I'm in the shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an earbud in my left ear while
I'm watering my own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm learning about growing cannabis
while I'm growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoy the education that I get
from podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will recommend a few podcasts to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have to recommend The Dude
Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to The Dude and we cannot
forget Guru and the rest of The Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: crew up there in Fort Collins and spread
out across the nation, across the world at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you listen to The Dude Grows
Show that is available anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine podcasts are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got Cannabis, Cultivation and
Sciences by Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Tad Hussey has a lot to offer
for an advanced cannabis cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great podcast I should recommend
is Shaping Fire with Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really great podcast and you
will have an opportunity to learn a wealth
[SPEAKER_00]: of information from that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of other podcasts out
there, but once you start downloading one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two of these podcasts, iTunes or
whatever service you're listening on will
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend more cannabis related podcasts
to you and you will find the show that
[SPEAKER_00]: fits your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just simply don't like the
host or you don't like someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: personality on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't like the flow of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find many shows that do fit for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also will find shows you simply cannot
listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some podcasts that I'm sure
would be great for me educational wise or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe social wise, but I just can't handle
the host or the tone of the show or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a podcast that works for you and
learn from that while you're in the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're in the shower, throw an
earbud in the ear and work in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overlook the possibility of
learning from podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that answered the question
and then some you asked for some books and
[SPEAKER_00]: some authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you a nice list of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you an extensive list of authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I went as far as to recommend a few
other podcasts that you can learn from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever have more questions,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, big time listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking of purchasing an RO filter
today and today's podcast answered my
[SPEAKER_00]: question I had about using that to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few episodes back, I had a question
about flushing with RO water and it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like I answered this person's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to know that I'm helping
people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say your podcast is
inspiring and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you sharing the wealth
because it has helped me with working on
[SPEAKER_00]: my own crosses and making better choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, and that is a great statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that the show is inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like inspiring people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Informative is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am here to share the wealth of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't share the knowledge,
I feel like I would be ripping people off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a gift I was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to put that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm glad that I have helped you
work on your own crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means a lot that I have helped you
make better choices in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you are setting yourself up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're planning ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you have and should
continue to have a successful garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to wear glitter,
but I'll definitely be celebrating as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work and keep my name on
the down low to please.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want their name said,
but they know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for the huge compliments and
keep listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said you've made some of your own
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some emails and let me know about
the breeding that I've helped you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email right here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and Jesse have fired me up for
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having Jesse come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having Sean come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having Frosty come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about organics and get people
fired up about taking care of their garden
[SPEAKER_00]: organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those episodes also seem to inspire people
to take better care of themselves when we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about feeding our plants organically
and taking better care of our environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and being more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to spark something inside of
people or they want to do the same for
[SPEAKER_00]: their own bodies, which makes a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we take as good a care of
ourselves as we do our gardens?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to use our plants as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be taking top care of ourselves,
but we often overlook that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those organic episodes do get a lot of
people inspired in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes on to say the soil is
alive and we are working together along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we absolutely are.
[SPEAKER_00]: By us giving it the best life we can,
the plant in turn helps us have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: life we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have talked in several episodes about
how I feel the plant gives us back in
[SPEAKER_00]: tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in that grow room and you give
that plant a little bit of love,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to give you back tenfold the
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've given it some care, some
patience and pay attention to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to show you that ten times
when it comes time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you ignore those plants and don't
take care of them, they will show you
[SPEAKER_00]: tenfold when it comes time for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely believe that these plants
help us out karmically the same way that
[SPEAKER_00]: we help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, big shout out to White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and respect from your friend,
Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tim, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that we have inspired you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pass the shout out to Jesse and
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to get you guys on another
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Tim, I want to thank you again
for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next message for this podcast goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff, my second question is
about pests also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this comes from somebody who we have
answered their question before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, now I have been fighting gnats
all through this grow, but once I harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to possibly reuse the soil as
much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering what you thought about
this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this would only work in the middle of
summer, more than likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to seal your soil in a black garbage
bag and let it sit out in the heat for six
[SPEAKER_00]: to eight hours, surely it would hit over
100 degrees in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if that way, if it would
kill whatever may have going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to a guy that gets rid of
bed bugs and he says he heats the house to
[SPEAKER_00]: like 106 degrees, which pretty much kills
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering how you feel about this
ghetto do-it-yourself idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually driving around with a 50
pound bag of ocean forest in my car just
[SPEAKER_00]: for this reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they want their name set
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person is asking about recycling
soil that had fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had fungus gnats in their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they harvest, they would like to
recycle the soil, but they are smart and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are concerned about getting these
fungus gnats back in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recycling soil and soilless mix and cocoa
are very common practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very cost effective and it also
saves the big question of what do I do
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of this soil or soilless mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you grew six seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a whole bunch of leftover
soilless mix at the end of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put it in a trash bag and
put it out by the curb for the trash guy
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to sprinkle it out through
the backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somebody else that needs it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has a big farm or a backyard
where they can dump their old soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person wants to figure out a way
to recycle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, that would be a very easy
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mainly just rinse it so you don't have
a bunch of leftover nutrients from the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe run some enzymes through there to
help clean it out, run your fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: through it, get all the big shit out,
and then you can basically recycle that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or soilless mix or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this situation, we had a small bug
infestation, so we are curious if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something like a fungus gnat,
I would feel confident that that hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and six hundred and twenty degree range
would get rid of the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I believe there are probably
insects that would survive that treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably insects or eggs that
would outlast that heat blast treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the insect expert, but I have
treated rooms with chemicals and heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: just about anything I could throw at them,
and I have had spider mites return.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am assuming that those spider mites
were there from the dormant eggs that I
[SPEAKER_00]: did not destroy during my cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am not certain that a hundred and six
to a hundred and twenty degrees would get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of every pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel confident that it would get rid of
your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't one of the most aggressive,
one of the strongest pests that we battle,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think that will work for your fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do not know that that would
work for other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you confidence and
false guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you are certain that the
problem was only fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: this should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says you're using fifty pounds of
ocean forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably three bags of dirt,
and three bags of ocean forest soil will
[SPEAKER_00]: cost you somewhere between forty five and
seventy five dollars depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: location and the taxes and possibly
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be safer to discard fifty
pounds of soil and replace it if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about a bug problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do reuse that soil and it has got a
pest, it is going to cost you more than
[SPEAKER_00]: fifty to seventy five dollars worth of
pain in the ass, worth of effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of product, worth of struggle to get
rid of those bugs you could have prevented
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do insist on reusing this soil,
verify that fungus gnats were the only
[SPEAKER_00]: pest in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do your hundred and six to a hundred
and twenty degree trash bag in the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: method and make sure that you have killed
every pest in that batch of dirt before
[SPEAKER_00]: you try to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you are not one hundred percent
confident that fungus gnats were the only
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in that soil, I would discard the
soil and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing I would do is make sure that
you have got fungus gnats and make sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a different pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got root aphids or if you have
got fungus gnats, there are two different
[SPEAKER_00]: plans of attack, two different battles,
two different strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So verify that your problem is fungus
gnats and if that is a fungus gnats in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, your method should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is a root aphid, we have to have a
different strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend, I am not sure if you
want your name set on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but big thank you and big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how this works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you are confident that
those are fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you actually do this,
let me know how this works out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this get rid of your problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it actually the pest we thought it
was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
