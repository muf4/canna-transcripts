slash grow from your heart Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to the show everybody in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to focus on a new strain,
which I'm going to release for 420 Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a couple of other things before
we get to that strain highlight in a
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episode I did talk about finding
a male plant out of a pack of feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds I talked about how rare that could
be I talked about the opportunities For
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was enlightened by a great friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want a shout out I
don't know if they want their business out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but I'm just going to say that I
was educated about a very great male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from feminized seed stock
somebody had seeds They had a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: they loved they couldn't get to that plant
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was taken from them They had seed stock
that feminized seeds within that fem stock
[SPEAKER_00]: They did find a male and they use that
male to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes regular seeds But those regular
seeds do seem to put out a higher ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: females So there has been a discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been updated There is a likelihood of
a male popping up in female stock and when
[SPEAKER_00]: it does Sometimes it has proven itself to
be a very useful tool for a good breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was an update I wanted to share
with you Also, we talked about using spent
[SPEAKER_00]: barley in a previous episode a listener
asked about using spent barley from a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From a brewery to use that in a commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said there's a bunch of stuff left
over I got mixed reviews and mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: emotions in response to using the spent
barley Some people said you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get way too many bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they tried it They had too many
bugs it had too many sugars other people
[SPEAKER_00]: said they do it and it works beautifully
So I got both sides of that story I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe both of those people because who
knows what the the other factors were that
[SPEAKER_00]: could have contributed to that but I did
hear positives and negatives I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure To update you guys and share
that with you because I like the feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the info and the people that
replied are great people in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that I greatly respect and trust Wanted to
share that info All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to talk about is the
discord channel you guys the I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics grow from your heart podcast the
Rasta Jeff discord channel has Exploded
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so many members users viewers
visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is out of control I'm going to ask you
guys one time just play nicely be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: over there I'm pretty sure everybody
listening watching participating now is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally kind and totally cool But as the
leader of the iry army the guy whose name
[SPEAKER_00]: is on that fucking discord I just want to
ask you one time just be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are indirectly Representing me
and it turns out you were directly
[SPEAKER_00]: representing me in some people's eyes So
just remember some of the shit you say
[SPEAKER_00]: over there could be taken a skew could be
taken wrong and it could Accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: represent the iry army in a negative
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind When you're keep that
in mind when you're posting commenting
[SPEAKER_00]: scrolling and trolling, honestly,
you guys do your thing being adult But
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind you are on a public forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might get salty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just be nice Also, if you got upset,
I can't babysit everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people over there It's
the internet show me where the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: hurts you today, but let's play nice you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's play nice Let's be all-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't condone promote I'm not down with
any bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no racism.
[SPEAKER_00]: No No, none of that crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna segregate segregate
organization Discriminate anybody over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's there to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just focus on that I've already
given it way too much attention Let's move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to the main topic of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get ready to ramble I said at the
top of the show We're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: a strain that I'm going to release for 420
that strain is the blueberry cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to Jack the Ripper Let me back up
one step just in case you're not aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rosted Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I the Host and producer of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the sole proprietor I am I read
genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me I do everything from the
breeding the selecting the packaging the
[SPEAKER_00]: social media stuff the email stuff It is
all just me with that being said if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending me emails and I'm not responding
right away It's cuz I've got about 14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: unread me emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying but I Read genetics premium
seeds is all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make regular and feminized guns Just
seeds for the legal market so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce high quality medicine and
recreational cannabis for themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: their clientele In a legal fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently Recently we lost a breeder
who taught me a lot and inspired me a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: That man was known by sub cool a lot of
you that are listening know who sub cool
[SPEAKER_00]: was if you didn't know who sub cool was
already I invite you to just press pause
[SPEAKER_00]: on my show Google sub cool Google the weed
nerd watch some weed nerd show Fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: love with subbies fall in love with sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say I meant it but it was
hard to say fall in love with subby Just
[SPEAKER_00]: like we all did learn from sub a lot of my
teachings a lot of my learning a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: education a lot of my delivery and style
came from sub I like to say I learned a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of what to do and also a lot of what
not to do in the cannabis industry from my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend sub cool Dude wasn't perfect wasn't
an angel, but he was a bad motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was my friend He taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sub cool passed away rest in peace
subby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you the whole iry army Misses you we
all love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you were still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not so in honor what I did I got a
pack of seeds that were bred by sub cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and I found a male out of that package of
seeds I found a jack the ripper male that
[SPEAKER_00]: was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a stud He was a ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a nice aroma a nice structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He flowered well He had the right shape to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what I was looking for the male
plant had trichomes I've posted so many
[SPEAKER_00]: photos of this male jack the ripper plant
the whole project was posted on my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram on Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I found this jack the ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed it to my prized blueberry
cookies female I got that blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies female from a commercial grow
several years ago And I've been crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: it to a lot of things and it is an amazing
plant It does a lot of great breeding I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually googling jack the ripper right
now because I didn't write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and It's got a lot of different
things in it when I get to that point I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want to be able to give you the
exact details on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the jack the ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part Where I want to read you
the details of what jack the ripper is and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of finding the male it brought up
the serial killer Of course, so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: type in strain instead of cross because
it's gonna be a lot more info It's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cross of I'm trying to just go
quickly on this show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to know if I'm 21 or older I used
to go to sub cools website and that link
[SPEAKER_00]: is now it's a dead link now He's probably
not paying the bill since he's passed away
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the ripper or JTO JTR Is the flagship
hybrid from sub cooled the dank and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: created to make his famous Jack's cleaner
in seed form It's known as the fastest
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon haze available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to know the genetics It is
space dude and Jack Jack the and Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herrera, but I wanted a better breakdown
of it now I feel very unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably not even gonna edit this I
used to go to sub site you guys that site
[SPEAKER_00]: is gone now Jack the ripper seeds Now
let's do strain details.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better It's probably gonna take me
to like seed finder or something but I
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to use leafly that's whack All
right, you may have noticed a quick edit
[SPEAKER_00]: there you may not have noticed anything I
don't know what you're talking about Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about Jack the ripper the male that I
chose Jack the ripper is a cross of Jack's
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner and space Queen space Queen is Sub
cools prized male space dude was the
[SPEAKER_00]: prized male sort of like my King Solomon
how that is what I cross everything to
[SPEAKER_00]: space dude Is what sub cool crossed
everything to so we've got a Jack's
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner to space Queen or the space dude
male Let's talk about Jack's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pluton and lamb's bread and
purple haze and northern lights Cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the pluton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what pluton is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an unknown strain, but we've got
lamb's bread in there Definitely a classic
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorites a Jamaican favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got purple haze in there It doesn't get
any more classic than purple haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got northern lights in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an old school One then that is
crossed to the Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of great lineage in the
Jack's cleaner That is crossed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: space Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if there's a breakdown for the
space Queen That is Romulan and Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a lot of great stuff going in
there We got the Romulan also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a short squat II Faster flowering
kind of a sativa dominant plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers quite quickly cross to the Cindy
99 Big shout out to our friends brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham big shout out to mr Soul for the
Cindy 99 that's got Princess and p94 which
[SPEAKER_00]: is Jack Herrera to a mystery male So we've
got Jack Herrera on two different ends of
[SPEAKER_00]: this It was sort of subs kind of an idea
to make his version of Jack Herrera or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's cleaner seed form So we've got Jack
the Ripper The reason I wanted to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: the to Jack the Ripper is I really love
I've smoked a lot of Jack the Ripper It
[SPEAKER_00]: represents sub cool very well It's not
using his space Queen or his space Dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would have been too obvious to make
a Jack sub cool tribute cross So I made a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper cross because it's one of
his flagship strains I love the flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: and aromas that come from that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got these are the phenotypes that I
found I found a key lime pie phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just delicious lots of lemon lemon
cleaner like lemon pledges bathroom
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner and lemons lots of just crazy
lemon candy and cleaner flavors So I like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jack the Ripper for the buzz the
flavor the aroma And the growth it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: really sativa like head ringing buzz But
it doesn't take a super long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower you could get it done in 63 days
Some strains that give you that potency
[SPEAKER_00]: that buzz take closer to 70 72 days So
it'd come down a week early and he'd still
[SPEAKER_00]: get wrecked from it, which I really like I
like that panic attack heart racing
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Lose your keys when they're in
your hand Can't find your cell phone when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ringing in your pocket sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that kind of herb Waiting for the
stoplight to turn green or the stop sign
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn green Waiting for the stop sign to
turn green is one of my favorite kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs if you got that kind of weed That's
the best the kind of weed you got to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: down the radio so that you can see the
street signs better That's this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is Jack the Ripper That is the
male that I selected from the sub cool
[SPEAKER_00]: side of this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about the female We got to
talk about the female I chose to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the female in this cross was the
blueberry cookies That is blueberry cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to Tahoe OG Then cross to the thin mint
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite crosses I've
made the Leonardo that is Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what Leonardo is then from there
We've got six other out crosses of
[SPEAKER_00]: Leonardo to make the TMNT line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it to make that full Feminized
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also the blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a rise cross to the The blueberry
cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my brain went totally numb for a
minute there the arise pollinating the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookie Makes the blue raspberry
truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also thinking about the blue pill is
the blueberry cookies to the reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat So I've made a lot of things
with this blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites I kicks ass now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got the blueberry cookies cross to
Jack the Ripper I don't think I've even
[SPEAKER_00]: said the name of it yet, which is I'm
doing that on purpose I'm trying to build
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of suspense to the best of my
recum election.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not said the name So we've talked
about the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the Jack the Ripper why
I selected that Jack the Ripper to First
[SPEAKER_00]: reason was to tribute to tribute subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second reason was flavor aroma structure
flowering time and potency All of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things are amazing with Jack the Ripper
very good breeding candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got the blueberry cookies Why do
I breed to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is vigorous You can beat the shit out
of that plant and it will recover you
[SPEAKER_00]: could pee on it light it on fire and kick
it over and Leave and then tomorrow when
[SPEAKER_00]: you come back that plant will be standing
up stronger than it ever was going That's
[SPEAKER_00]: a good try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you thought you were
gonna do to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is a boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a savage It grows amazingly well in
all conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is potent as shit It harvests very well
and it breeds very very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good breeder It brings a lot
to the table in breeding, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: allows a lot to be added to it in breeding
It's a good ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a dominant flavor in the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets things open up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the blueberry cookies the
blueberry to Tahoe to the Cookies we got
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jack the Ripper, which has got the
lamb's bread the AK 47 the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it makes a can or the lights in my
head all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about in the future So we got a
whole hodgepodge of genetics going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: that one Then do I want to tell you the
name of it or do I want to talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I why I selected them that blueberry
cookies is a champ and I knew they would
[SPEAKER_00]: breed well together Something about when I
see two plants, I just go ooh you it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like just hanging out with friends hanging
out with two people You know and now I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to say hanging out with A guy and you
know a girl, but it's 2021 you're hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out with a person and you go Hey,
you know bill you may really like Steve or
[SPEAKER_00]: you may really like Emily I don't know
which fucking one but hypothetically you
[SPEAKER_00]: may like one of them and you just know it
and you hook bill up with Steve or Emily
[SPEAKER_00]: and they got a fucking completely happy
future just because you could see it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy, it's got to be Bill and Emily
because they're gonna breed sorry Steve,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Bill and Emily are gonna breed and
they make beautiful children and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: go ha ha I got to I got to predict that
that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plants I could just see it sometimes
I know that if I pollinate that girl with
[SPEAKER_00]: that male the offspring is gonna be
fucking stellar Sometimes I just know that
[SPEAKER_00]: so I took the Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the blueberry cookies female Don't
worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also pollinated a bunch of other females
when I did this so there will be other
[SPEAKER_00]: females released with other cool names
We'll talk about that in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Jack the Ripper f2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really fun project So I did the
pollination we made the project I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about why I've talked about the
selections talked about the parents Talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about blueberry cookies talked about JTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this cross make this cross makes
crazy pungent crazy potent Sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids that smell and taste are you ready
for these flavor descriptions?
[SPEAKER_00]: These came from my testers you guys I
didn't make these up blueberry syrup
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry fun dip fake blue candy flavors
lemon berries Weird sour stuff and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought one smelled Like Red Bull and
somebody else told me they smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: purple Flintstone vitamins I think the Red
Bull and Flintstone vitamins may be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else said it was vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was Red Bull We're getting
blueberry blueberry syrup blueberry fun
[SPEAKER_00]: dip fake blue candy flavors And then we
got lemon berries weird sour stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good description because
it's weird sour stuff I say it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: wang to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell and you're like, I just kind of
wang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a wang to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deliciously wangy It's got a really
nice flavor Sour stuff Red Bull vitamins
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a lot of people said lemon
cleaner smells like chemicals and cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of wonderful marvelous
aromas coming from this Some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: almost kind of burn your eyes in a good
good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates didn't get to smoke a lot
They went really quickly the concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: were almost a Lemon spicy it was almost so
much lemons that it like hit your nose and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned your sinuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could almost feel it I heated up the
dab nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could almost feel it and it was like a
saucy diamond consistency When I would put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the banger I could almost taste it
and feel the effervescence hitting my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs and nose before the dab even felt
like it Vaporized or volatized or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it did in my banger before I saw smoke or
vapor in the the rig I could feel those
[SPEAKER_00]: turps hitting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like spicy lemony like if you've
ever cleaned cleaned anything With orange
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like using lemon cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very terpy very terpadelic with a
little bit of a spiciness to it I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be a long fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really having a good time behind the
mic today I've needed to get behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: mic for a minute and let loose Let's talk
about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people said the buzz was very
Social some people said they wish they
[SPEAKER_00]: would let it go longer because they cut it
too early and they got a really high racy
[SPEAKER_00]: head buzz I got the word talkative and
chatty from a Lot of people who tested
[SPEAKER_00]: this they were so when you smoke this you
turn into me you just start fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: talking just Talkative and chatty,
but sometimes you don't know what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just talk you into circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll talk yourself into space It's
mind-moving as something I wrote Something
[SPEAKER_00]: about those Jack the Ripper Jack hair
turps in there mixed with the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies turps in there is something just
moves your brain Sometimes it can give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people reported it was too much too
heavy They said when they cut it down too
[SPEAKER_00]: early They were a little bit panicky a
little bit racy and a little bit bug-eyed
[SPEAKER_00]: and they wish they'd let it go a little
bit longer So it'll make you talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you social.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mind-moving Sometimes it'll give you
a panic, but it will give you a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: moving head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get you going really good So that is
the consumption factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice it makes sure it makes my eyes
Completely fucking red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it did that to anybody
else cannabis doesn't make my eyes red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a smoke Hard to get red eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be like the late-night session
once I'm burned out and maxed out for the
[SPEAKER_00]: day But this stuff smoking on this strain
that I haven't named yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to dodge the name I'm gonna
give you the name just to be fun here
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon But this stuff did make my
eyes completely super red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got aromas We got the buzz now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the most
important factors to a lot of you This is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this going to work for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to talk about is these
were some of the healthiest is healthiest
[SPEAKER_00]: most healthy seeds I have ever produced
I've been making seeds for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some plants just make ugly seeds
Sometimes some plants make beautiful seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: almost every seed that came out of this
run was beautiful What was the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: the new addition the new anomaly the new
change-up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannon LEDs from black sale market big
shout out to my buddy Keith it black sale
[SPEAKER_00]: market are Those cannon LEDs made my seeds
beautiful bigger fatter robust It could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been that male but man those seeds
were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the light I think it was
the light because every seed sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: get some shitty seeds in the mix The seeds
on the bottom of the plant don't look
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some white dead seeds It didn't
get any of those all of the seeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the biggest baddest healthiest
most beautiful seeds I've ever bred they
[SPEAKER_00]: were done under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Got a lot of reports of really good
Female to male ratios a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are popping up female So that is
really awesome for you guys out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make any guarantees, but the
reports a lot of females Also a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: very good germination rates 90 to 100%
German germination rates from almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody I sent seeds to the people that
said they didn't get good germs They said
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves I fucked something up So I'm
gonna say we got more than 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: germination, which is that qualifies in my
book These plants veg very vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't veg like Something that would
be crossed with the rise They don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that hyper vigor, but they veg quickly and
they veg very strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are strong Where are we
going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place in my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go They make that classic
Christmas tree kind of a menorah shape
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow branchy bottom and they grow at
the top goes real tall the other branches
[SPEAKER_00]: try to catch up to that We're gonna talk
more about how to deal with that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute here In veg there's nothing super
indicative of Which phenotype you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: other than leaf size we'll talk more
specifically about phenotypes later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode But you're not gonna be able to
tell which phenotype you've got early in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg Unless you've got huge maple leaf size
leaves Those are the platinum cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy phenotypes if you get the super thin
leaf That's Jack anything in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: there or it could be kind of lamb's bread
II Jack lamb's bread leaning I'm not super
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced with the lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you enough details to know if
that's What I'm seeing but most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna lie anywhere in between there
You're gonna get big fat leaves or real
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny leaves or anywhere in between
because this is a crazy hybrid with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different genetics So you're gonna see
big mashups of different things Most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will make one big dominant top
and a nice bushy bottom I know bushy
[SPEAKER_00]: bottoms gonna get a lot of people's
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all like that big bottom girls It does
get that big fat bottom, but it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: grow one main top and it's gonna keep
growing that Christmas tree Menorah sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of shape I generally top it we're gonna
talk more about that I call it making it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a menorah or a Christmas tree with
what I call the leader one ambitious
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking leader You got to knock that
leader out in my opinion most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest topping these plants I keep
saying it's gonna make that one liter top
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all the bottoms coming up cut out
that main top and then it creates a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: like a shrub like just a nice bush If you
put it in a big pot, these plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out really nicely So when you put
these plants into flower, they will
[SPEAKER_00]: transition into bloom very quickly is
something I've noticed that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm growing under LEDs and when I
switch from 18 6 to 11 13 they trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower super quickly But it is
something I observed these plants went
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly than other plants in the same
room They triggered quickly into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They transfer transition quickly into the
bloom phase These plants love being tied
[SPEAKER_00]: together Tied down they're weird girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be twisted popped and
tortured and held down You can do that to
[SPEAKER_00]: these girls pop them twist them be
careful, but you can do that They like to
[SPEAKER_00]: be tied down trellis down and netted down
so you can do that Into like week three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four a flower They get soft and vine like
these plants will grow with like some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are known to get woody and hard and
they don't bend and pop and twist as
[SPEAKER_00]: easily as these plants will these plants
get like Like a sappy wire structure like
[SPEAKER_00]: you could bend them and wrap them around a
vine They are very very twisty and viney.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pop pop and twist them very carefully
because of that viney structure Sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll just blow up that whole stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go to twist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just rip off or you'll just
explode the whole thing But they're soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take care of them and stay nice and
healthy They'll be soft and supple and
[SPEAKER_00]: pliable and bright bright green Tie them
down twist them they will need some
[SPEAKER_00]: supports because they're So twisty so
pliable some of those longer branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially your bottom branches are gonna
get droopy and floppy Give them some love
[SPEAKER_00]: give them some support some plant Viagra
if you will Now I keep saying that these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will stay soft and really light
green and very supple and very pliable
[SPEAKER_00]: That is if we properly feed them these
plants will get a little bit picky about
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients You can't overfeed them But
they like a lot of nitrogen and veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to drop that shit out almost
immediately as you Transition into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention to these plants because
they're picky with Nutrients if you
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeed them when they go into flower,
they don't make big buds They just make
[SPEAKER_00]: little sparse buds and they make a lot of
branching and a lot of leaves if your
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are Not doing the normal leaf shape
thing you expect if they're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mutate a little bit They're
getting too much nitrogen in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be one very quick indicator of
too much nitrogen They'll take the
[SPEAKER_00]: feedings They'll take a little bit of heat
They're going to get super frosty and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to make what I call taco
leaves or what also is known as a resin
[SPEAKER_00]: rail The leaves that come out of the the
main buds are going to get resin on them
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly when it gets warm in the grow
room or a little bit humid in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room They will canoe or taco on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't think that is from the room being
too hot I think that is just a trait from
[SPEAKER_00]: the jack the ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I saw the jack the
ripper do some of the Unotypes from JTR
[SPEAKER_00]: did that some of the offspring are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's a problem in the
room I don't think you're fucking up I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it just wants to taco up and
make room for resin because the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up out of the top of that taco I don't
think it's your fault So if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeeding it if your pH isn't fucked up
And if it's not too hot or too humid or
[SPEAKER_00]: too dry in the room You're getting a
little bit of like just leaf tacoing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of leaf canoeing with trichomes
on top Don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what this plant does Another thing
this plant does not tolerate cold if you
[SPEAKER_00]: get them cold, they'll go yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stop eating They'll get pissed off
at you Another thing don't over defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about leafing the plants that I
breed it Don't do that to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Girl Scout cookies doesn't like being
defoliated heavily The jack hair is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of super defoliation Guess what the
blueberry cookies jack the ripper cross
[SPEAKER_00]: does not like to be defoliated heavily
Moderate defoliation at best don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: super hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is relying on those skinny
leaves for energy So don't piss it off and
[SPEAKER_00]: take too many off over defoliating getting
it cold overfeeding it Some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: we think would boost up some plants Those
things are what piss off this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more of a challenging
plant You can't be that new guy that tries
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it more shit and do more to it to
make it speed up This is one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that less will do better I think
this plant it's got a lot of hodgepodge
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics But I think this would have been
found more like in some tropical area
[SPEAKER_00]: where people couldn't have gotten to it
and it would have just been fucked up and
[SPEAKER_00]: Abandoned by people and then it would just
been out there in nature and it would have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone Crazy tall and gotten out of control
and it didn't need a lot of attention It
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want you to defoliate it didn't
want you to give it too much care Just let
[SPEAKER_00]: it grow and give it supports and I think
it'll be okay Also, I think it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like wind a lot of the phenotypes I grew
and experienced everybody by the face They
[SPEAKER_00]: were all perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cool the jack-the-ripper crosses
that were by the fan They do not tolerate
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't give them too much wind Don't
blow too hard on them and don't get them
[SPEAKER_00]: too cold the cold pissed them off and made
them slow down Something I can say these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow really well until you piss
them off If you stay out of their way,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them happy give them a solid feed pay
attention to the feed High nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning taper off that nitrogen start
raising up your phosphorus and potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it just like you should a basic
plant They'll work very well the minute
[SPEAKER_00]: you screw something up with these plants
once they go yellow once they go angry
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucked They get yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start crisping up cold will do it
too much moisture will do it too much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients will do it They're really easy
to grow once once you get them going but
[SPEAKER_00]: once they're angry it is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the haze Makes it go super fast
and the og makes it super finicky you
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that it's super Quick to be super
finicky was soon as something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets you know So if you're growing in
hydro, keep an eye on it if you're a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or soilless makes person you may have some
time to rebound or recover but It's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to let you know when it's got problems
also stay on top of up potting and root
[SPEAKER_00]: boundness because when this one gets root
bound She'll stop growing as soon as the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots hit the outside of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes now I'm done I like to test
things in cups and get them started in
[SPEAKER_00]: cups these little bitches hit the ends
edges of the cups and just Stopped they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they're fucking angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just at the edge I had to up
bottom as soon as I up potted them
[SPEAKER_00]: shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went crazy again So also a couple of
them tried to flower on me once they got
[SPEAKER_00]: to root bound that is something to think
about It likes all of the light Some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants some of the plants I had to turn
down the cannon LEDs Move them right out
[SPEAKER_00]: from underneath there because they don't
like all that light put the jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: ripper crosses Directly under the light
put the light on the jack the ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses feed the light to these plants It
wants all of the fucking light that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that these plants want light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take it It's got lamb's bread in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got jack hair in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take some fucking light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it all the light It doesn't like wind
I mentioned that if you put them too close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fan They get pissy if it gets too
dry in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get pissy if it gets too wet in there
Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They get pissy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep it just right in there
They're a little bit weird some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this got fried by LEDs I put
some new plants in a room and with them
[SPEAKER_00]: new Built room with some brand-new LEDs
the tops of some of them roasted guess
[SPEAKER_00]: what the jack the rippers didn't do they
didn't roast They just took it everything
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to the jack the ripper was fine
with being punished by too much light They
[SPEAKER_00]: were unscathed is the word I put on my
notes the next part to talk about they
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch These plants will stretch on you
the first few days of flower They're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take off but but but but top them not
in flower before you flower them top them
[SPEAKER_00]: pop them and twist them and that's We'll
slow down the stretch give them a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: feed Give them a nice NPK and they will
not take off too fast on you, but they do
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch they get tall on you I lost my
place on my notes Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Feeding feeding the skinny leaf
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I missed this part They're super easy
to clone when you take that top off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant clone it because they are super
easy to clone They love to clone you could
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just set it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make a clone Feeding the skinny
leaf phenotype wants less food and higher
[SPEAKER_00]: pH But don't slow down the calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said less food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't knock out the calcium So I'll repeat
that the skinnier leaf phenotypes want
[SPEAKER_00]: less food So if you got a real thin
phenotype thinly phenotype it wants less
[SPEAKER_00]: food and a higher pH But it also wants
more calcium don't slow down the calm egg
[SPEAKER_00]: on that thin leaf phenotype all of the
phenotype seem to love calcium Later in
[SPEAKER_00]: life not when they're little they got
pissy when we give them a lot of cow mag a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of calcium Later on in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to feed moderately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overfeed give them that cow mag
Overfeeding nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the note I wanted to make sure to
get you makes them stretchy and leafy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't make buds so Early in
flower taper off that nitrogen But pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what they're doing if they're
getting yellow keep that nitrogen going,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather be fat So if you're a
guy or a gal that feeds once every three
[SPEAKER_00]: days and then gives it water and then
water and then feed I Said that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird if you feed and then once a week and
then give it water throughout the week
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe feed twice a week maybe feed three
times a week if you're growing in cocoa or
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro Definitely feed these bitches every
time pay attention your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too high They would rather have
low feeding every day than a high feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Feed them low and often they love Cocoa
and Ottawa auto water systems they go
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy and aeroponics and cocoa they clone
like fucking crazy and aeroponics cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: They explode in an easy cloner these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it right here several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make crazy crazy roots But once those
roots hit the walls, they stop growing
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how I would grow these
plants I feel like I've got a lot to say
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like I've been going for a long
time, but that's cool Let me take a drink
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll continue with this and take a
sip this is how I would grow these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: I Would veg them in a cup or a six inch
net pot Until you see them stop growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that means they're root bound as soon as
they're caught Then put them in a three or
[SPEAKER_00]: a five or a seven gallon pot I would only
transplant them one time because they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: so vigorously that that's a waste of time
doing staggered or graduated pots go from
[SPEAKER_00]: your cup to your final big daddy final
shoes your graduation pot so I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend either nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let me start here on this note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend either five No,
that's not what I meant to even write I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend four seven gallon pots or
six five gallon pots Veg those so let me
[SPEAKER_00]: say that again because I did stumble
through the start of that four seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots Per light this is in like a
five by five area We're gonna base this on
[SPEAKER_00]: a five by five tent or 1,000 watt light or
one of key It's cannon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say four seven gallon pots so
that's a section about this big is the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start spreading them out as they
grow four seven gallons or Six five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a little bit smaller and a
couple more plants depending on your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count This could be very very influential
if you got a low plant count do more big
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking plants That's the way to do it if
you got unlimited plants Just do a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of little plants and veg for like a week
and flip them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do four Seven gallon pots or six
five gallon pots veg those until they are
[SPEAKER_00]: about knee-high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tall dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to my knee tall knee Top those at that
time then spread it out with either a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato cage or a trellis net or sticks You
could put sticks in there angling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put them angling in however You
want to do it but spread those tops out so
[SPEAKER_00]: light gets to that whole plant Leaf it a
little bit so the plant penetrates or the
[SPEAKER_00]: light penetrates in there So then you've
got either four sevens or six fives Veg to
[SPEAKER_00]: knee-high top them spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them recover then flip them or or
here's another option I would do nine
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallon pots on the same footprint
just smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna veg for less time We're gonna
veg for like two three Maybe four weeks at
[SPEAKER_00]: all in those fucking small pots then flip
them Do not top them in those small pots
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're gonna get tall You just
want that big one glory bud in there put a
[SPEAKER_00]: stick in there to hold up that glory cola
The rest will support itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Either four sevens six fives or nine
threes is the way I would do it If you do
[SPEAKER_00]: the threes don't top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones definitely do top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um One more thing to talk about these
plants are very bug resistant from what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed What I've also noticed is
Jack Herrera crosses and blueberry crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: are both bug resistant We got both of
those in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a lot of bug resistance
something I should mention some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people did report getting A rash from
trimming these trees people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: allergic to hazes and blue dream are also
allergic to this plant I've done an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode all about plant rashes and getting
a rash from trimming Guess what those same
[SPEAKER_00]: people got a rash from trimming this
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something in the blueberry It's
something in the haze something in that is
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them a rash and a histamine
reaction So people were getting hives and
[SPEAKER_00]: an arm rash from trimming this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give you a disclaimer If
the hazes or the blueberry if blue dream
[SPEAKER_00]: gave you a rash this one will from
trimming it Those people can smoke it once
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dried and cured, but they cannot trim
it kind of weird Alright, um, I said I
[SPEAKER_00]: would talk about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is a long podcast,
but you guys should love this phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: There obviously is a blueberry cookies
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the blueberry cookies cross It has
got the blue skittles flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got blue skittles blue raspberries
most of that Wang-a-lang a bling-bling
[SPEAKER_00]: blue flavor comes from the blueberry
cookies It is the wider leaf phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from the Tahoe in the blueberry
cookies There's also a Jack Herrera
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that one's got haze maybe a
little bit of peppermint Maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: sandalwood and skunk those are going to be
the longer Longest finishing phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: there may be a little bit of Jack Maybe a
little bit of lamb's bread in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: spiciness that sandalwood maybe a little
bit of the the lamb's bread coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a lot of Jack Herrera that
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Jack the Ripper phenotype,
which is lemons and rotten fruit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: love it then Ladies and gentlemen,
here's the official name of this strain
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten this far into this podcast
and I haven't told you the name of this
[SPEAKER_00]: strain I'm so good at building Suspense
the name of this cross is the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher Shout out to loving in her eyes
for throwing that name in the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it blueberry butcher I tossed
around a lot of ideas that always Came
[SPEAKER_00]: back to blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to loving in her eyes for a
great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get a pack for show I hope
you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you breed with it, but the blueberry
butcher was named by loving in her eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ripper was a serial killer blueberry
cookies I wanted to maybe name it serial
[SPEAKER_00]: killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may get used for something else Don't
steal it cereal not ser il I a whatever L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got lost there but cereal like
the breakfast cereal killer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway This is blueberry butcher Beautiful
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the phenotype which I
have named the blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the blueberry cookies structure But
the Jack the Ripper rotten mango lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: lime funk red bull smell Alright,
that's a lot of stuff to take in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the blueberry cookies structure It's
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got jagged leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like a classic cannabis
plant if you saw the silhouette you'd go
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the weed they used to put in
pictures like it is fucking photogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: weed It's the blueberry cookie structure
very well supported very stout Some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: others are a little skinny a little wispy
definitely need support the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies dominant structure Will support
itself very very sturdy very stout So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got that stout structure which you're
looking for you want plants that will hold
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves up They could build great big
buds on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want takes popping and
twisting very well Then it's got that Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper rotten mango flavor to it
almost and when I say this flavor people
[SPEAKER_00]: wrinkle up their noses and they cringe but
it smells like a bar trash can a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of fermented funk and vomit along with
a little bit of rotten mango and dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit a Little bit of feet going on a
little bit of baby shit and baby food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds terrible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if you're a cannabis consumer a
cannabis Connoisseur you're going damn I
[SPEAKER_00]: need a fucking bag of that Also,
it's got lemon lime funk and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of red bull Or chewable Flintstones
vitamins the purple color to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific the dinos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are So that is the blueberry
butcher phenotype Specifically that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one I'm after a lot of times people want
to talk about phenotypes and like what
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that you like I I'm telling
you which one I like but I want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this and find the phenotype That
blows your mind who cares if that girl
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in your garden Find the girl that
makes find that blueberry butcher that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you happy find the Jack the Ripper
phenotype that you love Find the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: is for you, but that is the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the blueberry butcher It's
got the structure of the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the potency The blueberry cookies
is kind of it'll put you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you think weird But then the
Jack the Ripper comes in and adds to that
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just fucking lifts your head up It
pulls the rug out from underneath you and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, where are my keys?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like they're in your hand,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we park and you're like you're
Parked bro, and it's one of those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love it So there is another
phenotype that is not as common but does
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the purple butcher It's not as potent
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that psychedelia to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more sedative It'll lay you the fuck
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finishes super early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shorter plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a squat of your bushier plant It's
really easy to find early on in the cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: when you see those big fat leaves and the
plant that does Grow tall the others will
[SPEAKER_00]: take off on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get almost a fishing pole thing if
you don't have enough light They'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: tall if it's short squatty and makes up at
the nodes where the nodes meet the branch
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a little extra I don't even
know what to call it not webbing but a
[SPEAKER_00]: little extra callous looking spot Somebody
will tell me what that technical term is
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I've mentioned that I don't know
what that's called It looks like instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of the branch is just coming out They've
got a little extra suction making them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more sturdy a little A lot of those
phenotypes will end up being the shortier
[SPEAKER_00]: squat phenotype that makes purple buds
those purple buds they smell like Lavender
[SPEAKER_00]: and lemons and those have that chewable
vitamin and dirty feet and elderberries is
[SPEAKER_00]: it elderberries that may be There's an
aroma that I'm thinking of an older
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin from the health food store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's elderberries Yep, it's elderberries
and something else purple from the health
[SPEAKER_00]: food store and those chewable fucking
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it smells like I can taste it
and smell it in my mouth right now
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender lilacs elderberries Elderberry
tea with honey in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and Flintstones vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a purple phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Those are the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the blueberry cookies phenotype
that tastes like blue skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the wider leaves It's kind of got
that Tahoe going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the jack hair phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hazy sandalwood skunk That's gonna be
a long finisher the jack the ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype will be kind of a quick finisher
Not as long as that jack hair finisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lemons and rotten fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got the blueberry butcher That is
the blue cookie structure with that mango
[SPEAKER_00]: the wango tango lemon lime Red bull and
vitamin sort of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's that purple one, which in my
opinion isn't the desirable phenotype But
[SPEAKER_00]: it will pop up if you got the clientele
that's into purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one will pay the bills for you there
All of the phenotypes I recommend you top
[SPEAKER_00]: them You'll see where to top them if
you're not good at topping plants this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will tell you top me here It'll make
a nice bottom and the one will just shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: up right out of the top and you'll go
That's the fucking thing that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out Follow it down until it looks
like you got a nice even canopy and take
[SPEAKER_00]: that bitch right out of there Clone that
top because they make beautiful clones
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant clones Very very easily some of
it some of its assets and features
[SPEAKER_00]: Attributes will give you a headache that
cloning part simple as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll clone so easily for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Expect around 70 days finishing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people told me they went 82 days Some
people said they did 65 and really wish
[SPEAKER_00]: they had gone longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let it go 70 72 days check those
trichomes It is all about the trichomes as
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say some people went 82 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So There are 80 day phenotypes in these
packs of seeds you guys I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit you the blueberry butcher can go
up to 82 days, but it puts out Giant
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest weights people were bragging about
how much they pulled off their test
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the test plants were banging out
produce production usable weight
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable weight Also, it is highly
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said potent my voice cut out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take another drink All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, who knows where I'm gonna add it
most of these phenotypes will put out
[SPEAKER_00]: great harvest weights and most of them
will be Ridiculously potent all the photos
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw all the plants were just coated in
trichomes Maybe I'll scroll a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: photos through right here, but they were
all coated in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smelled amazing super potent big
fat Harvest super great bag appeal and a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That is the blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to Everybody who
