[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 94 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you on a beautiful Thursday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got done working at the spot
dispensary for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot as shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in the spot testing out the air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a little bit of construction
and some rebuilding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were testing everything out today,
putting in some work, putting in some
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are ever in southern Colorado,
if you're in the Pueblo, Colorado or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo West area, please stop by the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop in if you need some cannabis,
if you need some hash, if you need some
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, if you need some topicals,
we would love to see you at the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the podcast, drop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them that you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask if I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am there and I'm not busy,
they may call me from the back and I may
[SPEAKER_00]: come out and shake your hand and say
hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just kind of depends on who's working
and who's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're able to do that, they'll come
get me and I'll come say hi to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I've got a bunch of great stuff to
talk about today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to talk about my
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I got to see my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know me, you know that my
favorite band is Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see two Fish shows over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Saturday and Sunday night at the
Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce
[SPEAKER_00]: City, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday was a pretty good show,
but Sunday was a really spectacular show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did some great songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did stuff they haven't played in
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band sounded great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crowd was in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that kind of sucked,
and it didn't suck really, but my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: song from Fish, I think my favorite song
is called Punch You in the Eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the middle section of Punch You in the
Eye is a jam that has been labeled The
[SPEAKER_00]: Landlady.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Landlady was written first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch You in the Eye was written.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Landlady was dropped into the middle
of Punch You in the Eye as the groove
[SPEAKER_00]: portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always been played as one piece
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Sunday night, they opened with The
Landlady, which is the middle section of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite song.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a little disappointing knowing
that I wasn't going to hear my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: song through the whole weekend,
but it was OK because they made up for it
[SPEAKER_00]: by playing some, like I said, some old
songs that I haven't heard in a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff that they have not played in
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody here is a Fish fan,
they played Harpua.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Fish fan, they don't play
Harpua very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do play Harpua, it's a
really great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enough rambling about the Fish
concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put on a hell of a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the end of the summer tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played A Day in the Life by The
Beatles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played Talking Heads cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played After Midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody I met on the Fish
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to advertise the podcast to a couple
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to those folks if you're
listening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to Danielle for being a
great fishing companion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enough ranting about Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we got a new comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be two new comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if I read this one or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to head to iTunes right quick
and we will read this comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we're going to get right
into some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read these comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment comes from Eden 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was left August 27th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a good chance I've read this,
but I take a lot of dabs on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a chance I did not read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, educated and entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate how organized and articulate
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love your hippie love attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to the college level
grow lessons you promised for episode 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I read that because I remember
reading the college grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised those won't be on episode 100,
but they will after one episode 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do kind of plan on kicking up the
education level on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone kind of the intro level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had your introductory courses from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to all 90
something episodes, it's time for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: step up your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start learning a little
bit more in depth shit after episode 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friend Eden 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: You left a sweet comment and you gave me
five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did what you were told.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing fucking cooler than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from our friend teacher from
Philly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says five stars from Philly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment was left September 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been listening for a while
now and I have some experience with your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dropping a message to let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says teacher from Philly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate any type of teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how it is to be a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of work and dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to say thank you for noticing
and thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I would love it if you left a
comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
search for girl from your heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: click on it, go to the review section,
give me a five star review and then type
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will read your comment on a future
episode, just like I did these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to Eden 2013 and teacher
from Philly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate those comments you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few news articles I want to
read, but a lot of you guys are out there
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking some cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are hitting the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are maybe eating some edibles
or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do, I want to do a dab with
everybody right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not able to take a dab,
if you're listening to this podcast in
[SPEAKER_00]: your cubicle or in the shop or in your car
and you're unable to take a fat dab right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, then this dab that I'm about to take
is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're somewhere where you're able to
take a dab, I want you to get a dab ready
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want you to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start getting it ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the email, so I'm already hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got to do is get it ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I'm getting a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a nice chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I smoking here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am smoking some candy kush, some
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real nice and amber-y, real clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real, real shattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put some of this on the
dab right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've almost got it ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want you guys to start heating your
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually takes somewhere between 10 and
20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need more time, I'm going to let
you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of trying to hesitate,
but it's hard to hesitate on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about dab time you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting the rig up to my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody listening to take a dab
with me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a big group dab,
and then we're going to read some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cannot take a dab, all of us
that are dabbing are thinking about all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that are at work or wherever
they are on the bus, in a taxi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an Uber, you can probably
smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Uber drivers don't give a shit if you
smoke out their Uber ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in an Uber, you have no
excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get down on a bowl, get down on a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this on the count of six,
four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like about a half gram dab of some Candy
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare when I cough from a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to take like a serious dab or the
water's got to be murky or something's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to go wrong if I'm going to cough from a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody got to take a dab with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you weren't able to take a
dab, I hope you're feeling the dab that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just took.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're feeling the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're feeling the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys for joining
me for a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about some news articles
and I've been rambling for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's open up these news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to just for a disclaimer,
I know that earlier in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a past episode, I said that I was going
to get more into grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a CBD episode coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few episodes in the works that
are partial episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking notes and getting shit ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been so much news that I
feel it's my responsibility to bring this
[SPEAKER_00]: news to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here comes the first news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this article on the cannabis and
it was written by John Murray of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says Denver social pot use
plans are getting overhauled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sub headline says the idea isn't dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backers of the proposal say they will join
talks with city and business leaders to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to work out a compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activists behind a proposed Denver ballot
initiative to allow some marijuana use in
[SPEAKER_00]: bars and other businesses say they will
pull the measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Denver Post has confirmed their new
goal, crafting a compromise measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: With city and business leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The verbal agreement with the group that
includes city attorney, Scott Martinez,
[SPEAKER_00]: averts a public vote in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that might have allowed more extensive
pot consumption in publicly accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: places than city officials and some
business leaders were comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason Tivert of the marijuana policy
project said fellow backers of the limited
[SPEAKER_00]: social cannabis use initiative plan to
announce the withdrawal Thursday before
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday's expected certification of the
measure for the November 3rd ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activists now will shift to working with
city officials and the state restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: and lodging associations to work out an
ordinance that they hope will be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered by the Denver council or by the
city council, excuse me, within the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downtown Denver partnership,
which represents business interests in
[SPEAKER_00]: that area, also plans to take part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not approaching the withdrawal of
this initiative lightly said Tivert,
[SPEAKER_00]: who also was a co-author of Colorado's
marijuana legalizing amendment 64 in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that cannabis users deserve the
freedom and, let me try that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe that cannabis users deserve the
freedom to congregate and socialize to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same extent as alcohol users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I'm gonna interject here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we set up this cannabis system that
we have, the whole model that they modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: it after was to make it like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to regulate it like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to go to so many places and
drink alcohol all night long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't there a few places for us to go
and take some dabs and smoke some flies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And hang out with our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always have to be at my house
sitting at the dab table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many stoners out there that I
don't know because they're all at their
[SPEAKER_00]: house on their couch taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they don't come to my house and sit
on my couch and take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're never gonna meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had a social club, we'd go meet each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way when somebody got tired of
smoking, what am I smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got tired of smoking candy Kush,
I could go trade them my candy Kush for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their OG Kush or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just make a nice little community,
a nice little network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna keep on with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, they found ready support in the
ballot petitioning process turning in
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,700 signatures, more than twice as many
as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Denver police have shut down
private cannabis clubs, the city's
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana policy office this year began
examining as an evolving regulatory need
[SPEAKER_00]: to the potential of allowing some social
use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea came up in council races last
spring with some successful candidates
[SPEAKER_00]: open to the idea in part because tourists
lack places to consume their purchases
[SPEAKER_00]: legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come to Colorado and if you're not
from here, if you've got an out of state
[SPEAKER_00]: license, you can purchase up to seven
grams of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can purchase up to seven grams of
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can purchase seven grams total in any
combination of edibles, hash, tinctures
[SPEAKER_00]: and topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can't do once you've made the
purchase, there's nowhere to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go to the hotel and smoke
because they don't allow smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go to the park because that's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you know somebody, you just have
all this cannabis that you can't smoke and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not allowed to take it to your home
state to smoke it because it's illegal to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel across state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this smoking lounge type
of an environment is something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: But city efforts were in early stages when
Tavert and Brian Vicente of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-focused law firm Vicente
Sitterberg, both frustrated with what they
[SPEAKER_00]: saw as inaction, began to push for the
initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tavert and several people involved in the
recent talk say it's too soon to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: what will result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Options could range from a narrow
ordinance that allows private clubs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: more extensive law that would break new
ground in Colorado by allowing patrons of
[SPEAKER_00]: some bars to vape inside or smoke outside,
as the initiative proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initiative withdrawal ensures we now
have the time and ability to include all
[SPEAKER_00]: interested stakeholders to reach consensus
on this important issue, said Councilman
[SPEAKER_00]: Albus Brooks, who represents most of
downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm committed to working on a broadly
acceptable solution, but finding common
[SPEAKER_00]: ground for an expansion of the current
law, which restricts consumption mostly to
[SPEAKER_00]: private residents, might prove tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the chance that a consensus
proposal won't go far enough for the
[SPEAKER_00]: activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Mayor Michael Hancock's
administration took no position on the
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed initiative, the city attorney's
office questioned the legality of its
[SPEAKER_00]: scope, given state laws against public
consumption that its lawyers viewed as
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sonia Riggs, president and CEO of the
Colorado Restaurant Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed adamant opposition on behalf of
about half of the state's restaurants,
[SPEAKER_00]: in part based on concerns that insurers
might drop coverage of all restaurants
[SPEAKER_00]: because of liability concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, the Colorado Hotel and Lodging
Association, Metro Denver Lodging Council,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Colorado Restaurant Association said
in a statement that they appreciated the
[SPEAKER_00]: activists' withdrawal of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our respective industries are committed to
working with the proponents and the city
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a solution that reflects the
interests and concerns of all
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholders, their statement said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposed initiative divided Denver
restaurant and bar owners who would have
[SPEAKER_00]: had the option to allow marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riggs said Wednesday that she would
approach the discussion with an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand there's a concern from
their part that they need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: addressed, she said of initiative backers,
just as there's a concern from our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: For their part, city officials say they
can't offer assurances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also plan to gather input from
neighborhood and community groups on the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't guarantee an outcome on it,
obviously, but it's something we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at, said Ashley Kilroy,
Hancock's executive director for marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do believe that there's area for a
conversation around this and that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of other considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martina said his office isn't drawing
bright lines, allowing policymakers to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider all options first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to throw down the legal
hammer until we are specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until there are specific proposals,
he said, adding, we are all working to
[SPEAKER_00]: find clarity within the law so that people
can operate with certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If activists are dissatisfied with the
coming decisions, though, they will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fallback option, going back to the ballot
on their own next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a presidential election that probably
will have wider turnout than this fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tavert sees an even greater change for
passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said a successful compromise with
city officials and other interests as more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to result in a law that we know the
city would be comfortable with and will
[SPEAKER_00]: not resist and will actually implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pulled their ballot so that they
can rewrite it to where they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a little bit more fair for the
businesses and for the people who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the law or the proposal is not dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to rewrite it and they're
going to try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the city of Denver wants to
work with the cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like they understand the revenue
that is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand the need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they mentioned in this article that
out of staters don't have anywhere to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume, which is the main problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those out of staters had somewhere to
consume, they would go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would consume and then they're going
to get hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get thirsty and they're
going to need entertainment, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause them or not cause them,
but yeah, will cause them to go spend more
[SPEAKER_00]: money and participate in our economy and
be part of our state's cash flow a little
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I got to go blow my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm catching a little bit of a head cold,
but I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if my voice sounds a little
bit nasally this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am catching a little bit of a head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to fight it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like any other professional,
the show must go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing the podcast and making the
best of it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys for tolerating my
little bit of sniffles and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a nasally voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another news article
here for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is grounds for celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may become a holiday in Colorado if
they continue to do this annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article here came from The Cannabis
and it was written by Kristen Wyatt from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline says, get ready for the
one day tax holiday on Colorado weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, guys, I got to take a drink
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll get the show on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the sub headline says,
we're thinking there will be huge crowds,
[SPEAKER_00]: says a shop owner about the September 16
break on the hefty Colorado marijuana tax
[SPEAKER_00]: on recreational weed, thanks to the Tabor
Law.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that sounds confusing to a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taxes are ridiculously high on
cannabis here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have a one day tax free
cannabis day in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's unusual tax laws forcing the
state to suspend taxes on recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sales tax break on September 16th will
save $20 off the prices of a mid grade
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of pot in the Denver area,
where ounces this summer sell for about
[SPEAKER_00]: $200 before tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unusual for a state that has many
times rejected sales tax holidays on
[SPEAKER_00]: things like school supplies, clothing,
or any energy efficient appliances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials say it could cost the state
three to $4 million in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they're going to lose three to
$4 million in taxes in a single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, at first I was
in disbelief we were doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Sherry Hackett, who owns Botanicare,
a dispensary in the Denver suburb of North
[SPEAKER_00]: Glen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, that's Botana care,
not Botanicare, the nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two separate businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once our lawyer said, no, we really are
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started getting ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking there will be huge crowds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hackett is printing signs to alert
customers to the holiday and is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: boost inventory for a one day crush of
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's taxpayer bill of rights
requires voter approval for new taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, a year after legalizing
recreational pot, voters approved the 25%
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, but the law requires that any new
taxes be waived and refunded if overall
[SPEAKER_00]: state collections exceed projections given
to voters when they approved the new
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the pot taxes were projected
to raise $70 million in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually raised $58 million,
but because overall tax collections that
[SPEAKER_00]: year exceeded projections, Colorado must
ask voters for permission to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they comply with the requirement that
the taxes revert to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawmakers settled on a short one day tax
waiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day is September 16th, one day after
the state's books for the previous fiscal
[SPEAKER_00]: year are made final.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you guys want to come to
Colorado and buy a quarter of cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: a shop, September 16th would be your day
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana won't be completely tax free
that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular 2.9% sales tax still applies as
do medical marijuana taxes and the local
[SPEAKER_00]: pot taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the extra local taxes that
we pay here in Pueblo will still be tacked
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pot retailers, the holiday poses a
bizarre supply dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll want plenty of weed on hand to
sell to throngs of pot shoppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if they stock too much product,
they'll forego their one day waiver on the
[SPEAKER_00]: 15% excise tax they pay marijuana
wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A savvy retailer would want to have
shelves full enough to supply crowds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but bare enough to take maximum advantage
of the restocking without paying excise
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes before the business closes September
16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Fox, who owns two Denver dispensaries
and also a wholesale pot growing company,
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't decided what sorts of deals to
offer that day, but he's anticipating a
[SPEAKER_00]: windfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hopes are high and we're going to push
as hard as we can to see as many customers
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can, Fox said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado voters will decide in November
whether to keep the pot taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 2013 taxing measure passed two to one
and state politicians seemed confident
[SPEAKER_00]: voters will reauthorize the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state constitution requires refunds
only in a new taxes first year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so voters won't be asked again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I read that a little weird,
so I'm going to read that last line again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the state constitution requires
refunds only in a new taxes first year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so voters won't be asked again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of read that funny the first time,
but this only comes up when a tax is in
[SPEAKER_00]: its first year, so they won't be asking us
this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one day tax break won't put too much
of a dent in the state's overall pot
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's pot collection are blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana tax revenues jumped from $25
million in the first five months of 2014
[SPEAKER_00]: to $44 million in the first five months of
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The increase has been attributed to
additional stores opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado now has 380 recreational pot
dispensaries and 480 licensed recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: pot growers, up from a few dozen in the
state's first months of retail
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, those 480 recreational
growers are actually commercial grows that
[SPEAKER_00]: only vend two dispensaries, recreational
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not include private grows,
so there are a lot more private grows that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, we made so much tax money
that we have to give our state a tax
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the customers that come to buy
cannabis on September 16th will not have
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay the regular cannabis tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come from out of state,
we hope to see you at the spot dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: on September 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come from out of state,
if you come from anywhere, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: ask for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to come out from the back and
say, hi, shake your hand and see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be at work on September 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't come to say hi to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing Morgan Heritage and Damien
Marley and Taurus Riley on September 15th,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a good chance I will not show
up for work on the 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy your tax-free day without me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another news article to read to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going...
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get two news articles in in the next
10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article, I've got two articles
that I'm going to read back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came out on September 8th,
and then the next article came out shortly
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out on September 9th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are related articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and get into the
first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is once again from The Cannabis,
written by David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says,
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday's recall was ordered by the Denver
Department of Environmental Health and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division,
following a story by The Post that
[SPEAKER_00]: revealed lab tests detected three
unapproved pesticides in a pair of Mahatma
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The test commissioned by The Post found
levels of, oh gosh, myclobutanil and
[SPEAKER_00]: imidacloripid in Mahatma's black label
grapefruit diesel wax that were six times
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum amount allowed by federal
government on any food product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticides also were found in
Mahatma's black label alpha blue shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at lower levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurable amounts of avamectin were found
in both samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only Mahatma products showing an origin
number of 403-00114 on their labels are
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to the recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unclear how many products with that
origin number were sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mouser said he is preparing to handle
returned products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold placards were placed on locked
storage units for when recalled product
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back into Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told The Post in an email, Once product
reaches us on this recall, we will be
[SPEAKER_00]: sending it out for testing, and once
results are back and show passed,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the product will be released from the
City of Denver's hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If product does not pass, we will be
quarantining and contacting the Med for
[SPEAKER_00]: further instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday's actions are part of a supply
chain investigation, according to Dan
[SPEAKER_00]: Rowland, spokesman for Denver's Office of
Marijuana Policy, adding that additional
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspectors visited Mahatma's facilities
and poured through records and products.
[SPEAKER_00]: An owner at Treatments, which also
operates Altitude the Dispensary shops in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, said he expects agency inspectors
to visit his facility on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides typically are applied while a
plant is growing, not after it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested, dried, and sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Post's investigation found Mahatma had
inadvertently mislabeled its products to
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate the concentrate came from plants
it had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticides were not included in the
product's labels list of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: State law requires labels to reflect any
pesticide or herbicide or contaminant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was used at any stage of a marijuana
product's processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the law also requires cannabis
businesses to test for pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: that provision has not yet been enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mouser previously said the business's
labels are only as accurate as the
[SPEAKER_00]: information provided to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going by what our clients give us,
as far as an ingredient list, he told the
[SPEAKER_00]: Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go over the ingredients list,
and we check that list again against the
[SPEAKER_00]: approved pesticides list.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we find something that isn't on the
list, we notify the processing client.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticides found in the Post's tests
are among hundreds, if Colorado Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Agriculture has not approved for use on
marijuana because product labels restrict
[SPEAKER_00]: their use to certain plant and crops or to
specific locations, such as open fields
[SPEAKER_00]: and residential gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because marijuana is illegal under federal
law, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Protection Agency will not
certify any pesticide for use on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor allow any testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, there are no safety limits
established for their use specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or their ingestion by consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the products are allowed on other
consumable items, such as strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, and grapes, though the level of
pesticide residues allowed on each does
[SPEAKER_00]: vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Post found pesticides levels as much
as six times the highest amount allowed on
[SPEAKER_00]: an edible food product, and as high as
1,800 times the level Denver officials
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to be on released plants it had
quarantined earlier this year over
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant had 1,800 times the level that
Denver allowed to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant had been sprayed to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever material they used, these guys
were spraying the fuck out of it all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and way too concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of bugs they were
trying to treat for, but they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: quality farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go on with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says enforcement of the state's list of
allowable pesticides is sporadic at best,
[SPEAKER_00]: with most city and state officials
responding to complaints rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: inspecting each facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado had about five years of medical
marijuana cultivation and sales before the
[SPEAKER_00]: state in 2013 began compiling a list of
which pesticides could be used on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials admit that reflects an imperfect
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's marijuana czar, Andrew
Friedman, said the state is dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem as best it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers are new to regulated
pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, like banking, the pesticide
regulatory system is heavily built on
[SPEAKER_00]: federal involvement, said Friedman,
director of Governor John Hickenlooper's
[SPEAKER_00]: Office of Marijuana Coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not a completely satisfying
answer, and honestly, I wish we had these
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges solved by day one, but we're
working toward an enforceable solution
[SPEAKER_00]: that also protects consumers from other
contaminants such as molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, they are trying to keep the
cannabis safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're testing it now to find out what is
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are figuring out what pesticides we
should and should not be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are setting levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are trying to keep the consumer safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taken this out of the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have put it into the store,
and now we're putting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this shows that Colorado is doing
our best to make a legitimate business out
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a commercial product that's being
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am impressed, but at the same time,
I'm bummed out that there are well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like Mahatma that are still
screwing it up and mislabeling and making
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahatma has won cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done business with Mahatma,
and they've always been super kind to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a little disappointing to see an
industry leader come out and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get their shit together,
and like they said, they were only going
[SPEAKER_00]: by the labels that they were given by the
growers, so that was probably not their
[SPEAKER_00]: fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go ahead and give them the
benefit of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahatma didn't do this on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just going off of labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next article is completely related to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this testing and pesticide
testing and safety inspections have all
[SPEAKER_00]: stemmed from a few small incidents,
but it has sparked a lot of investigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is going to improve our industry,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read another article that
came out the day after the last article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says,
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pretty much a follow-up of the
last article I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again by David Magoya and Ricardo
Baca, and the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado agriculture officials have opened
an investigation into a marijuana grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation named in a report by the Denver
Post about pesticide residues,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they confirmed a second business named
in the story was already under scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is unclear which of the two companies
Mahatma concentrates or Treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlimited, both in Denver, was already
under scrutiny, and officials with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Department of Agriculture would
not elaborate, but the agency said
[SPEAKER_00]: investigations into other businesses' use
of pesticides is the focus of its probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDA has one ongoing investigation with
one of the growers, and based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: information supplied in the article,
we have opened a second investigation into
[SPEAKER_00]: the other named grower to determine if
their pesticide use is in compliance with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado Pesticide Applicators Act,
CDA spokeswoman Christy Lightcap said in
[SPEAKER_00]: an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although laws require marijuana businesses
to test for pesticide residues,
[SPEAKER_00]: that rule has not been enforced because
only one facility is certified to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
rules show marijuana that tests positive
[SPEAKER_00]: for unapproved pesticides and other
contaminants must be destroyed or
[SPEAKER_00]: decontaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The post on Tuesday reported that two of
eight lab tests it commissioned on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana extracts found three unapproved
pesticides and products made by Mahatma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Mahatma labels indicated the
tainted marijuana used to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts came from its own grow facility,
documents showed the cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_00]: came from Treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Treatments co-owner admitted that the
company had used products that contained
[SPEAKER_00]: the unapproved pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatments, which operates a pair of
Altitude the Dispensary shops in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of 11 marijuana growers to have
about 100,000 plants quarantined earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: this year by Denver health officials over
pesticide concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city allowed most of the plants back
into commerce, including those grown by
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatments, when levels of pesticide
residues dropped to the lowest amount
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed on food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two other businesses destroyed the plants
rather than wait for pesticide test
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: CDA's announcement on Wednesday came a day
after the Denver Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Health issued a broad recall
of Mahatma products following a visit to
[SPEAKER_00]: that shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspectors were expected to be at
Treatments Growing Warehouse on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retailers with recalled products were
instructed to remove them from store
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves and either destroy the products in
compliance with MED regulations or return
[SPEAKER_00]: the products to the manufacturer,
said Dan Rowland, spokesman for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver's Office of Marijuana Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers should either destroy any
recalled product they have or return it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store of purchase, Rowland said.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information of potential pesticide
misuse is concerning, LightCap said in an
[SPEAKER_00]: announcing investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDA has identified a list of products
that can be used on marijuana and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: available to growers for well over one
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides on marijuana is a controversial
topic because no science exists to say
[SPEAKER_00]: which products are safe for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although several pesticides are approved,
for use on some fruit and vegetable crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Protection Agency cannot say
whether they are safe on marijuana because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: CDA has compiled a list of pesticides,
some of them so non-toxic that they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: require federal registration that can be
used on marijuana based on their label
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions, not on their safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a violation of federal law to use
any pesticide contrary to its label
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: CDA has chosen those products whose label
restrictions were so broad that using them
[SPEAKER_00]: on marijuana would not be in violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CDA officials have constantly said
they do not recommend using pesticides on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, nor will they say those
products that appear on its list of
[SPEAKER_00]: approved pesticides are safe to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a completely new business here
and we're building a space shuttle that
[SPEAKER_00]: has not been done anywhere else,
Colorado Agricultural Commissioner Don
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states, including New Hampshire,
have restricted pesticides allowed on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana only to those so non-toxic that
federal registration is not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado nearly did the same, but the
industry argued that non-toxic pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly organics such as neem, cinnamon,
and peppermint oils, weren't nearly strong
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to combat effectively the pests and
mildews that most commonly attack their
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm kind of torn by pesticides
because I run a commercial grow and we
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot lose a million dollar harvest to
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to do something to keep bugs
off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with this last statement here that
organics such as neem oil, cinnamon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and peppermint oils, and rosemary oil is
something, and cedar oil is also something
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those oils are great as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are wonderful on a small scale grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, those types of oils will
end up in your concentrate just like all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste neem oil in your dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray neem oil on your plants early
before flower or just before flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: early into flower, I can taste the neem
oil in your extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I had some dabs given to me by an
artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted me to sample them and I could
taste the rosemary oil in his concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using essential oils isn't always the
cure, the end-all, the preventative,
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to use some type of a
pesticide, especially when you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I find I get the bugs the
most often is when I get a clone as a gift
[SPEAKER_00]: from another grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost always has some kind of a bug on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get a new clone, that's when I
treat with, I use heavy shit depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what the clone is and what bugs I see on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will use some pretty radical
treatment because I cannot risk my mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants getting spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot risk my mother plants getting
broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rely on my mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent years developing those mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If bugs destroyed those, oh, I would be
devastated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do understand the need for a little
bit of a stronger pesticide in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I have recently started
doing, I am studying for a Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture pesticide applicator's test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anybody that is spraying
pesticides in any type of a garden should
[SPEAKER_00]: have to at least examine this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be training new employees on
pesticide safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm required to take this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage anybody who's going to
play with pesticides to take this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will teach you a lot about pesticides
safety to start with, how to handle a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide, how to apply a pesticide
safely, what to wear when you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will also teach you what is in
almost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few chemicals that they're
using in all these brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just different brands with
different labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same chemical in almost
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you learn what chemicals kill which
bugs, it makes your job a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend studying up on this
pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to your state's Department of
Agriculture website and see if there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who does a job like an
exterminator or something like that has to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's available in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help you combat your pest problems a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will also keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point with these articles is that we
are not screwing around here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually testing products to make
sure that things are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have stepped up our game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see a lot of businesses fall
apart because of all this new regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: with pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the growers that think they are
master growers and pro growers are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to know what to do once they start
getting rid of some of the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to start using an
integrated pest management system with
[SPEAKER_00]: live insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a whole different ball
game pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write that down because that
sounds like a good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a good episode idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, now I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about integrated pest
management on a whole other episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing a note of that.
IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get Sean over to talk about
organic integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long I've been talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been going for at least
35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys like to listen to about 36
minutes worth of show before you get
[SPEAKER_00]: bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time for me to wrap up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys listening to
me, especially today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of a stuffy nose,
so I'm sure my voice is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: nasally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate you for sticking
through this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to all the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back on Monday with another
episode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting together the CBD episode I've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting together three or four
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all here in this notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, now we're going to talk about
integrated pest management in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I say at the end of the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that part about going to iTunes,
go into the iTunes store, search for Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast and give me a five
star rating and type in a review and let
[SPEAKER_00]: me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people that give the show a
rating and a good review, the more people
[SPEAKER_00]: see the show, the more people see the
show, the more people start growing better
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the more people that are growing
better cannabis, which means the more
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis is available,
which means weed will get cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone will be able to smoke cheaper
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all have an abundance of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just share the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go click like on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people will listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe one day you'll be somewhere
and somebody will smoke some weed with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be like, where'd you learn to
grow this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, I listened to that
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd be like, damn, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everyone will have great weed
because of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running out of breath.

media sites.

[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give a big, huge shout out
to my ninja Spence.
