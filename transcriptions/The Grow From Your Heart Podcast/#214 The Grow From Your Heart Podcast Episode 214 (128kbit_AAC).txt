podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode number 45 of the I Grow
Culture podcast, the podcast all about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, a pro grower,
a long-time cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: a brand new smoker, or just someone who's
curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hanging out over to my left here is our
good buddy, King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I started to choke right as I tried
to introduce you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stumbled there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a big giant dab, and it took
about a minute to kick in, and it happened
[SPEAKER_01]: to be right at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, turn on the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to yell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the table is Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all red-eyed, and you got drywall
dust in your hair and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like a working man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less video games, more working lately,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're even getting all rough and
tumbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rough and tumbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is the holiday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever winter holiday it is that you
celebrate, this will be your episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Merry Holiday, whichever one you
choose to label it as.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to judge you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I support all of your holiday decisions,
whatever religion, race, creed you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you have a great winter holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you get a lot of gifts if you're
into the gift-giving thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you give a lot of gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you give twice as many gifts as you
receive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bah humbug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not into the holiday thing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we try to change that for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we give you gifts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give your kids some gifts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten gifts that blow my mind in the
past couple of years, but it's always like
[SPEAKER_01]: now I feel obligated because I'm an adult
and that's the proper thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that that's not what it
was about, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we just hold you down?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we just hold you down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bender is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bender's a great and kind person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bender hooked you up with a fat gift and
now you feel fucked because you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are able to give out kind
gifts like that to our friends that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know can't give a gift like that,
we do it because we know that you want
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit and that you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't expect anything in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fucking play with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to throw that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our buddy Bender gave Adam, can I say
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave you a graphics card for your
computer and you're going to love it,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to see you smiling and all
shitted and giggled and you're playing
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't about you giving him back a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cheer up and fucking enjoy the holidays
with us or we'll hold you down and tickle
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try with the kids, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going to make you feel when two
grown men hold you down and tickle you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been tickled as a grown man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not since I left Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just took an awkward turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to put it back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to mention something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned this the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes sent me an email and they say that
there will be a delay in podcast posting
[SPEAKER_01]: between December 22nd and January 5th,
which will affect this episode and
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will post them early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're recording on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show comes out on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to put it up like Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully that'll give iTunes time to
do whatever it is they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why they choose to do that
around Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love it early.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can love it early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if it makes it, it may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to remind you guys,
we're going to change the name of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, I said December 1st,
but I was high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start calling it the Grow
From Your Heart podcast because iGrow is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a horticulture agricultural
educational institution that does not want
[SPEAKER_01]: me associating their name with our beloved
sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before they send me a cease and desist
letter, I'm just going to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the responsible thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to rip off anybody else's
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody else was called iGrow culture,
I'd be pissed off about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they were called iRegenetics,
I'd be double pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to be fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very noble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to move your mic closer to you,
but you've got that beautiful hitman rig
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of you that you grabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get that at the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is sexy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't write down any space for you to
ramble about the Emerald Cup, but do you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to tell us about your experience for
a second?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Emerald Cup was a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd highly recommend all growers to try to
make it out to that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best cup I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge thing to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as tongue in cheek as the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not stereotypical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less of an RV show and more of a
growers music kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in Santa Rosa, California,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you flew out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hang out with Baka a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and him went out there together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Baka.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's never gotten a shout out on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, James?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sending you some love, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope we get to dab sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the growers are hard to get in one
room together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like we went to Cali and it's
like for four days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds great, but four days for growers
and eternity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still trying to recover from that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that third day you're like going,
I wonder if everything's alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder you won the flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I just want to, can you just
fly over my house?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to, come on, I want to see if
it burned down or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're always got the worst
ideas in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam, you've been working a lot,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you working on, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some grow up buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, is it the one that we talked about
last?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so for the whole Denver Bud Company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver Bud Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are still putting that together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how many lights are going in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: More, a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: More than a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 55 to 75 per unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to give exact units,
but it's still single digit units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting in the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nothing there and the guy that
was there doing it was there all alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't know if you've ever
tried to do construction all alone,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really do a lot of construction
by yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just slow cutting and doing and
cutting and doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measure twice, cut once, nail it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measure twice, cut once, and then you need
someone to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier if you've got someone to help
you hold the shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When he told me, I literally laughed at
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we, you know, it's a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't bitch and hopefully it holds out
through the end of the month because I
[SPEAKER_01]: really needed the stuff for the kids and
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's good timing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good Christmas check.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of busy today myself,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I want to give a big shout out to
my homie, Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence and I have been talking about me
learning how to make dabs because I smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of hash and I grow my own herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sufficient all the way from,
I can create my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can germinate and I can grow the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can trim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've got the product that is done as
flowers and trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I like to smoke dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to learn how to turn that into
the dabs I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Spence spent about four or five
hours teaching me how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran a couple of batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to run some tubes myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all the way up to the point when
we put it in the vac oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand the vac oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know the controls on the oven
very well myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get that comfortable, I think I can
make pretty good quality shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a batch of my shatter that I
blasted sitting in the vac oven right now
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for me to check it out in about 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence is going to flip it because it's in
his facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm kind of proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go from seed to shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go all the way from the germination
all the way to my dabber now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know about congrats yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched and tried once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an experimental process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just trying to learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting out of the comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really, I was comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized I was comfortable for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had irie genetics go and I haven't
done anything for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, I've expanded and learned and
grown, but now I've got this new grow
[SPEAKER_01]: facility with 227 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm learning how to make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely getting out of the comfort
zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's more comfortable than just
blasting a QP like, yeah, let's see what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw down three ounces of your favorite
lemon Jeffrey and just run it and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My forearms are a little, there's a lot of
work involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy as you might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of me making dabs, this podcast
is brought to you by our good friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using high quality concentrates
made by Rasta Jeff or Garden of Weeden,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even this water hash solvent list,
what do you call it Sean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full melt hash that Sean made and brought
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff is tasty and dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You deserve a high quality titanium nail
that's made right here in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made in Provo, Utah by our good
friend Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trust a cheap Chinese nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trust an American knockoff made of
cheap crappy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust the industry leader, the innovator,
the kings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust our good friends Highly Educated
Titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out HighlyEducatedTI
.com for more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to buy yourself a Highly
Educated product, or if you want to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else a Highly Educated Titanium
gift, you should head to
[SPEAKER_01]: AqualabTechnologies.com right now and
place your order and get that Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: gift in for your favorite dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every dabber would like a brand
new titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a nail that'll fit your 14 and
your 18 millimeter rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got one that'll fit your 10,
your 11, and your 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a carb cap to go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would make anybody at this
table pretty happy if you got a nail and a
[SPEAKER_01]: carb cap in the mail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See everybody looked at me like,
you know, I don't have one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got cool colors now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have cool colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's is kind of, is that purple or would
you call that pink?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one right here is a purple,
so yours is pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's pink though, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got a blue one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm spoiled guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got multiple colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go buy your lady a pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're manly as fuck for carrying that
pink one around with pride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pink torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez, this guy's dick must be huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of big dicks, make sure you check
out HighlyEducatedTitanium.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to give a big thanks to Adams
right in front of me, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You helped me out a whole fucking bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You helped me transplant a large number of
plants and it took us hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our fingernails real dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got sweaty and made these guys listen
to reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got tired and something really
weird happened at The Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blasted Pantera as loud as it would
freaking go for a good album worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really out of character for me,
but it got us pumped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a little bit getting burned out
and that Pantera really got the mosh pit
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the point where there's like,
where's the rest of the work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys knocked it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took the three of us most of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine watching me try to do that
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've said, it's a learning process for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to do a couple quick ads and
then we'll keep this going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep the momentum going in
the conversation.

huge shout out to Maddie.

[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the The Girl Scout Cookies crossed to
the King Kim Grape Stomper OG and she
[SPEAKER_01]: killed it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie got her own little grow space over
at the Garden of Weedon and she put some
[SPEAKER_01]: of my seeds in there and they look
freaking marvelous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good job, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet them the other weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, it was a pleasure to meet
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smell finally some of the stuff that
I've been looking at Instagram for the
[SPEAKER_01]: past three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to give Jesse a shout out
for a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for letting me and my wife get
out of the house for a change and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, putting me to work so I can pay some
bills for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving though, he invited you to
dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got everybody blazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicated food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I was able to go, it was
wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving was what the phrase was by
the time I wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't giving anymore.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do one more ad because I've
got a lot of cool stuff to say to Sean and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's sitting here patiently twiddling his
carb cap like he wants to hear the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam, do a dab while he does a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a little dab right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's alive right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hook Adam up with one after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got it all taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at treethugger.com, treethugger
[SPEAKER_01]: .com, live music lifestyle magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews, www.treethugger
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go see the string cheese
incident on New Year's Eve for all three
[SPEAKER_01]: nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guarantee there'll be some shit about
that on treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't write it, but I know that that
shit will be up there because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hippies will like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you can put the rig by the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody minds hearing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes them feel like they're there with
us listening to your torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm going to read part of an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all the commercials guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're fast forwarding through
commercials, you could stop right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: just listen to this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to find my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of notes on my phone that
I want to make sure I read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Adam, you got something for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went on the forums the other day and I
was just looking through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like you're getting more response
on the forums as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a dramatic, but when I
logged in, there was only like X amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: users and now there's a little bit more
than double.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been pulled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't say just a little because
every one of those people I'm fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: grateful for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say there's only 63.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say there are fucking 63, yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm making up a number, but I'm
excited for each one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's talking about the iRegenetics
Colorado website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I post a lot of stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been there for like a week
because I got this new job and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of scrambling to get a whole bunch of
shit done before I start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But trust me, I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on that website sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to our good
friend, Jake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jake sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of can't read the whole thing
because of some of the stuff that he says.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of asked me not to say some stuff
that he wrote, but he ends this with,
[SPEAKER_01]: congrats on the new job and keep up the
good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing your part and making my 12
hour shift variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, I am grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big up, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of stuff right there makes the
hours that I put into this show worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes these guys come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean puts part of his day aside to come
here and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam has to break away from his family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's got a construction company,
a grow business, a hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have to break away from their
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hearing these compliments really lets
us know that you're loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it worth it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd do it even if you didn't,
but it really, it's like, yay,
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Jake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome that you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't say the rest of your message
because you said some cool stuff that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got more stuff written down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys want to talk some news real
quick, or do you want me to ask Sean
[SPEAKER_01]: questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean will have an opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give Sean some room to
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's patient and quiet over there,
nice and polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: In local news, I hope you guys have an
opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really cannabis related,
but the Westboro Baptist Church is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: to our town to pick it at our courthouse
and at two local dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming here because our town
supports gay rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a gay woman who is one of our
representatives and she's a cool ass lady
[SPEAKER_01]: and I support her in every way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Westboro Baptist Church wants to
come here and protest us because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: gay rights here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they're done protesting at
our courthouse, they're going to go to two
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and protest over there in
Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flattered you guys are coming,
but fuck off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are our own town.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go worry about your own damn town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just hate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people are fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, no matter what religion
you are, no matter what you believe in,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think be kind and love everybody is what
you're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're being very hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not being kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not loving anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're preaching hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're driving from another, they're
driving from Kansas to come to Colorado to
[SPEAKER_01]: show how angry they are at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize they were that close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like don't you have some shit to do at
home?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't be presumptuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, but I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that while mom and dad are
here protesting that little Jimmy's
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking a joint in Kansas and little
Sarah's getting butt-fucked by Jimmy's
[SPEAKER_01]: older brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely, if not much weirder shit
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's Kansas, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The brother and sister are just getting it
in the living room while the parents are
[SPEAKER_01]: here protesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen their children that they have
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope their kids are getting gay and
smoking weed while they're here
[SPEAKER_01]: protesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching Duck Dynasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching Duck Dynasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching porn, getting gay, smoking weed,
drinking forties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wearing camo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying the N word, but not in a racial
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calling each other the N word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's what your kids are doing
while you're here protesting our town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you get home, it's back to
the polo shirts and yes mama, but I truly
[SPEAKER_01]: am flattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of places for them to go
and they chose here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have gay rights and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just figured they'd run it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running out of places to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be offensive to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the West.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even say the name of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bother me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this one group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just piss me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've said a lot of rude shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wanted to know the name of the
dispensary side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to Marisol is the first one
they listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I took a screenshot of the article
here because that's how I was just saving
[SPEAKER_01]: news on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't take a screenshot of the
article, but I know they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: Marisol and one other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you said the name of it,
it may be Pueblo West organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, but it was not the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the spot that I would represent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the good weed is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our local news.
[SPEAKER_01]: In bigger news, Colorado is being sued by,
I'm looking for the article on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is being sued by the states of
Nebraska and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about this yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's lighting a joint over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like he's ready for this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, the states of Nebraska and Oklahoma
announced that they have filed lawsuits
[SPEAKER_01]: against Colorado alleging that Colorado's
amendment 64 is unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers,
issued the following statement in
[SPEAKER_01]: response, because neighboring states have
expressed concern about Colorado grown
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana coming into their states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not entirely surprised by this
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it appears the plaintiff's
primary grievance stems from a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-enforcement of federal laws regarding
marijuana, as opposed to choices made by
[SPEAKER_01]: the others of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe this suit is without merit and
we will vigorously defend it against it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nebraska and Oklahoma are trying to sue
Colorado because we are not following
[SPEAKER_01]: federal rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to try to force the feds to
come in here and clean up the weed scene
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gelling all that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think they're gelling?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think that, but those aren't
states that- They're not very popular in
[SPEAKER_04]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're really worried about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are places that pretty much lock you
up forever for having herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like it at all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's happening because I know
people, we read about them getting busted
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are definitely driving pounds,
pounds and pounds out of this state
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're able to produce it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you really think it was any more
than before?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: More personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you here for the wild, wild west
revolution that I talk about when
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody got a red card and there was
nobody to care to regulate it and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody just grew?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first got here, or at least when I
first got here, there wasn't the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: badge system or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could walk into your shop with a
backpack full of quarter pounds and sell
[SPEAKER_01]: them to you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you were getting, here it was
seven to eight, maybe nine, if you could
[SPEAKER_01]: really hustle the shop for a quarter
pound, but I know friends that will maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: send shit to the East coast and they can
get 15 for that same quarter pound to
[SPEAKER_01]: their cousin or their brother that lives
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just send it or drive it out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a 20 something year old kid with
no kids, what's to stop you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my point of view is just the
weeds, it's either going to come from
[SPEAKER_04]: California or it's going to come from
Washington or it's going to come from
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like the weeds just going to be
moving across those states anyways,
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless of whether they sue us,
it'll just go right back to wherever they
[SPEAKER_04]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the solution would just be
nationwide legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine without borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just started a new program,
medicine without borders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make it known and we'll just drive
around your fucking state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about giving it to
convicts and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spin your mic a little towards your face,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about giving it to
convicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you sound like you're up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, they're talking about giving
it to convicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might've taken a lot of dabs before
this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, convicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in jail, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what you saw was on the onion
and I don't think that that was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christy pointed it out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider you're a source, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't read a source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found the fucking internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he could be right, but I'm pretty
sure- Well, all I know is that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a little bit of time and weed makes
it not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it not so annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The loudness and the- Well, that's why
weed cures depression, helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes things that suck not as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people that have to work at
Taco Bell all day get fucking blazed right
[SPEAKER_01]: before they go to Taco Bell all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you try to order your food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to go off on another
rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy at Subway the other day was way
higher than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, and that's saying something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a time and place for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I saved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, it's refreshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might not have internet service on
computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that happens, then we're making a 45
minute video on how bad it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How bad the internet sucks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, because there's not another
internet company, is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get an option in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get one provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little less anxiety for medical
marijuana states on a federal level is the
[SPEAKER_01]: next article here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from The Cannabis, and it's published
December 12th, and it's from Kyle Potter
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, buried deep inside the 1,600
page funding bill, Congress is scrambling
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass to avert a shutdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few lines comforted Minnesota officials
worried about the federal government
[SPEAKER_01]: cracking down on the state's new medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of skim a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, because I want to get to more of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to read this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In its current form, the $1.1 trillion
spending bill includes a section that bans
[SPEAKER_01]: the Department of Justice from using
federal funds to intervene with states
[SPEAKER_01]: with medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can almost stop the whole article right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that says is, I'm going to read it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: In its current form, the $1.1 trillion
spending bill, wrap your head around that
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking number real quick, $1.1 trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it says, bans the Department of
Justice from using federal funds to
[SPEAKER_01]: intervene in states with medical
marijuana, but those measures still
[SPEAKER_01]: conflict with federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And though the Obama administration has
generally been friendlier to marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: than administrations past, Munson Regala
wondered, what if that changes or a new
[SPEAKER_01]: president changes course?
[SPEAKER_01]: The US House narrowly passed the funding
bill with the medical marijuana section
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Senate was expected to take it up
Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he doubts the bill will markedly change
the government's handling of the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most attorneys have indicated they won't
go after medical marijuana businesses as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as they're following state laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is, I think it gives them a
little more comfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't say it gives very much more
comfort, but you never know, he continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is it's still illegal
under federal law, so anything could
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, but they don't have funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: These cops aren't going to go and raid
shit on their own time, are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a cop in California that did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, then you're also, if a cop's
going to go off and do that on his own
[SPEAKER_01]: time without support, he may be looking
for that lucrative income.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to fly in Colorado
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like to me, it's going to lead
to bad to cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone like 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some talk about this
organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that I got through all
the important part, paid all the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got notes and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is like almost a real show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 50 is coming up and I'm getting
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting to think about what we can give
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jesse, if you're listening,
dude, remember you guys kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteered to give some shit away on
number 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to say something,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been kind of like trying to figure
out what to give away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been bouncing things off me and
I've been bouncing things off him and he's
[SPEAKER_06]: like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet us, let us know what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are listening, tweet me at
iGrowCulture or email me iGrowCulture at
[SPEAKER_01]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know what you want for giveaway
prizes and we'll see if we can accommodate
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sean's here, the guy that talked a
whole bunch about cool organic shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys loved that show, drying and
curing and that organic shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: People asked a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't shout out everybody that emailed
me, texted me, tweeted me because I would
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a whole show doing it, but we got a
lot of response on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk more about worm castings
mostly because that's kind of what seemed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the base of a lot of your stuff and
a lot of what got the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our basic tea, you said worm castings
and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned multiplying the protozoa
is something that you really stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I guess my main question
I should ask is what are protozoa?
[SPEAKER_04]: Protozoa are just other microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just the protozoa, it's
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all of the microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bacillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got fungi and bacteria and all
of these beneficial things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just going to give them a food
source and really give them a chance to
[SPEAKER_04]: thrive and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those things actually fall under
the category of protozoa?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the protozoa are a specific,
I don't know what, I can't think the term
[SPEAKER_04]: right off of my head, but yeah,
it's just a certain microbe that lives in
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that I'd never really,
I had seen the word, but I never paid
[SPEAKER_01]: attention until you opened my mind to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I had a weren't so, since we're
on the subject, we have been feeding our
[SPEAKER_04]: worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been substituting alfalfa with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were donated a little over 3000 pounds
of what we call cannabino, which is finely
[SPEAKER_04]: ground material from a local, or actually
I can open vape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you familiar with the company?
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell vapor pens and organa labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They donated the material by law,
by state law, all dispensaries have to
[SPEAKER_04]: dispose of their waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, a lot of people are
just mixing it with old dirt and throwing
[SPEAKER_04]: it in a dumpster and then it's going to a
landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been feeding it to our worms kind
of as a test trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worms loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got our test results back today,
actually, and it was off the chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it really was, let's see what we
had on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give him a second, bear with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's digging through the iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
has definitely been the conversation at
[SPEAKER_01]: work for most of the week anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really takes pride in what he does and
he feeds his worms the highest quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that seems to be the important part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes them produce what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's so focused on cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody wants the cheapest casting out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't really understand that
you're only hurting yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want- Well, I keep saying,
if you're going to cut costs on the grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: then cut the cost on the sale too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to cut cost in one end and it's
not fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with these castings, you can take a
compost and cut 10 to 15% of the compost
[SPEAKER_04]: and then make your own vermicompost and
then cut that in one part peat moss,
[SPEAKER_04]: one part aeration, one part vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your base soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add in your amendment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like your crab meal and your azomite and
kelp and alfalfa, whatever you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: add.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your mixed soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jay's been feeding his worms cannabis
plant matter and they have been freaking
[SPEAKER_04]: loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Test results were astronomical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comparably to running the alfalfa,
the biological life was off the charts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we gained hundreds of...
[SPEAKER_04]: protozoa, fungi, bacteria, the active
fungi, which means basically the things
[SPEAKER_04]: that are working in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we had a higher fungal content,
but that doesn't really mean much if
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not active.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lower fungal content,
but more activity, if that makes more
[SPEAKER_04]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you want more bio life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff is so freaking biodiverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feeding it cannabis made it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to feed that to
your cannabis and then feed those leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: back to those worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A closed loop, self-sustainable system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all got to get away from the
bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reading more about it since Sean
kind of talked about it and we're paying
[SPEAKER_01]: for shipping and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're paying a lot of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at the general organics
label today, just kind of going over what
[SPEAKER_04]: was in it and it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's just so much stuff in the
label and there's really not that much in
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to preserve it and they got to
make it stable and it's got to be chelated
[SPEAKER_01]: or buffered or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's got to be shipped and it's got
to be able to stay in different
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures and it's got to have a shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just make it yourself 24 hours
before you use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell it and it's so much richer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're not throwing away plastic
for all the neighbors to see your freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: botanic air bottles in the trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you talked about multiplying the
protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best way to go about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically you just need to give them a
food source.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you mix your tea up, so basically
what you're going to do is you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: add in your worm castings and then you're
going to put in your food source and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be- I'm going to back up
just for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a nylon or something to keep all the
stuff in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I preach free suspension teas,
especially on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're not doing anything over
15 or 20 gallons, anything- Just throw all
[SPEAKER_04]: the shit right in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just throw it right in there and then
stir it up and it's like top dressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes on kind of like- You need to
bubble it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a bubble?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're going to want to bubble it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get your hopefully reverse osmosis
water or at least let it bubble for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days, get the air out and then
put all your worm castings, your molasses
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatever else you decide to put in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can expand on it as you please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about a lot of cool shit to
put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get your bucket, you get your air
stones, castings and molasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to throw that in there and
you're going to just want to brew it from
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wouldn't recommend taking
anything over that if you're not familiar
[SPEAKER_04]: with brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it on something, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to bubble up and hopefully it's
going to bubble up huge and make a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbling mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do have a big problem with the
foam, it's as simple as dropping a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of like coconut oil in there and then
it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've made plenty of mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to grow in like carpet and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some of your pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just want to feed them and put them
in a bucket and give them some oxygen and
[SPEAKER_01]: they will multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the ratio they multiply?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to give them like 10,000
times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a thousand times more?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get thousands and
thousands of times more.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out anybody who's listening that's
interested in this, like Google microbe
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got amazing articles about brew
times and how you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: take them longer for more fungal dominant
teas, shorter times for more bacterial
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant teas, how you can actually kind
of cook your, or inoculate your
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients for your compost tea to make
it more fungal dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can take your earthworm castings
and sprinkle in a little bit of oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so let's say that you're going to
use three cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made, for example, I mixed a 15
gallon tier there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use three and three quarters cups of
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew I was going to use that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did is I took that three and
three quarters cup of worm castings and
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in a mason jar, uh, added some oat
bran, sprayed with a water bottle and
[SPEAKER_04]: sealed it up about two days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then today I went down into my
basement and cracked it open and it
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was covered in white bacino bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use that for my tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a way to fungal charge the shit
out of your tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis plants love fungal dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to make, instead of
those little scraggly shitty roots you
[SPEAKER_01]: see, it's going to make big, thick white
spaghetti for roots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to, you know, with the,
when you do the free suspension teas and
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of get messy, your drip trays
will fill up with dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how it gets at the end of the
grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen my roots will grow right
into that dirt in the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they just can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm definitely, I need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stores in Colorado Springs,
I live about 45 minutes away from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to plan a trip up there quite
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, here within the next week,
I've got some freshly transplanted stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I want to feed some Rocky Mountain
worm tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you keep talking about azomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want, I've always thought of azomite
as something I wanted to add during
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want that in my veg phase as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, really it's just more for
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to mix it in with your
soil, um, which most people will do,
[SPEAKER_04]: or they'll have some sort of amendment
similar, uh, in their soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really wouldn't recommend it until
you're flowering, especially if you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, not transplanting really.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, these plants I'm doing now are
going to finish in their little pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the azomite, I know a lot of people
who will do, uh, worm castings,
[SPEAKER_04]: grow kashi and azomite every two weeks as
a top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to learn more about the kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's all grow kashi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think, I don't know, the grow
kashi is really cool, but I feel like a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people are using it just to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they really understand
what they're using it for.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is that, uh, it's lactic acid
bacteria, it's photosynthetic bacteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of other things going on in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to introduce that into
your root zone, into your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the grow kashi will actually help
digest old root parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, and things that are sitting in
your soil kind of stagnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of like enzymes would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like enzymes would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can show you how to kick that
bottle off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as simple as sprouting some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there's something else I'm going to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take me a little bit of
time, but eventually I'm going to get away
[SPEAKER_01]: from all the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I taught Adam how to grow mostly
with full bottled stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's over there shaking his head like,
I have to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the seed process the other day and
I, it just clicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I compare it to like cooking, you know,
like when you, when you first start
[SPEAKER_04]: cooking and you look at recipes online and
stuff, they're freaking overwhelming
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's so many things that go
into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you acquire, once you're,
you know, your cabinet's filled with all
[SPEAKER_04]: those spices, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes five minutes to, you know,
whip up a meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same thing with the tea is
it's overwhelming at first, but once you
[SPEAKER_04]: have castings and molasses and kelp and
hydrosalate and everything that you use,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're buying all those things in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're getting them at a fraction of
the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without water weight for shipping too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can buy everything locally between
Jesse at Hydro and then Jay up at Rocky
[SPEAKER_04]: Mount Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's yeah, there's absolutely no reason
to buy anything online.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's a good time for me to drop in man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always up there.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday through Friday, midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do things too damn early.
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lunchtime is when I do business.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to stop up there and check out
these Cana castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty freaking sweet,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'll be up there really
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go get some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sparked so many questions,
so many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure which one to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I'll choose one from a listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to grab my phone again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm the wrong person in this
damn chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if Jesse was here right now,
he would have been all in this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just sitting over here like with
my mouth open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing about this because I see it
around in all the growing footage and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of my show is to bring the growers on
your level and the growers on his level
[SPEAKER_01]: together, because we're not different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were playing guitar or being a
skateboarder or you probably play Xbox way
[SPEAKER_01]: better than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might MMA fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing weed while you were doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll help you grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully when I want to learn how to MMA
fight or some shit, you're down to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live back East.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nobody that was willing to teach
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's, I watched all the
YouTube videos for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now being able to see it firsthand and
being able to have different styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I let you trim the first time,
I thought you had a boner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did until the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like, it got really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I gave him that grateful dog,
he went nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that doesn't really affect the
podcast here because I'm getting a phone
[SPEAKER_01]: call and it's popping up on my computer
because the new iOS, no, it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new iOS 8 likes to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No dude, I like having you on because you
don't have to be a pro to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you might ask the one question that
the listeners are wondering because we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean and I kind of know what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just, we get, I've been told that
we're snobs and we just talk right over
[SPEAKER_01]: some points because we expect everyone to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wears off really well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, it's, it's just, I go home and
she'll have like, Oh, this, so and so gave
[SPEAKER_01]: us some bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I don't, I don't want that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you've seen some things,
we've kind of opened Adam's eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Adam first moved here, he would have
smoked anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have smoked anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that guy that cleans out your
ashtray and smokes the stuff out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally be Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got an on email though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this is a Facebook comment from
our good buddy, Fred, Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fred likes to comment and I appreciate it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one says, ha ha, shout out Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, episode 44 was rocking, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught that tease about the next episode
and MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nothing about it except Cushman
yammering on about it being bad on a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple other podcasts, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it in my can of A and B cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is bad, what synthetic newt line
should I, should I slash we be looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, keep the shows coming and stay
frosty bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I want to say,
dude, thanks for freaking sending us
[SPEAKER_01]: messages, uh, participating and thank and
thanking us for what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, did you catch that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something went digital on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's back though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a question for Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about MAP and DAP.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So MAP and DAP is, uh, let's see if I can
say this right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mono ammonium phosphate and dio
potassium phosphate or something similar
[SPEAKER_04]: to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but basically they're, uh,
they're chemicals that are used in
[SPEAKER_04]: basically every single hydro product or
synthetic nutrient product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they're synthetic salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the big problem with them,
uh, in my opinion is they don't flush out
[SPEAKER_04]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, you know, I don't think that you
can get them out, uh, heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that are stored in the
tricone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you kind of get them in there,
there's no way to get them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're blasting, you're blasting
those heavy metals into your mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a, you know, I kind of
mentioned azomite a couple of times and
[SPEAKER_04]: azomite is one of the things that's filled
with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really want to be, you know,
you don't want to use too much of that
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, uh, glacial rock dust filled with
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just, uh, or, uh, synthetics,
you know, that are filled with these
[SPEAKER_04]: things, but mono MAP and DAP are probably
the worst of all, uh, just in the simple
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that they're the most common and it's
easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something easy to look out for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not telling you to like run away
from the MAP and DAP, but it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're somebody who's interested in a
cleaner product, something that's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more organic, uh, you know,
you need to become familiar with the terms
[SPEAKER_04]: that you need to look out for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are some of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're looking for a nice
organic product, look for something with
[SPEAKER_04]: like a soybean meal or kelp or alfalfa or
brew or yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Synthetics offers stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Synthetics is a killer line.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biobiz is especially if he's running Kana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're running Kana,
then you know, Biobiz is an organic
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very similar style of growing,
uh, really high quality stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, or grown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if everybody probably follows
that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He straight crushes it all Biobiz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know if he really talks about
what he uses, but a lot of us don't talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about it on the, on the Instagram feeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call him out because he's got
amazing shit and he's using organics and
[SPEAKER_04]: he deserves to be called out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use organics and get in good progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's deserve to be noted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the Biobiz is a really good one
to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, general organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, that's another one to
use.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good, but you know,
to each his own.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's what's the big one on the market
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mother of all blooms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what Moab is, is just map.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the ingredients,
it's like 99.9% map.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to sit here and tell you
that it's like going to kill you or it's
[SPEAKER_04]: bad for you, but it's one of the things
you want to look out for if you're an
[SPEAKER_04]: organic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just printed on the bottle as mono
ammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking for it, that's map
and DAP is the DIO.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to avoid that,
that those are the two to stray from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I know I'm just parroting what
Cushman says, but Cushman says that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: often what gives you, when you smoke good
weed and for some reason you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: headache and you're like, but that was
good herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did he give me a headache?
[SPEAKER_01]: It had map and DAP residuals in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't prove that, but that's what
Cushman has led me to believe from
[SPEAKER_01]: everything he has said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mostly trust Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason not to trust Cushman in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: He smokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's, he's the, he's kicking ass and
taking names with his veganics right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's won a couple of cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really knows what the plant wants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take his word for it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recycle your soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I ask you that in the last episode?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't like to recycle my soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it because it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't, if I recycle my soil,
I like to use it as a, in my veggie
[SPEAKER_04]: garden, but I just, I haven't mastered
that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see a loss in yield, no matter
what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've blamed it on other things and haven't
attributed it to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking that these worm castings are
going to help me out, fix that problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm having better luck starting with
sterile medias.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I used to run like happy frog
and roots and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I switched it up to more of like a pro mix
base.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a lot better results out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm running my own like vermicompost,
peat moss and buckwheat hole with
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the pro mix and stuff, I'm getting
better results with reusing the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot easier to amend it at the
beginning of being a sterile media.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can write down how much of what I put
into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically if my plant doesn't show a
deficiency throughout that cycle,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remend everything like I would,
you know, a brand new soil mix and grow
[SPEAKER_04]: right back into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, you know, running the Fox farm
and the roots organic, I feel like with
[SPEAKER_04]: the guanos and the blood meals and
everything that's already in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: plus me amending it by the end of the
cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, the mine had to have been of any
deficiencies, but I really don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: where that soil is at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of where I'm at with
reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of what I found to do
with, I've been doing with my soil lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take it and mix it with the stuff out
of my Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all of the slimy leftover pickled
trash that ends up in your Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just mix it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you're making him hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do that shit, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just dump it out into your,
you know, into like a Rubbermaid container
[SPEAKER_04]: and fill it up with dirt and then just let
it sit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then basically, you know, in a couple
of weeks or a month or two, whenever I get
[SPEAKER_04]: around to going back to those buckets,
it'll be compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll mix that with worm castings
and use that as a vermicompost for my
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use it up a lot of space, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just picture a lot of space when I'm
thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a garage and I don't park my car in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I'm storing everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do crazy shit so other people don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any like weird experiments you
want to try and you don't have the space,
[SPEAKER_04]: just email Jeff and he'll let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have a friend in California who
wants your bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant with bugs,
he wants you to clip off a leaf of that or
[SPEAKER_01]: a branch of that plant and send it to him
so that he can play with the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his specialty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treetown.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treetown Farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met a guy at the cup who does something
similar with a microscopes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been through a couple of Elaine
Ingram courses and he's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: send me your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me your tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get them looked at.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to find your niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam's a good little a transplant or a
grunt worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does some shit in the gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just worked to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in the room and him and this
other dude had dirt flying three feet in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air and all of it was landing into
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Mike knew what to think
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you definitely work at a different
pace than what Mike's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I not use in my organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be my last question for
the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on your level of like,
you know, your dedication to organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first thing that I would kick out
would be blood meal and bone meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really care about organics,
chances are you don't eat GMOs and you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't eat, I'm not going to say you're a
vegetarian if you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're into organics and stuff,
but those things are byproducts of like
[SPEAKER_04]: the slaughterhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feather meal is a byproduct of the poultry
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have their place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, because I'd rather
than be recycled into agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: byproducts for farm and other agricultural
uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it comes to growing medicine for
people, I don't believe that feather meal
[SPEAKER_04]: made from chickens that were fed,
you know, antibiotics and hormones should
[SPEAKER_04]: be used to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with the blood that's scraped
off the slaughterhouse floor to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: blood meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just this gelatinous goo filled with
everything that was in that cow bone meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to use things like
that, I would just recommend there's other
[SPEAKER_04]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use things like fish, blood meal,
alfalfa, kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of plant baits.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to get into it,
comfrey and burdock root and nettle and
[SPEAKER_04]: dandelions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, go out in the woods and
pick a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to come back from the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company with a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: backseat full of brand new shit and
rethink my whole growing method the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time I go in here?
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cool thing is, is you're going to,
you'll probably see a couple of things
[SPEAKER_04]: that you've seen at Jesse's shop too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you see those, you know,
might click with you like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe I should pick those up next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to, if you're going to be going
up to J's, check out the C Crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little secret product.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I use in my garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gifted by Jay a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're the second one to tell me
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our buddy Spence had some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might've picked it or Jay might've
given him some of it or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I use it to basically replace my full
power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're, if anybody out there is
familiar with full power or fulvic acid or
[SPEAKER_04]: humic acid, I use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And replace it in place of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you'll be there when I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fungal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me a call.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure when I'm going yet,
but you know, I'm always looking for an
[SPEAKER_04]: excuse to get up to the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go find one more gift for the
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to sneak away while she's at work
and sneak up there and get some worm
[SPEAKER_01]: casting worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more gift for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of gifts, if you guys want to get
a cool gift for somebody, come and get
[SPEAKER_04]: that like a bukkashi bucket, a worm,
you know, home worm farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I need one of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ship it to Australia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Help your grower be more self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come by Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They listened to the podcast because they
said they liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, I'm going to come get some worm
castings and we should talk about some
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsorship sort of stuff because people
seem to be responding to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to support semi-local shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not Pueblo, but I still love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll brag about worm castings and you
supply me with worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they might be more than happy to
work with you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're big fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love it.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're doing a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to get in there and learn
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, we've got 53 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start closing up the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have you back on more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what you, we get sidetracked
because we're potheads, but I like having
[SPEAKER_01]: you on and you have a lot of useful shit
to share with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then send anybody who has any
questions, send them to Jeff and get them
[SPEAKER_04]: to send them to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have them ready next time and we'll
just slam through them, but I'm fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took solventless dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took live resin dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took shattered dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam looks dabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just tired as fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This delicious yerba mate is keeping me
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the mate factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a big shout out to Sweet Angela for
getting me addicted to the yerba mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, babe, but jeez, this mate,
I don't know what you've done to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've created a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mate is so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best idea we had though was buying
bags to bring it home and make it so now
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have to drive to our favorite
mate spot in Colorado Springs or in
[SPEAKER_01]: Manitou Springs every time we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mate because we would do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's a great excuse to get up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The place is freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more comfortable in Manitou Springs
than I am here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get bad here, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of, yeah, it's a little
gangster here, but I feel like I have more
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that are more open to go do shit
in Manitou.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to go out of their house here
because it's weird here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to really go have fun at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go walk in Manitou.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go walk and enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody got any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody you want to say you love to?
[SPEAKER_01]: You love anybody, anything like that,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a boy's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a boy's birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, little miniature Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen pictures of him on Facebook
riding a skateboard and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be just like you when he
grows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got him a Genesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a shout out to my girl
Kelly for holding it down while I was in
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: She took care of the grow and kept the
plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know she was pissed that I left,
so I love you, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm constantly trying to talk my wife into
just learning that, the ability to take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk in there and go, why is
everything all droopy?
[SPEAKER_04]: They take in a lot more than they let on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought that my girl could do it,
but given the chance, she could probably
[SPEAKER_04]: make a tea better than most.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Queen Cola?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time since I've seen you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to take dabs together over at
Maddie's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're smiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job on holding down the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to give a shout out to my chick if
we're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My chick knows her way around the garden,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need anything done, she can
definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here goes my phone again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I just mentioned her and she started
calling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take Rumpelstilts again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam, you shouted out the boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Bender, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running the servers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, running the servers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You paid my bills, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for real.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm there busting my butt,
but it's just... Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phone ringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got off work early.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for another episode of the iGrow
Culture Podcast, your source for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: news, education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode number 46.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and I'm coming
to you this week with a solo episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the day after Christmas and all my
friends are hanging out with their
[SPEAKER_01]: families, so I put together a quick show
this week and I'll probably do a short
[SPEAKER_01]: episode next week also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody had a wonderful holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whichever holiday you choose, to
celebrate, I hope it was wonderful for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe a huge thank you to my mom for an
amazing Christmas gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot believe what my mom put together
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, big thanks to my queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, Angela.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made Christmas awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you spent that with my family and
I, your family now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I owe a big Christmas shout out to
the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting me be a part of your
Secret Santa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt blessed to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm still dabbed out from the dab
gauntlet we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wearing the socks that I scored at
the Secret Santa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exchange right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my Huff socks on and my feet are
nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a cold ass night here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit, it's snowing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's windy as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these socks came in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado, I hope you're warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week is a, it's New Year's Eve,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will be at the String Cheese Incident
Concerts in Broomfield, Colorado with my
[SPEAKER_01]: lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking a little mini vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next week and this week will be kind of
easy shows without a ton of info.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do promise you guys that I'll get
back to the original format with tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: info and great guests at the start of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The holidays got everybody in chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is, we're all growers and we all
have jobs and families.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the guys just decided to hang
out and not do a show with me this week,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody who has been on
the show, who's taken some time out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their life to come put in an hour,
an hour and a half with the I Grow Culture
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The listeners love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a few people to thank and a few
things to remind you guys of.

nutrients and they'll give you a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this podcast is also brought to you by
our good friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live music, lifestyle, magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews, www.treethugger
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect to all the sponsors for
making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: That song that just played was from the
Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me play all of their music on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every episode I try to give them a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're SoCal reggae, kind of funk reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a lot of cool stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably going to play in your
neighborhood sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those kids travel around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they are in Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last pictures I saw, they were in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it's good to see the Mystic Roots
Band in Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're just out having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're playing,
but all the pictures I've seen is just
[SPEAKER_01]: them on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is well-deserved, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are having a great
vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Kat and Coot in the Mystic
Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a bunch of comments and stuff to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I want to do first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just smacked the microphone with the
papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have taken a bunch of dads
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to remind you guys that we're
going to change the name of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is not going to be the
iGrowCulture podcast for much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be called the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've said before, there's an
agricultural educational entity that has
[SPEAKER_01]: the moniker iGrow taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I was told that iTunes doesn't
appreciate people ripping off the I.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to change it to Grow From Your
Heart because that's what this is all
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always said grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow your herb, your cannabis,
your medicine from your heart,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will produce better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't grow your cannabis from your
wallet or your ego or your camera,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I take a lot of pictures,
but I grow dank herb because I grow from
[SPEAKER_01]: my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm able to take the dank
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not thinking about my wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not thinking about the harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay attention to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm in the grow room,
I'm thinking about what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: after I grow this herb properly,
after I flush it, after I chop it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: after I trim it, after I cure it,
after I give it to my patients that smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an older friend, his initials are
DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to call him out on the
show, but he's who I think of when I think
[SPEAKER_01]: of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good friend of mine and I'm his
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see him consume the herb that I put
my love into, I can see him get something
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of him feels better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just a physical thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just him getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an emotional thing that happens to
that guy when my medicine makes him feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that emotional thing happens back to
me and it fulfills my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grow from my heart and you should
grow from your heart as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it'll improve your outlook on
your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll improve your cannabis overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll improve your relationship with your
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just make things a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit growing from your wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit growing from the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit growing from your camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit growing from your ego and grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grow from your heart podcast,
that's our new motto, grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming with a new name requires a new
logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't change the name until I have a
sweet ass new logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of you artists out there would
like to throw me down a grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart podcast hosted by Rasta Jeff logo,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of money to tell you
the truth, but I would compensate you in
[SPEAKER_01]: some way that made you happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take multiple gifts over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will work something out because I like
to pay back my community that helps me out
[SPEAKER_01]: and you like to help your community out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do me a favor, make me a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse said it actually, it's a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you've ever grown pot when you
germinate seeds, they crack open and the
[SPEAKER_01]: taproot comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that cracks open, it kind of makes
the shape of a heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can kind of make that into a
heart with the little thing coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but then make that taproot actually
turning into maybe, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get creative, but I want to see
that heart coming out or just whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: with a heart in it or grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I like red, yellow and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Rasta farian.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, I've never said this on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to make a Rasta farian
themed logo, the red goes on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's red, gold and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, red, yellow, green, but the red is on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually green, yellow,
red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do that properly if you're going to
make me a logo because I'm a Rasta and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want it right, because it's almost
disrespectful to put your logo with the
[SPEAKER_01]: colors upside down if you're bringing it
in a Rasta way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a real Rasta, you'll understand
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if I put the American flag
upside down, it would piss a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just imagine you people getting the
Rasta flag backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of frustrates some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give too much of a shit about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just letting you know that you're
doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we need a new theme song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds awesome, but wouldn't it be a
lot cooler if I had a customized theme
[SPEAKER_01]: song that was like something about grow
from your heart?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how it would go,
but maybe some dance hall reggae or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your job, not mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's got a song for me,
I got the same deal for you as I do the
[SPEAKER_01]: logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kind of kick down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado, I'll hand you packs
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get iri genetic seeds, feminized or
regular or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get more hoodies made.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of the iri genetics hoodies are being
planned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're negotiating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to kind of hesitate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it at the start of the
year just for tax purposes, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get some more hoodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you'll get a hoodie out of the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm begging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just asking for a new logo and a new
theme song for the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast because I'm too busy putting
together shows and growing gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching people how to grow herb to
actually be able to make a new logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really have good art skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do that, I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next part?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been getting a ton of emails,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been getting so many emails,
tweets and Facebook messages about the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overwhelming in such a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for messaging
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The huge response I've gotten the last few
episodes has really inspired me to push
[SPEAKER_01]: the show to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been putting more time into the shows
and doing more research because I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep bringing the best show that I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you guys message me,
that makes me want to try a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just want to step it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of tweets that I saved
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got them in my phone, so I've got to
search through the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just said, I want to bring you
guys better shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring you a half-ass New Year's Eve
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any guests or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd have people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a lot planned,
but I'm going to make it dope for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Party McFly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Rasta Jeff, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you can tweet me at the
iGrowCulture or it's at iGrowCulture or
[SPEAKER_01]: you can also tweet me it's at Rasta Jeff
420 if you just want to hit me directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check them both quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite frequently, like once a day
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude says, bro, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first podcast I've been into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to start from the
beginning and catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm embarrassed that you're going to do
that because honestly, well, let me not
[SPEAKER_01]: say I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm proud now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 25 episodes or so, I didn't know
what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned on the microphone and just
blurted out a bunch of shit and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of my face is how the show went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started making too many notes
and it got a little weird, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of comfortable with the
microphone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just turn it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make a few bullet points and start going
and it all comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so hyper critical of it now,
but dude, Party McFly and the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote your Twitter handle is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even, I don't know how you did
that, but it's at frivolous,
[SPEAKER_01]: F-R-I-V-O-L-A-S if you want to follow
Party McFly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for the tweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you listen to every single episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to listen to them all,
they're on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last 10 are on Stitcher,
but every single episode all the way from
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning, all the way up to whatever
episode you're on will always be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: iregeneticscolorado.com website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to change the tab on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a lot of changing you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to be in the same feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're listening on iTunes or
Stitcher or whatever, the feed will still
[SPEAKER_01]: be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming to the website,
it'll still be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't lose me when I change my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be super easy, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Party Mc, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a bunch of dabs, a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made these dabs even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Party McFly, thanks for messaging me on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next tweet came from Roadrunner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at road underscore runner 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, listening from the UK,
still underground here, but great to see
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys leading the way for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those words of encouragement mean a lot to
me, like I was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to hear that they're doing
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just put in a bunch of work
and nobody says anything and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, but you guys have been making me feel
like I'm killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten 6,500 listens on some
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The episode with King Kola is probably
going to hit 10,000 episodes eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be the first one to do it,
which is remarkable because it's a newer
[SPEAKER_01]: episode and there's been a lot of time on
other shows and they haven't been listened
[SPEAKER_01]: to nearly as much as the episodes with
King Kola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to King Kola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And episode 35 with drying and curing also
has been a huge success.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys haven't listened to that one,
it's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back and listen to number 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a recommendation for you,
35 and then the ones with King Kola,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pause and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back and checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think that from 35 on is where
if 35 through 45 are some of our best
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 44 is random chatter because we got chatty
and then 41 is chatty stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, the 35 through 45
are some of my favorite, most proud
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 more about Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: 43 intro to organics with King Kola.
[SPEAKER_01]: 43 intro to organics with King Kola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some great episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 42, intro to NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got a lot of response.
[SPEAKER_01]: The episodes about building your grow,
39 and 40, those really crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 37 was planning your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 35, drying and curing definitely has
been listened to a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot, guys, for listening to
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that you're paying
attention and liking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so rambling today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I turned on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab right quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some dabs sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a mix of stuff that I recently
grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: My homie, Spence, taught me how to make
this hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually wasn't making it, just letting
other people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why not be self-sufficient,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is White Widow, Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's no cookies in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's White Widow, Golden Goat,
Flow, Ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Gorilla Glue number four in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Lemon Jeffrey in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is quite a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take a dab with me, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big shout out to Giddy up
in Emotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hitting this G-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it turned on for about a month
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't turned it off, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was a big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this G-Nail has not given me any
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a USB port on the front that'll
charge up your phone so you can plug in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've only got a limited spot of
plugs, you can plug in your E-Nail or the
[SPEAKER_01]: G-Nail, and then you can plug in your
iPhone into that and charge your phone
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're taking hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Giddy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came right before Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the tweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Jake and Emily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, I just yelled into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the software fixes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Jake and Emily for the
emails they sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be in touch very soon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't responded to a bunch of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been the holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a little overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get back to you, I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys said some things, and I'm
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to give a big thanks to G35.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even ask, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can be G35 if he wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brent M.
[SPEAKER_01]: and also Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for all your
interaction messages, tweets, emails,
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebooks, all of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the emails, guys,
so keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them to igroculture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I'm going to have to change that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make another email address
since we're changing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just keep that and I'll forward it,
but we'll make up another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 50 is coming up, you guys,
and I'm planning a small celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get as many
microphones as I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get that many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: My software or my setup here, I could
probably put in 20 microphones with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the inputs and other inlines I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get Adam and Jesse and maybe Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Matty, you're invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have Matty on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great to have the first chick on
the show be you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, the first woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sexist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have the first woman on the show be
Matty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to correct myself there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like your guys' input about episode
number 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to email me or tweet me,
now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know, what were some of your
favorite moments on the podcast so far?
[SPEAKER_01]: What stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's an episode or a moment that
stood out, tweet me and tell me what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to celebrate that on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you guys learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something that you learned that
really stood out, that really ... Have you
[SPEAKER_01]: ever heard somebody say one thing and
you're like, oh my God, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to this guy ramble for a whole
hour, and that's the one thing that made
[SPEAKER_01]: it worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got one thing that you learned or
something that really stood out,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you guys learned from
me or us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, who's your favorite guest on my
podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of people on, Spence,
Jesse, Mike, Adam, Kingkola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Addison Demora was on the show via
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of my most proud because that
was my second episode and I called up
[SPEAKER_01]: Addison like I had a podcast going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of funny of me to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should try that again and see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to know, what would you guys
like to hear next?
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk a lot and why not make it be about
something that you guys actually want to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I'm just going to talk,
you can tell me what you want me to say
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of me just rambling and rambling
and rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me some info, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's igroculture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tweet me at igroculture or you can
find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a message there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just search for igroculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a personal Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys find that, I don't accept
every friend request right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of I'll troll you a little bit and
see who you are before I approve your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because if Facebook's getting weird,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be that open anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see, I'm completely open
with the iReGenetics stuff and the
[SPEAKER_01]: iGroculture stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that is fair game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tweet, I Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, my iReGenetics Instagram blows up
and I'm going to brag a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom spoiled the shit out of me for
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows that I've been looking at this
Nikon camera and so on Christmas,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gifts were all done and then she slid
this other box toward me and just smiled
[SPEAKER_01]: and had a tear in her eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I opened it, I kind of got a tear in
my eye also because she hooked me up with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Nikon D32, the D3200, the package with
the extra lens and the bag and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been eyeballing that thing for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's why I shouted her out at the
start of the show, but holy shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, that's one of the best gifts I've
ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to discredit any other gifts,
but I mean, holy crap, that's the camera
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been eyeballing for months and moms
bought it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that my Instagram is going to
improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see better pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see more angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see more zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see better, better,
better, just because I've got better gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been shooting those Instagram shots
you see if you follow me on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those shots come from a Panasonic Lumix
point and shoot camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was $199 at Best Buy and that's what
I'm pulling off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that I've upgraded to this freaking
badass camera, I think you'll see some
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've been rambling about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But follow me on Instagram if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's iGrowCulture or iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post a lot of stuff on iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post about every three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try just to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap, guys, I'm dabbed out and I feel
like I'm talking really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a big yoga breath together and
slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the sound of me calming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that shit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to calm down for this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend whose name is Deacon
Gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deacon Gray is a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Oklahoma, but he currently
resides in the great city of Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've gone to a show at ComedyWorks,
there's a good chance you've seen Deacon
[SPEAKER_01]: Gray as an opening act.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little white-haired dude that tells
weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about being from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hilarious in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deacon Gray has made me laugh my ass off
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go to this website that I've
got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to search through it real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm stumbling because I was trying
to be somber about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to back up one tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help Deacon Gray grab cancer by the
throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deacon was living his life and slinging
his jokes and doing his duties as a new
[SPEAKER_01]: talent coordinator at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was hunky-dory, except that his
friends say hunky-dory when he noticed he
[SPEAKER_01]: had a lump on his neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better have that looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he had it looked at, and they wanted
to look at it a little closer,
[SPEAKER_01]: like take a tonsil out closer,
which they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news, it's cancer, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news, it's a highly curable kind
of cancer, the same kind the Nuggets
[SPEAKER_01]: coach, George Carl, beat recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: His prognosis is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: His spirits are good, but he's got several
weeks of chemotherapy and radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says click more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read all this to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm headed for is Deacon Gray has
made me laugh my ass off several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's funny as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tells weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: His delivery is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in return for making me laugh,
I want to shout out his website so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can raise this guy a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got throat cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get him through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can't smoke cannabis right now because
he's got throat cancer, but he can
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely eat edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you live near Deacon Gray and you
see him laying edible on him, a good
[SPEAKER_01]: edible, don't give him some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him a good, clean, quality edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, go to giveforward.com
and search for Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for the... It just wants to
show me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giveforward.com slash fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just go to giveforward.com and search
for Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's D-E-A-C-O-N.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his last name is Gray,
G-R-A-Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can donate as little as $5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody on here donated.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the last donations that I saw was
$1,000, and I thought that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could give somebody $1,000 for
their cancer treatment and help,
[SPEAKER_01]: but man, I will contribute a little bit to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't disclose how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal donation, but I will
donate to this cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm leaving the tab open so that I can do
it right after the show here, but I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it if you guys just went
through a couple bucks toward Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to beg for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude's got throat cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laughter is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to giveforward and help out
Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, I'll read out his website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giveforward.com and just search for
Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really close to his goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to raise $10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's already got $4,120.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's almost 50% of the way through 39
donations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deacon Gray, shout out, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you get to hear this somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope somebody relays this to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made me laugh a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the least I can do for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to go and read a news article
that kind of hit home for me because,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you'll understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see Breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the iGrowCulture podcast,
but I'm also the guy that owns
[SPEAKER_01]: iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse is actually part of the team now.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of his stuff is available through me
yet, but it will be very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jesse is part of the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see his projects coming through,
but you'll understand why this hits home
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article was written by Jason Blevins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from the Denver Post originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was published December 24th at 5.05 PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says,
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Holmes gently lowers the turntable
needle onto the album and traffic's
[SPEAKER_01]: medicated goo begins to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Winwood's wistful tenor sweeps
through the centennial seeds laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: My own homegrown recipe will see it
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone stole from Steve Winwood,
Holmes says, his foot tapping as he
[SPEAKER_01]: injects a syringe of dark syrupy liquid
into his gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one is stealing from Holmes,
a self-taught scientist, engineer,
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer, and cannabis seed geek who next
month will take a rare step to apply for a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent on a laboriously created cannabis
super string.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is awarded, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent on Holmes medical grade auto two
string will be the first to protect a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant and a first step in
establishing plant reader rights for
[SPEAKER_01]: growers who only a few years ago were
considered criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I said the strain is called auto two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spelled O-T-T-O and then the Roman
numeral two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not auto like auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, I'm saying auto and I would
say auto if it were spelled the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are haters of auto flowers,
that's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just auto like the dude from The
Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably got some Canadian influence,
I would assume, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this industry came up in stealth,
born in basements and crawl spaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: Holmes said, but now with companies
forming and making larger investments,
[SPEAKER_01]: the desire to protect intellectual
property is becoming paramount,
[SPEAKER_01]: bleeding edge stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of hits home to me
because I breed seeds and I create strains
[SPEAKER_01]: and I see people, I don't want to say
ripping them off because I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: they thought of it before me, if they just
happened to post it to Instagram after me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but people, we like to borrow names in
this industry for strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we're coming up with something
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to hear a thumping
noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm moving this microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sliding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to tighten this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tighten up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if that sounds like shit from the
recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to censor or edit that out
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making stuff, my strains get stolen
often and I can't complain about it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm actually using other people's
strains to make mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody had to make the seeds for me to
breed with, but just give credit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now people are going to be able to
patent stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm worried about mainly are
people with more money going to punk me
[SPEAKER_01]: and patent my shit and squeeze me right
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to see other people claiming
that they own Capelton?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know the legal parts of this
enough to know, but I do know that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any money compared to a lot of these
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am small time compared to a lot of these
people, compared to Greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to the Cali Connection,
compared to DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am nobody and those guys could squeeze
me out tomorrow if they wanted to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but luckily we're a friendly industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big business doesn't give a shit about
friendly industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll squeeze us all out by doing this
kind of stuff because they've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I fear, but I'm a paranoid
hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on too many fish parking lots to
have a clear head about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just always think the paranoid part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me read more of the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, indeed, gone are the days when
pie-eyed longhairs haphazardly hurled
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen into jungles of pot plants,
hoping to mill two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's such a great cliche in one
fucking sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got pie-eyed longhairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see those guys, pie-eyed
longhairs all, I'm high and I got big
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So haphazardly hurling pollen,
they're just got this male plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just beating it into the room in
the jungles of pot plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no strain selection here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just put a bunch of females in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just talking shit about the sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoping to meld two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's top readers are geneticists,
taking years to weed through carefully
[SPEAKER_01]: engineered generations of cannabis to
elevate the most desired traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's a pretty accurate statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the new super strains are high-end
cannabidiol or CBD, one of several dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid chemical compounds in cannabis
and the plant's major non-psychoactive
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was proud because he said chemical
compound, but then he said ingredient and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that ruined him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so critical of these guys' articles
and I bet I say some really dumb shit on
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast because I'm high, but these
guys have editors and proofreaders and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here spouting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken dabs and drink mate and can't
be held accountable for anything I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD has been credited with relieving some
epileptic seizures, prompting widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: calls for additional research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other more utilitarian super strains are
resistant to mites or the crop killing
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew that plagues grow
operations across Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop killing powdery mildew that plagues
grow operations across Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like we only have that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have powdery mildew all over the
place, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you're singling out
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does happen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm chanting about that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get more into the article here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some super strains are simply super stony
with sky-high levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the
psychoactive compound in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to scroll way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like seven ads here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gas chromatograph is Holm's key in
shaping auto to a high CBD low THC strain
[SPEAKER_01]: he hopes can fuel medical therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 50-year-old gizmo separates molecules
and converts them into an electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: impulse, a green line tracking across
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reveals the THC level in the substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That line will be the baseline for a
measurement of auto to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holm's produces a well-worn label tablet
laden with acronyms and millivolt values
[SPEAKER_01]: from the gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those figures reveal his painstaking
progress toward breeding the THC out and
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBD into his treasured varietal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in many ways the result of a
lifelong career dedicated to breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, cloning, engineering,
and charting the most useful cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Wynwood sings the oft-covered Dear Mr.
Fantasy, Holm shares his plans to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: auto too, which ranks among the most
valuable of his collection of 400
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of cannabis seeds, both
marijuana and hemp, most of which are
[SPEAKER_01]: stored in an additional freezer in his
Lafayette lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the patent, he hopes to be
the first cannabis breeder to secure
[SPEAKER_01]: protection under the Plant Variety
Protection Act, the seminal plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder's rights legislation from 1970.
[SPEAKER_01]: The value of that seed long-term could be
very, very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: An annuity, said Holm's, a father of two
who serves on the state's Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Advisory Committee and is collaborating on
the University of Colorado's
[SPEAKER_01]: groundbreaking Cannabis Genomic Research
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys haven't checked that out,
you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Cannabis Genomic Research
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to it in this article on
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can find this article on the
cannabis, it's the article about pot
[SPEAKER_01]: growers' new quest U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: patent protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This link is in that article.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone who does this wants to produce
something with durability, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: A seed with good utility that produces
well can have longevity for generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read a few strains that I can keep
those seeds around, and that Capelten,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bounty killer, will be good forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get back into the article
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of a random rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Holm's is sort of a modern day
Luther Burberry who you should read about,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pioneering American botanist and
horticulturist who developed more than 800
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and strains of plants in the
late 1800s and early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Luther Burbank, if you want to
Google him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wikipedia, that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burbank faced intellectual property
challenges in his career as he created
[SPEAKER_01]: still herald peaches, plums, daisies,
and the world-dominant Burbank russet
[SPEAKER_01]: potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holm's follows Burbank's lead,
offering a few types of seeds to a single
[SPEAKER_01]: large distributor who can flood the market
in the first year before anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: can take it as their own by cloning a
bunch of them until I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time copycats have cloned Holm's of
strains, he already has made his money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also licenses the use of his heirloom
seeds, but not the extra special seeds he
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't want copied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy could get completely denied
for his attempt at patenting his cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, but if he does, he's going to open
the floodgates for a lot of shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: people will start patenting their own
strains, I bet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means I'm going to have to get on
the game, get lawyered up a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: harder for a lawyer that knows about
patent laws too.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, this game is getting so vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have your hands in everything
now to be able to keep up in this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to move to Colorado and
get in the cannabis industry, I recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: you do like a year of research before you
get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe come here and talk to somebody who's
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can help you out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know a lot about getting into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like into, if you want to
dispensary or something, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to get you into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I want to talk about in this
episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about the new year is
coming up and the new year is always a
[SPEAKER_01]: good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody says they want to do new year's
resolutions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good time to start a new
grow calendar or a schedule to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: make a game plan, clean up your grow room,
get everything started fresh again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then instead of just cutting a bunch
of clones, and having a bunch of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and veg, and having some shit over here
and some more shit over here, think about
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about how many lights you have in
each space.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many flowering lights do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many plants fit under each of those
lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do they take to flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got about 65 days underneath this
light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in about 65 days, you need more
plants to go under there, but you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days to clean that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to sweep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to wipe the walls down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to clean all the dirt out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to repot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get shit back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember that in like nine weeks,
you need more plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to cut clones about three to
four, maybe five weeks before that,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how much space you have,
you got to get your shit ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good time for you guys to
start working on an advanced grow
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it your way is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll make an episode out of that,
but it's the start of the year coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just make a calendar, because if you
pop a bunch of seeds, you cut a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: clones, and you got a bedroom full and a
flower, and you don't have a full plan of
[SPEAKER_01]: where those plants are going, you're going
to run into some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overcrowding causes problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overcrowding promotes problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see that plan on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell there was a spider mite
infestation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got spider mites everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got way too many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be diligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think ahead of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like five steps ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you'd be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of try to predict what's going to
happen in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just watch and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, oh, this is going to happen
because I've grown weed a million times
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've paid attention to at least 10 of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ranting again, but that's really
important, I think, and it's the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a good time for all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clean up all your shit right at the
start of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your carbon filters are all mucky,
buy some new carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your bulbs are all shitty, get some new
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spoil your gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spoil you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal advice from the heart
of Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must be dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying from the heart of Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wrap up this episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you join me next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be another quick episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go see the string cheese on
the 29th, 30th, and 31st.
[SPEAKER_01]: The string cheese incident at the
Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first bank center in Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to run into me, say,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably wearing an irie genetics
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks
and there's a little short chick with
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks next to me and she's sweet
looking, it's probably me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of people that
want to match that description,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm probably wearing the irie hoodie
and she's probably got the irie hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to remember to take some stickers
or something with me and throw them in my
[SPEAKER_01]: back pocket so that if you say,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a sticker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be really funny when you hug the
wrong hippie because there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of tall white guys with dreadlocks
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what's up to me at the string cheese
incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see me, I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll smoke down or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have some dabs with me if we're not
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I'm going to sneak my rig
into the show, but I'll definitely have a
[SPEAKER_01]: spliff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, happy new year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys might be, when are you listening
to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might hear this on new years,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look at the calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does this come out?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does this come out, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go into the calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to press pause on the
recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try not to do any editing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like it when I just talk a lot and
don't, do you like it when I talk about my
[SPEAKER_01]: life and my stuff and I don't just keep
talking about weed and have it all
[SPEAKER_01]: scripted or do you want me to keep it
tight?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this episode will come out on the 29th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit, you guys are probably,
I hope you're listening to this on your
[SPEAKER_01]: way driving to the cheese show,
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see me at string cheese,
give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next happy new year also, because
Wednesday is the new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys are safe, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drink and drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye out for each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody to be able to see all
your friends again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have a happy new year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to the show.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to change all of that
stuff to grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope all of those services will let me
change my name at least once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how it's going to work,
but I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more focused on these string cheese
concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be gone for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be gone for like four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm more worried about that right now
than I am getting the show stuff done
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't have a logo yet and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I get the logo going,
we'll get it happening at the start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll all be rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay with me, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't abandon me right around episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, follow iregenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going anywhere.

[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk a little bit about my sniffles.

night.

[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love to both or all three of the

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high and stumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get my rhythm in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I want to give a big shout
out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: The song you heard at the opening of the
show was called the Doggy Dub from our
[SPEAKER_01]: good friends, the Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Kat and Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys had a great new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody had a great new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about going to see the
string cheese incident, so we'll talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go see, if you don't know about
the string cheese, they're a jam band from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from the Boulder Estes Park area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from all over the place up there,
so you can't pick one place to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's where they're from,
is that kind of area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started off as kind of a bluegrass
jam band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're kind of more of a psychedelic
dubstep jam band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got two drummers or they've got a
drummer and a guy that plays percussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a keyboard player that tears
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got an electric guitar player who
plays fiddle and electric guitar and
[SPEAKER_01]: mandolin like a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Nershe plays acoustic guitar,
and then their bass player is,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's solid, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't like stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not super flashy, but he never missed
a note in three nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the string cheese incident,
they play, the only way I can describe it,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, is carnival music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's calypso music, it's mambo music,
it's samba, it's rock, it's funk,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's reggae, but it's like one giant
carnival.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole party, the whole concert was one
giant carnival.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw string cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did three nights at the first bank
center in Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we drove up to, it was actually in
Westminster is where our hotel was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we drove up to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stayed in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went and saw the first show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the first set, they do three
nights and the first night they played for
[SPEAKER_01]: about an hour and 15, took a break and
then came out for about another hour and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half and tore that night up.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the first set of the first night,
I said, well, where are they going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they came out and they just tore
it up right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't start like, let's start slow
and build it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they started like, let's come out on
fire and just fuck this all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big thanks to the string cheese
incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So day two, or we finished the show night
one, went back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were beat, pretty much slept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day two, we kind of just hung out in the
hotel and we're lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was minus 16 degrees that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no real reason to leave the
hotel other than to get food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had dabs and drinks and everything we
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just hung out in the hotel until
time for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second night was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty much, we ditched the shows at
the end and had right back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not real party animals anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to eat a bunch of drugs and
get spun out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go home and get prepared for
the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause new years was a big party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started a little bit early and they
played until about 1 45, if I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly, they started at 8 45 and went
to 1 45 with a couple of breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: String cheese incident on new years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen so much confetti,
so many balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even begin to describe what it was
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, me and my girlfriend,
Angela, we're in the front three rows,
[SPEAKER_01]: right in front of Bill Nershey and kind of
off to the side from Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a huge party right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the first or second night,
everybody knew who we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone just treated us like friends
and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all the new friends
and family that I made from the string
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, they had these giant,
they look like cocoons hanging from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we walked in that night and you
couldn't identify what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the midnight countdown began,
these cocoons opened up and there were,
[SPEAKER_01]: they became giant flowers that were lit
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted video on my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to check that out,
you'll have to find my personal Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have said that, but there are
a lot of cool videos of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was covered in confetti.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were so many balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thanks to Angela for letting me go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inviting me to be your New Year's buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for thanks for that sweet New
Year's kiss, babe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to all the cheese kids and fans
that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get some of these
people in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip a bunch though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Pam and Jessica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Pam for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela speaks very highly of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessica, I just met that night,
had never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a big ball of smiley energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to meet you and hang out with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Mama Cass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice lady that calls herself Mama Cass.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a lot of great energy,
had a lot of good things to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to the guy with the amazing
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot remember your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude next to me offered me a lemon
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, is it just candy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, yeah, man, my thing is to
just bring weird candies to the show and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took this lemon candy from him
and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on in the show, he offered me
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he pulled it out of his pocket,
the guy next to him patted me on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulder and said, eat one of those,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I tried it, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some, all the packaging was in
another language.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Chinese or Korean or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry if that's offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what language it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks Chinese to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was mango flavored and whatever I
ate was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did not have drugs in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty relieved about an hour
later when I wasn't flipping my face off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to the candy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a big shout out to Dan, Karen,
Roland, and Riley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure meeting all of my new
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great little family you guys have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a shout out to the girl that we named
Titty Girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never met her.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never met her, but her boobs and her
vibes were amazing and fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was so exposed that my girlfriend told
me to look because it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, look to your left.
[SPEAKER_01]: That girl's boobs are out of her shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked and it was, it wasn't even
like I was looking to be a perv.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more looking like, is she really
having her tits out of her shirt that much
[SPEAKER_01]: at the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of entertaining, kind of
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Titty Girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a good dancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a lot of good energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She brought a little crew of chicks with
her that twirled around and brought a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: little vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, some of the girls at the show,
they wear this eye makeup with beads in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't understand how you ladies do
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got like, I'm serious, like right in
the corner of your eye where you wake up
[SPEAKER_01]: with eye crusties on the outside,
not near your nose, but the other side,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got little beads and shit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how ladies tolerate
that shit all night on your face,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do however think it's cute and I
totally appreciate the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does make me, make me be extra glad
to be the guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up sometimes I do take a shower
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly wake up, put on some clothes,
throw on a t-shirt, shake my head and put
[SPEAKER_01]: on a hat and I'm ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell if I just woke up or if
I've been working all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes me extra grateful to be a guy
that can be lazy, but also thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies for looking great at the cheese
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela, thank you for looking wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for letting me have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did mention I got a little cold,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some sniffles, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sniffled right into the mic to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was rude, but it was minus 16 degrees
one night and you got to go from the car
[SPEAKER_01]: into the concert venue and the minus 16
and then in the concert I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I took off all my jackets and I had my
t-shirt and my pants on and my shoes and
[SPEAKER_01]: my hat and I was sweating my ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to try to negotiate the cold
and then the super hot heat and then back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the car again and then let the car warm
up and get to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think all the climate changes,
I may have got a little cold here and also
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked like 45 joints over three nights
at these concerts where I rolled a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked like 45 joints with strangers and
I'm wondering if maybe I got a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of strange cheese incident wook flu,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some emergency and some yerba mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun meeting a lot of Instagram
followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walked up to me and they said,
hey, are you irie genetics or are you
[SPEAKER_01]: rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always kind of nice when you're
just out randomly somewhere that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: band playing and you're not like,
it wasn't a weed event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have been getting any
attention, but people knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all those folks that
said hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging through notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, huge shout out to Aaron Brooks on the
very last night we were walking out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: venue and if my girlfriend didn't have to
pee, we would not have bumped into each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm so glad she had to pee and I bumped
into Aaron Brooks and got a big old hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron Brooks is an artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not following him, you should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I need to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already 11 minutes in because this
is going to be another one of those short,
[SPEAKER_01]: quick episodes with just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a lot of work into this podcast,
but this week I was obviously busy seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the string cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gone for four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a whole day to get my gardens
back to where I felt they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They missed me and then I needed a day to
get myself back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to record yesterday, but it was
chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recording this quick short episode
because I love you guys and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave you hanging for a whole week,
but I do promise that the next episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be back to what you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: 48, 49 and 50 are going to be stellar
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to get Spencer on pretty soon,
but I never teased you about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm choking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a quick drink here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a dab while I take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shout out to water and root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things keep me alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remind you guys of the name change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my next note.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you noticed at the beginning of
the show that I said, welcome to the iGrow
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best to roll out the new
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it slowly so I don't lose
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it looks confusing for a little bit,
I'm sure you guys are aware of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on if you're listening, but we are
in the process of changing the name from
[SPEAKER_01]: iGrow Culture to Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still could use more logos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody sent me one logo, but I asked for
a couple of adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't fit the way I needed it to fit
to make a squares out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a square logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can send me a 1400 by 1400 pixel
image with the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, I would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also need a song.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody out there is an artist and you
want to make a Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast theme song, I will compensate you
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm starting to change the title in
social media places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm waiting on a couple of artists
to submit some logos that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: commissioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I've got all the artwork,
I can fully roll out the new title and
[SPEAKER_01]: start switching everything over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping by episode 50 that we can
actually just call this the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast and everything will be
switched right over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's something that I've been
considering.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a personal thing for myself
that I'm considering doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may cancel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Instagram for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an iGrowCulture podcast Instagram
that I haven't posted anything to in
[SPEAKER_01]: several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it's just a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of my guests don't want me to
take their picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse doesn't want his face on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam is cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is cool with it, but some people do
not want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I'm just going to overdo
my Instagram presence by having the
[SPEAKER_01]: iRegenetics and the iGrowCulture or the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking about just combining the
two into one entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'll start posting a few things
from the Grow From Your Heart podcast on
[SPEAKER_01]: the iRegenetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not already following
iRegenetics on Instagram, go there and
[SPEAKER_01]: follow that because I'm really considering
taking down the Instagram for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one more thing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also considering, and I'm not
committing to this, but it's highly likely
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody had a talk with me and it got me
thinking, but I'm considering canceling my
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube account for the iGrowCulture Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd say, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, but not as many, and I
appreciate the people that are listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it takes me a long time to get those
episodes up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel if I cancel that, I feel I can
focus more on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't have to create as many
different types of media, I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: better content just for the audio podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather spend the time creating content
instead of editing video and setting up a
[SPEAKER_01]: camera and lighting and editing the video
again, and then rendering the video for
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a few more steps, but all of
those steps matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could spend that much time preparing for
this show and making the show that much
[SPEAKER_01]: better, having that many more details,
being that much more prepared,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that much better of a guest on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Instagram and the YouTube may go
away, and that's just personal things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to free up more time to take
what I'm really passionate about to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to drag my feet on things
that are not fulfilling me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may eliminate those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do appreciate the guys that watch me
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only gotten like 17 or 18,
maybe 20 videos up on YouTube because like
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, it takes me an hour to make each
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I could, I'm repeating
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just spend that time doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may take them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to abandon people,
but if you are watching on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be able to find it on the
iGrowCulture or the iRead Genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every podcast is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a browser, it works the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not missing anything visually
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are mostly distractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm going to stop contributing
to those just so that I can improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: audio part of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I'm talking about that for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the emails I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue to use the
iGrowCulture at hotmail.com email address
[SPEAKER_01]: for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: By episode 50, I will have created the new
email address and I'll start talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can email me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from now on, or for now, keep using
the iGrowCulture at hotmail.com email
[SPEAKER_01]: address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did change the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still at iGrowCulture, but if you
look at it, the name is Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't let me change my at name,
only my display name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something you can pay attention
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote a bunch of notes and I have them
in my computer and I'm scrolling through
[SPEAKER_01]: the computer and looking at a piece of
paper, trying to read two things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's honestly not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So episode 50 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning a small celebration episode,
but I would like your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked for this on the last episode,
but I want to know who your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: guests were.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your favorite moments
and what did you learn and what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: like to hear next?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, send me some input.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tweet me or you can find me on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I need to change the
Facebook also, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still iGrowCulture, but pretty
soon it's going to be the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart Podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I... Crap, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I got you guys caught up on
all of the stuff I had to remind you of
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I think it's time to read a couple
of news articles that I picked out for the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says, Colorado seeks federal okay
for state colleges to grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people from out of state are
going, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written by John Engold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says,
[SPEAKER_01]: In a letter sent last month, the state
attorney general's office asks federal
[SPEAKER_01]: health and education officials for
permission on Colorado's colleges and
[SPEAKER_01]: universities to obtain marijuana from
non-federal government resources for
[SPEAKER_01]: research purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The letter isn't more specific on how the
state's higher education institutions
[SPEAKER_01]: might score weed, but it was sent pursuant
to a law passed in 2014 requiring state
[SPEAKER_01]: officials to ask that Colorado colleges
and universities be allowed to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and its component parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Current research is riddled with bias or
insufficiencies and often conflict with
[SPEAKER_01]: one another, reads the letter written by
Deputy Attorney General David Blake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is critical that we be allowed to fill
the void of scientific research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this may only be done with your
assistance and cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The request is not a long shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: While marijuana is, with qualifications,
legal in Colorado, it remains illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: under federal law, and getting permission
to conduct research on cannabis requires
[SPEAKER_01]: clearing a set of high hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approval from multiple federal agencies
and strict requirements on how marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: must be handled and stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researchers that work without the federal
government's blessing risk losing crucial
[SPEAKER_01]: federal funding for their institutions,
not to mention possible imprisonment.
[SPEAKER_01]: An international treaty that the United
States signed onto, sorry, I'm stumbling,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high, signed onto requires the federal
government to designate only one place in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country that can legally grow
marijuana for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1968, that place has been the
University of Mississippi's National Care
[SPEAKER_01]: for Natural Products Research,
which cultivates cannabis on a 12-acre
[SPEAKER_01]: plot and sends it to approved researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, that 12-acre plot is rumored to be
where the G13 came from many years ago out
[SPEAKER_01]: of University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know anything about that,
send me some info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article goes on to say,
coincidentally, the National Institute on
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug Abuse recently put the government's
pot farm contract up for rebid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Applicants need to have 12 acres of
secured and video monitored outdoor space
[SPEAKER_01]: and 1,000 feet of indoor space to grow
marijuana to be able to make marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions, test for potency,
and prepare, preferably by hand rolling a
[SPEAKER_01]: small batch of marijuana cigarettes,
according to the official solicitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contract's winner is expected to be
announced in the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spokeswoman for the National Institute
of Drug Abuse would not say how many
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions applied for the contract or
where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spokesman for the University of Colorado
and Colorado State University said their
[SPEAKER_01]: schools did not apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Drug Enforcement Administration in
2014 massively increased the amount of pot
[SPEAKER_01]: the government's official supplier can
grow from 21 kilos to 650 kilos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The increase was the result of a boom in
marijuana research interest, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Mississippi has pledged to
grow new strains of marijuana to give
[SPEAKER_01]: research more options for their studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a long time ago, there was a video out,
a movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot recall the name of the movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something like The Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been in The Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been How Weed Won the West,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name of which movie
it was, but they actually showed us inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of this facility in Mississippi where they
grow this cannabis, and it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't growing high grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bitch about the weed at the
dispensaries, and I would rather smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed at the dispensaries than the bullshit
that I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being grown at University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really cool that they're doing
the research with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they get, I hope since then they've
gotten a real grower and they've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: some genetics and they've learned a few
things is what I saw was shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says still the Colorado Attorney
General's letter says the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government falls short of being able to
supply researchers with the kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: products available in Colorado's
commercial marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_01]: State health officials have just approved
up to 8.4 million dollars in grants for
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana studies, some of which will
examine Colorado-specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Attorney General's office says
more needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the support of our federal
partners to overcome the inertia that
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to complicate state efforts in
this area, the letter states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like they caught on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that we've got the dank here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know they need to examine
Colorado-specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they are catching on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they know that that stuff that
they're growing out there at that
[SPEAKER_01]: university is a bunch of mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of mids, shout out to my buddy
Vigorlover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this says, this article,
I want to talk about this a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are actually asking the federal
government to let the state colleges or
[SPEAKER_01]: higher educational centers in Colorado to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there will be courses or a
class that is accredited to a college
[SPEAKER_01]: where somebody is growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be a chemistry
class or a biology class.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably won't be a horticulture class
because they're not worried about growing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more worried about the effects and
science and they know how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are going to probably have some
students doing, making extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure what they're going to
do, but I'm impressed and I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this works because I would love to
see cannabis grown in a university and
[SPEAKER_01]: tested here in Colorado where we're not
scared and trying to lie about all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: results and to see possibly some of my
friends that are college students able to
[SPEAKER_01]: study cannabis in this way in a college
and actually get college credit and build
[SPEAKER_01]: a future for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love that cannabis has kind of
opened doors and gone from us hiding to
[SPEAKER_01]: letting us kind of make a living for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This demographic, this age group of 25 to
40 year old males, and there are females
[SPEAKER_01]: in there too, but honestly the majority is
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were broke and now the 25 to 40 year
old demographic has something to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow great cannabis and get in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another news article,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm going really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some yerba mate and I'm drinking
a root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I just need to slow down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 25 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a short episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I promised you that anyway,
so it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this article on the cannabis as
well and I found it entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, it's actually a long article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only want to read one piece of it to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says cannabis Q and A, naming strains
and federal rescheduling riddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part I want to read about is naming
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from, it's by Susan Squibb on the
cannabis staff and the header is,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome to our cannabis column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our ask the cannabis column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly you have questions about my
marijuana, be it a legal concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: a health curiosity, a Colorado centric
inquiry, or something more far reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out our expansive 100 question,
Colorado marijuana, frequently asked
[SPEAKER_01]: questions first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're still curious, email your
questions to the cannabis at, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's ask the cannabis at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to participate in that,
feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of my new stuff from these
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So participate with them if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question got my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey cannabis, why would someone
name a strain of weed after a bioweapon
[SPEAKER_01]: that killed thousands of people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they signed the letter put off
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy's asking, why would somebody
name a strain of weed after a bioweapon
[SPEAKER_01]: that killed thousands of people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis replies, you must be
talking about agent orange, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear your concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain names can mean one thing to a
potential customer and something else to a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeder naming the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: While agent orange is not a peaceful,
happy, or euphoric name.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you view it in historical context,
there is the other view that the name
[SPEAKER_01]: suggests an orange scent and the potency
is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article says, I chatted with Adam
Dunn, host of the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Mitch?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Adam?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody on the show,
crunchy bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys are all doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but Adam is the founder of the
Amsterdam based seed company, TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, having owned a seed company
myself for 21 years, I can attest that
[SPEAKER_01]: many cannabis seed companies are run by
people who have a bit more of a juvenile
[SPEAKER_01]: attitude, especially when it comes to name
to the names game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunn says,
[SPEAKER_01]: Often strain names are creative,
uh, often strains are creative
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations of the names that make up the
genetic lineage or other plant attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Dunn says, having been there at the
naming of AK 47 and my own MK ultra,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am guilty of joining the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunn says, I was dead wrong back in 1993
when I said AK 47 was a terrible name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was named for flowering on 47 days and
AK 47 went on to become one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: famous strains in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with the start of the legal adult use
market this year, the reactions of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to strain names is a recent
development in marijuana marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunn points out, Dunn points out that,
the cannabis industry is very young and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go through many changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I am guilty of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why it got me attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a strain called bounty killer,
and I had a friend named Nancy tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: that she didn't really like the name and
she was reluctant to grow it because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was called bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I called it bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it's named after one of my
favorite reggae artists is named bounty
[SPEAKER_01]: killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he, I liked the way he does things and
I wanted to kind of honor him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Capleton, which is also named
after a reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the Kalanji Kush,
which is also named after a reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the night nurse is named after a
reggae song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I called bounty killer,
bounty killer after the reggae artist is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it grows killer weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kick your ass and it grows huge
colas and huge harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the bounty there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't know about reggae,
it sounds like you're reaping the bounty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're killing that huge harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you know reggae, you know that it's
the bounty killer and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive and kind of bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of loud and it's got a groovy
beat to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I call it the bounty
killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I wanted to talk about why I named
things the way I name them and why,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, strains I've created have the names
they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm a grateful dead fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dead head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm kind of, uh, ended like the whole
spiritual side of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely a Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why my company is called Irene
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I try to honor the parents,
uh, the parent plants that I'm using when
[SPEAKER_01]: I create a new strain, but sometimes that
just gets redundant and you can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to draw from Rasta culture,
grateful dead culture, and like positive
[SPEAKER_01]: loving hippie culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I've got a strain called heart
of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's the golden goat crossed to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost got called horn dog,
but that didn't sound as good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to promote a heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke that weed and you meditate,
your heart is calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your heart is filled with love.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's better than a heart of gold,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a big heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just pumping love and positive
energy and it's got golden goat in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, lemon Jeffrey is golden goat crossed
to the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so there's lemon, obviously the lemon,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my name is Jeff and I wanted something
like, uh, you got Ariane's haze and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not have a lemon Jeffrey that's named
after me, the guy that made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of my little stingy move on
the cannabis world there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these guys were talking about agent
orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who made agent orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's orange velvet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an orange velvet to Jack the ripper
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think agent orange was a perfect
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just said another name,
Jack the ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's Jack Herrera crossed to other
stuff basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sub cool didn't want to use the name
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Jack the ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, that's how these names come
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've got a strain that, uh,
I wanted to call it the golden road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a golden goat cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course that's a grateful dead song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my names come from trying to honor the
parents strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I did get creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm going to say this name here.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the show that it's not out yet,
but I've, this is my cross, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four crossed to the grateful dog is
called grip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where my skateboard friends,
you know, what grip tape is on your
[SPEAKER_01]: skateboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit that makes your feet stick to
the board a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I call it grip tape because it is
sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it would be called fly paper,
but fly papers already taken and grip tape
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of honors my skateboard friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the names come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just spouting out random shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys are one of my best sellers
lately has actually been a strain that's
[SPEAKER_01]: called blue healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was named by our good buddy Spence
from the garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually blue dream crossed to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grateful dog gives you a dog name,
the blue blue healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's named after a dog to keep the
grateful dog reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also got the word healer in there
because it's going to make you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just me trying to be silly and
trying to be creative and honor the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to name it something,
you know, you can't just call it X five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can, but that would be bold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boring, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enough of that article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to talk about how I named
strains and why I named them, what I named
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave me like anything that I
crossed to ghost OG, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: called ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever I crossed it to, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghost dog, ghost goat, the golden ghost,
you know, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, uh, if I cross golden goat to
stuff, it probably got the word goal to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been going for 32 minutes,
you guys, but, uh, I don't have a lot else
[SPEAKER_01]: to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly didn't have time to prepare for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I didn't want to stress out over
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hang out with you guys,
take a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ramble here while you guys
get a dab together to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am proud because I'm going to dab
shatter that I made myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made hash and then spins vac purged it
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I got it in there and got it going,
but I had to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he finished it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff got purged for 35 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty damn dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a dab ready by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab together and then we'll
start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit the, uh, I've got the
Hitman E series sidecar with a highly
[SPEAKER_01]: educated infinity nail on it attached to
the highly educated infinity nail is the
[SPEAKER_01]: emo tech, uh, G nail that's always on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got mine set to eight 50 right now,
which people say is kind of high,
[SPEAKER_01]: but honestly, if I put it any lower,
I don't get a big chunky dab when I carb
[SPEAKER_01]: cap it.

[SPEAKER_00]: If a bike I'd be the rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If MC business was a church, Pato would be

would call me preacher.

[SPEAKER_07]: Monday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: 7-10 in the morning, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got people asking me already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys are following everybody on
Instagram and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, we just took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give Spence a huge shout out on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence taught me how to make my own dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to learn from one of who I
consider the masters and also a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's about time you have great
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in turn, that's going to make great
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to brag on Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell a story about Maddie,
introduce you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie and Spence hang out together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I met them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one time, Spence made Earl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maddie, she's great at it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took that Pyrex dish that had a little
bit of BHO left in the bottom that we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't feel like scraping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she decided to heat it up and make
brownies in that pan with the BHO mix in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's laughing because Spence and I
are on the six, four, six, five level of
[SPEAKER_01]: life, close to 200 pounds each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was another guy and another guy
in the room that's about the same weight
[SPEAKER_01]: class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she fucking wrecked four dudes,
maybe five or six dudes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't even know that it was going
to be that potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole outer layer of the brownie was
literally covered in a layer of shatter
[SPEAKER_09]: almost.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it coated inside of the brownie,
but it worked itself in perfectly to where
[SPEAKER_09]: it got us all so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was scary.
You could taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a pineapple upside down cake
layer of hash on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tasty, but God, I was high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to leave about 30 minutes after I
ate that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt my arms drooping and I was like,
I got to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody went to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, back in the day, that was the only
way I could really utilize a Pyrex dish
[SPEAKER_09]: without wasting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So- So you said back in the day,
I'm going to ask a tech question now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely do not blast into a Pyrex dish
or use a Pyrex dish in our process anymore
[SPEAKER_09]: at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's closed loop and use parchment
when we process it to go through the back
[SPEAKER_09]: of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no Pyrex dish needed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys taught me a way to do it and
there's no Pyrex dish involved in how I
[SPEAKER_01]: was taught, which is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are fucking bad-ass at what
they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming, you guys,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence was like, what are we going to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, he kind of said, let's do a
year in review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that would be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that stood out to me to is
you got super fucking sick at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You back, you like a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you 95?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You look good, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You look good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gained all my weight back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm skinny, so I lost a bunch of weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Being skinny and losing a bunch of weight
ain't really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you looked, uh, you looked anorexic and
scary skinny for a minute there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had everybody worried.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we realized in 2014 health is one
of the most important things that we have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking care of our bodies is really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word should happen on the computer here,
but it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're recording.
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking care of our bodies is really
important.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with him getting so sick, now we're
trying to get them back together and get
[SPEAKER_09]: them healthy and gaining some more weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Eating properly is one thing we've kind of
clicked into doing recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking great care of yourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the gym too now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this will be Spencer's first time
going to the gym today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I got them long spaghetti arms and
spaghetti legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how it feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go exercise in front of
anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's plan of fitness though.
[SPEAKER_09]: They accept everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's in our location, there are a
lot of large people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure you guys don't even look that
silly there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking good at the gym.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about to look like an Olympic
athlete out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're both like, damn, he's in the NBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you're the only black person around
here, if you go by the college,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're not a lot of black folk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should wear your grill to the gym and
just go hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go hard all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stun on him at the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lost your grill?
[SPEAKER_08]: He loses on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a different shelf for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a different pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're back to health,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot to mention, Maddie grew my
Girl Scout cookies times King Kim Grape
[SPEAKER_01]: Stomper OG cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I had two different phenos.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had four plants altogether, but two
phenos of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one got huge and the nodes were really
far away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally different color.
[SPEAKER_09]: The smaller plant, the other phenom turned
purple at the end of flower, but was super
[SPEAKER_09]: frosty.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one wasn't as frosty though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that thing is ever going
to get to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might just be something that
the crew around here gets to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did a good job with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the owner to say that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a year in review, both of you guys
are involved in these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can both have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take turns.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your favorite strains to
grow since we're all growers in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might answer on some of these
questions too, since we'll do a year in
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think at the beginning of the year,
I was still stuck on the whole Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_07]: cookie thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And anything Girl Scout cookies,
I was kind of running through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still currently still have a lot of
different, you know, just different unique
[SPEAKER_07]: cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I grew that Yeti OG and that kind of
put me on to the OG side of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I've been kind of tracking and
trying to find different strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I picked up Triangle the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another good one to have around.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd probably say Yeti is probably my
favorite plant of the year to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say that's the one Jesse
found for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's your favorite oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like one of my favorite oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my follow-up questions was
going to be, do you prefer to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff for oil to if you're going
to smoke it for flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow it for yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow a different strain and then
grow different for Earl?
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times oil is just depending on
what we think we have available at the
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like if we have certain strains that we
know that are better in oil than they are
[SPEAKER_07]: in flour, we'll make oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then same like we have Kanatonic right
now, which we're going to split and do
[SPEAKER_07]: some oil and then some like capsules.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a little bit of mix of- Oh
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I feel real high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also gave me two of those hash
capsules right before we started the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it in my eyes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, how, why am I getting heavy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kanatonic, is that the super high CBD
strain?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a crazy high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a three to one THC or CBD to THC
ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nice and- Great medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll make great medicine for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to take it to, do you have a
specific patient in mind or a type of
[SPEAKER_01]: patient like an epileptic or someone with
MS or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple of people who are also
like cancer patients that I want to try to
[SPEAKER_07]: get some stuff to and see if, you know,
just it's not going to hurt to give it a
[SPEAKER_07]: try, especially when it's, you know,
you're fighting cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might as well try all you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool that you guys help people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys came from North Carolina and
set up shop in Colorado and they give away
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people to be able to move out of,
from out of state and do that is really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool because there are a lot of people
that are really stingy with what they
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just love to share with other people
and show people what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you guys are so well known
because you share and you're super kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think why we moved from North Carolina
is because I wanted to, when I lived in
[SPEAKER_07]: North Carolina, I wanted to tell everybody
I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was illegal, but I was like,
yo, come look at this room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'd crack the door open and people
would be like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think there is a UFO in our closet
or something?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then now when you're here, you know,
there's so many people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like you, you do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, let me see your weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, you know, everything's
common.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I do wish, I do wish the barter
system was pot was a little bit better
[SPEAKER_07]: because it would take money out of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could just go to the restaurant and
pay for it in an eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple of places you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who it's from, but there was
a New York city diesel fino we had,
[SPEAKER_09]: and it tastes like, and smells like red
wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had put it in this big circle jar
and all of our friends, including me,
[SPEAKER_09]: would just literally stick their faces in
it for hours and just talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the oil from it was even crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazier.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just had such a potent flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was almost, you had to mix it with
something else to kind of dial it down a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then definitely at the end of the
year, one of my last favorites is a
[SPEAKER_09]: tangerine haze times the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found out that I have two packages
of that in my little vault and that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're looking at me like,
well, let's you run it and give me clones
[SPEAKER_01]: of the keeper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, we were in the middle of a
process where we didn't know what we were
[SPEAKER_09]: doing with our garden or if we were
relocating.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I decided not to take clones of it,
which was a huge mistake because I had a
[SPEAKER_09]: fino that was heavier in the white and had
a really good flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The oil of course is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangerine oil tastes crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave me a couple of dabs of this
tangerine oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you, I've got two packs of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a pack, maybe both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You run them and you find that tangerine
fino and then you give me a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that'll be a good trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a keeper out of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice tangerine flavored one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe I'll breed to that
tangerine flavored female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was definitely one of my
favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from a down with dirt seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Riley.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great strain, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually if you breed to the white,
it either comes out nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't get any flavor or you get
all that dank.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had, yeah, like I said, I had one
fino that came out a really strong white
[SPEAKER_09]: flavor and the tangerine was still there,
but it was definitely a back note to it,
[SPEAKER_09]: which was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you were giving me dabs of was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, y'all got some more of those
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, bye Felicia.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really have any left at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's sad conserving them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good dabs go away quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to conserve what I made
and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to dab the shit out of my dabs
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to take a dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep saying the D word so many times.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to take a dab of?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got the Yeti OG over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of live that I got
from my good friend Spence a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the gorilla haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've also got some, some of the
shatter that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's parchment paper y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine the size of parchment that it
takes to make that sound.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty big rip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice piece of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you got that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicely medicated, highly educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next question that I want to talk about
for the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might mention a couple of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to talk about my own
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should, but that feels the lemon
Jeffrey, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you grow anything that you,
where's a few strains you grew this year
[SPEAKER_07]: that you don't?
[SPEAKER_01]: That white widow that I got from Spence
was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the platinum emoji.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some of it over there in a jar
curing still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a bunch of that to the string
cheese show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I would light it, the people
around me would be like, the glue came
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everybody's impressed with what it
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took cuts to grow it again a couple more
times because I definitely want to put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bigger pot and give it more love,
more training, more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you grow the gorilla glue,
feed the shit out of that plant early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just overfeed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're going to fuck it up in
week four, feed it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just feed it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got to say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll ask a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your biggest growing
evolutions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorites is lemon Jeffrey,
the white widow and the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll settle on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Yeti, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was some of your favorite,
biggest growing evolutions that you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: made at the Garden of Weedon this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of know what you're going to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give a shout out to
somebody after you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you want to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cage thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, yeah, we kind of change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with, you know, stuff changing and
like regulation and laws and stuff like
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you kind of got to change with the
game.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're kind of instead of doing a
room full of multiple plants, we're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: less plants, same space, but just bigger,
longer veg plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really get to take care of a lot of,
you know, get to spend more time with each
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, work on canopy management,
you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to green works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out right there on my paper
brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to green works because I knew
that's where this conversation was headed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have really set up an awesome plan
for their grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people are catching on to
what they're doing because with the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: count now, we have to do something.
[SPEAKER_09]: So bigger is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, it's scary to see these
plant count limitations come in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but luckily I just teamed up with the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to do some breeding in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are those cages, pretty much your
biggest evolution of growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a lot of tea stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You advanced your teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the alfalfa sprouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some shit like that happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did we do this year?
[SPEAKER_07]: We did the barley straw that has like
natural barley straw, barley seeds and it
[SPEAKER_07]: grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a lot of stuff with a... Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grokashi like... That was a big hit this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of Grokashi is a big hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just kind of going back,
a lot of going back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody went to Gavitas and
analysis, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Gavita.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking about the light that
Jesse gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not even be able to run it,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grow room's got like a seven foot
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow my plants to usually five and a
half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been told that you got to keep
the plants three feet from those lights or
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll burn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say you will burn them
because there's probably a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: strains that could grow closer than three
feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just think it would definitely
stress them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just too much spectrum and too much
just... Man, if you've never been under
[SPEAKER_07]: Gavitas or anything like that,
you know how powerful they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the spot they just hired me at,
the spot, there's 227 Gavitas and they
[SPEAKER_01]: turn on a small portion and it's like,
yeah, it's like you just woke up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they about to buy you a Method 7?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Method 7?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are listening, I could use a
sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they about to buy you at the spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they said they would, but I mean
still, if I can get them on the DL from
[SPEAKER_01]: the discount or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm trying to get them for the low.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to cop up here wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Harvest Honey, head of Harvest
Honey, she'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Harvest Honey, I don't mean to bust
you out on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I do because she's trying to be
Miss High Time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check her out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say vote for her, but check her
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give her a good run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just at Greenworks on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, he's going to search right quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the guys that kind of inspired the
idea for Spence's Cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single Plant Scrogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Single Plant Scrogs in gigantic
containers.
[SPEAKER_09]: But did you tell them how we switched ours
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: People have seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, check out Garden of Weed on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of using the big squares.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to copy my man shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We switched ours up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do your own OG status.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the plug on the Scrogs
though.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is green underscore works underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have an awesome feed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make sure you follow Garden of Weed N.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't follow one of the fake Garden of
Weedens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for pictures of these folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't follow the bunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of the bunk Garden of
Weedens and they always send me messages
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't reply because I don't want to
be a hater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure that you find a picture of
... Spence is a six foot, six foot four,
[SPEAKER_01]: six foot five black guy with a beard and
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if there's not pictures of that
dude on there, don't follow that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Maddie's a pretty lady and
they're standing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's easy to spot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably hitting at an expensive
rig or taking too big of a dab in the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an expensive rig.
[SPEAKER_09]: At least we know we worked hard for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying you guys are always at the
... Not just your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are all the cool events and shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're so lucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have so many friends with awesome toys
that we get to play with.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry is so great when you make
friends in this community slash industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to hit so many cool rigs and smoke
so much great hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's your little ... Master Shake?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's up on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good competition there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Shake against the rig that Spence
brought over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who made that rig you brought?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know his name, but it's BC Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a Quave Club banger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a banger on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This motherfucker.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing kicks you right in the dick and
smiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at you like, you should name it
Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the guy from The Simpsons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should name it Nelson because it's
just like ... Hits you and just kicks you
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the dick and laughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great rig, but I'm kind of offended
by the way it hit me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to look at it a second time and
reconsider if I wanted to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wanted to hit it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will hit it again, but God damn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tap that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't scurred.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spicy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked kind of about growing
evolutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't change too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning more about breeding and I
learned that one of the methods I tried,
[SPEAKER_01]: I overdid it and I don't need to apply so
damn much because it fucked up my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to ... I make my own silver
thiosulfate and I applied way too many
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and I learned that if you
overdo it, it just pisses the plants off
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't get enough pollen and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my growing evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who'd you guys notice this year other than
Greenworks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who stood out in the weed community?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk about good and or bad stuff
because you covered your face like you
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking were like, well, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give a shout out to all the people
that are not necessarily going away from
[SPEAKER_07]: bottle nutrients, but people who are
expanding their grow game into
[SPEAKER_07]: biologicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually just in Denver on Monday
and I got to meet up with the microfusion
[SPEAKER_07]: guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some bags of microfusion for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then shout out to the Mills guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always hooking me up when I see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like you're impressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just started and honestly, we're really
impressed so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you use it back in the day too one
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I used ... What was that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your homies used it on Instagram,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to follow somebody that talked
about Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of your guys's.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are still talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's doing something right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a friend in Seattle that started
using it and she raved about it for
[SPEAKER_09]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Her plants were beautiful too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she is all about Mills.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when he started talking about it,
well, I talked to her a lot a bit about it
[SPEAKER_09]: and she said it was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we went ahead and got samples.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when we met them and they teamed
up with microfusion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing something together now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's biologicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Their line is now teamed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have their whole feeding chart
with the microfusion mixed in also.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these days soon, we're going to
make a field trip, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be Spence and Jesse and
myself and Matty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come too if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go to the Worm Company in
Springs, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[SPEAKER_01]: and go visit Jay and stock up on some
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some worm poop.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to cross somebody out over a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's playing fucking basketball in my
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the organic growers like Probiotics
Farmers Alliance, those types of guys who
[SPEAKER_01]: were shot out for who we noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also noticed a lot in Colorado this
year, Miss Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know her personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't met her yet, but we haven't met
her yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her and the local people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won the Amsterdam Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Jess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met her one time on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a beer rig and I had the purple
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it sitting there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was sitting across the table dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had my shirt on and she complimented
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you want to hit it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she goes, you're that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she recognized me from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's awesome is everybody at the Secret
Cup, a lot of people had ran her Kong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Miss Green Thumb on Instagram
and check out her Kong on her feed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so awesome when everyone's saying
compliments to the grower, Miss Green
[SPEAKER_09]: Thumb.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she got a lot of recognition for her
work this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So compliments to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grew arms the size of my arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her butt's the size of my arms.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and her are probably some of the two
best female growers that I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a hell of a compliment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can get her on the podcast one
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told her she can come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people live in Denver and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to drive down to this town
to be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, the dangerous city in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably been like fucking 10 years
in a row.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so frustrating though, because it's
not like every day there's just violent
[SPEAKER_09]: crimes right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just because of the population.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the people that other people are
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mind my own business and I don't have
any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess since we're talking about
fucking the town and stuff that we see,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: After seeing it's been a full year of
legalization, like a year and five days
[SPEAKER_01]: now since we've legalized recreational
adult use cannabis in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the moment that you could buy a
weed at a store in Colorado, but after
[SPEAKER_01]: this full year, how do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what have you seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it make a difference?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are from a whole other state.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the regulations are shitty,
but it's stuff that has to be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the country wants to use Colorado or
Washington as an example to go legal
[SPEAKER_07]: across the board, it's going to have to be
regulated like it, if it wants to be
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So eventually it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks for small people like myself who
are small business, mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to be small business and it
kind of got squished.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always remember, go to the mom and pops.
[SPEAKER_07]: You always find better stuff there than
you will the big store, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the spot first.
[SPEAKER_07]: The spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Maddie, what did you notice
over the last year?
[SPEAKER_09]: So many people from out of state are
flooding into Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't say anything negative about that
at all because I moved here two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not being hateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's North Carolina and Texas that have
moved here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just because you know us.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only reason North Carolina is
because we are all from there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you brought the town of Dixie with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie is empty now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dust and fucking tumbleweeds in Dixie
because y'all left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of our friends though learned how
to grow amazing weed this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of our friends really caught on
quickly and learned a lot from us and also
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Instagram is not only a social
network, a great media to learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your guys' table at the new and the old
house is part of what started me thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about I should do something because I
would go to your place and guys at Spence
[SPEAKER_01]: and Maddie's old place and the new place,
but people would fly from North Carolina
[SPEAKER_01]: and come visit these guys and just hang
out for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I would show up to come dab them
out and kind of maybe give them some iry
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and a t-shirt and some stickers for
visiting and maybe a hat pin, they would
[SPEAKER_01]: start asking weed questions and no shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 guys came and nine of them asked the
same exact first three questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I should just record this
somewhere and play it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, here is my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an automated weed service or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got good at talking to people at the
table and talking about growing weed like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your guys' table kind of opened
this up a little bit.
Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our table is a hot topic because we're
always just taking dabs and talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: different growing subjects.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's always so many different
people there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always something to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a crazy mix of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black guy, Mexican guy, white guy,
Persian girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's an Asian guy from his
Vietnamese dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got a couple of white dudes,
a couple of chihuahuas, people that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't even tell what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice mix of people over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, people just flood in when
there's legal weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_09]: We come from a place where you can't have
more than a gram on you without possibly
[SPEAKER_09]: going to jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you get a citation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if it's under an eighth or half
eighth or something like that,
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's more, you have the possibility
of going to jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still real in places here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so free.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going home at the end of the month
and so most nervous.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nerve wracking because we can't be
ourselves there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're so used to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's so easy going and free here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm staying inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: People forget that there's an open
container law that applies to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to have your weed in a
container that's sealed up and out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably supposed to be in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I put mine, I've got an SUV so
my trunk, I can reach the trunk in my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can reach everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking six five and I have an SUV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter where I put it, so I put it
in the backpack in a container and my dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: are always out of reach and in the back
seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there may have been car dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be a smart ass and ask why he
had to know what time it was, but none of
[SPEAKER_01]: my jokes are going to be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're going to get swole up tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, get blazed and then you'll work your
ass shit heavier when you're high though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't going to lift too much today.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know what you're going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to run a mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 30 minutes later, what are you going
to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Spencer quit smoking cigarettes this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good change for the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Team Whedon all quit smoking cigarettes
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When everybody got sick, everybody got
like deathly ill at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys all were like,
fuck cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he came back strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a big accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely dabs taste completely different
once you get your full palate back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I still haven't gotten my full one back,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spencer used to smoke Newport's.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it'll come back within
like two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll shout out to Newport.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got me through some years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through some stressful times.
[SPEAKER_07]: My life is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only black person in this town and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we didn't see after
legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of crime, a whole bunch of
murder, a whole bunch of rape,
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole bunch of little kids running
around smoking spliffs, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: people walking in the park just getting
high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is there to fight over when it's
legal?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't understand why other states
don't follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie's got a point, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in another state, fucking
legalize weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize cannabis around the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to lower crime and have less
people in jail for pointless crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make some money off of cannabis taxes
because the state of Colorado makes a shit
[SPEAKER_01]: ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could Google it, but that'll give me
sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a whole shit ton of money off
legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just released everything since it's
2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably try to do that on episode 49
or 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get Mike here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's good with numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make it sound eloquent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been working hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Adam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse?
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole crew, Tony, they all been
working their asses off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting some shit done.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I supposed to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish, cut faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I'm supposed to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They listen to the podcast at the work
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish, do something, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking do something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play Xbox later, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full year of legalization and nobody's
been fucking raped and killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kids with joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's my next question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Garden of Weedon, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys won a bunch of awards this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your proudest
achievements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I just got deep on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to go through a lot of hardships
this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely getting our win for Secret
Cut Mountain was awesome for us,
[SPEAKER_09]: pulling everything together and getting
our entry right and perfecting live resin
[SPEAKER_09]: or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you'd consider it
perfecting, but working on- We just got
[SPEAKER_01]: really good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are part of the pioneering team.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to perfect live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, but I've been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit's good enough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it was so awesome to win the
Secret Cut because we were with all of our
[SPEAKER_09]: friends and it was an awesome competition.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fair in my opinion,
because you have, for if anybody doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: know, you have a box with- how many
entries were there this year?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there were 32 maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 something.
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 something.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just cool because you get to compete
with, especially Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado's the first place to do weed
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you got, it's supposed to be the
Mecca of oil makers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's cool to try to win that or win it
for Colorado and compete against people
[SPEAKER_07]: who, cushy candy just won the Amsterdam
Cup with the Kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was standing there, I was standing
next to my girl and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: when Big D announced it, he was like,
you all know who won first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know who it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel dumb because I was like,
well- Please tell us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, then that made me think,
well, obviously it's not Spence because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something that would be, it's going
to be one of those popular guys that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: stickers everywhere and fucking everyone
knows him and they were all high fiving
[SPEAKER_01]: him as he walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I didn't fucking see Bomb
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he's like, fucking Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, all I could say was,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just looked at my girl like,
but really?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys walked up to the front and
she's like, shouldn't she go up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, let my homie have his
minute for a minute, like let him do his
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone in the crowd is looking
at me like, dude, they moved out of my way
[SPEAKER_01]: so that I could walk up towards you guys
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just go hang out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so shocked.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had, I had no idea we were going to win.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they called three and two,
I was like, fuck, we have lost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and Maddie were literally standing
right next to each other and they did like
[SPEAKER_07]: all like the lower, the next bottom
awards, not bottom, but like- Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't win none of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they did third place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was, who was third place?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind Bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind Bill was third place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then second place was Cushy Candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I looked at Maddie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, we ain't winning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he, he went through that whole
round when I was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on your face was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were kind of in shock for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Maddie was- Spencer was so
shocked, he didn't even know what to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he just had to, you know, his speech
was great though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about running from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I looked here to do this and I did
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: The best part about it is we had all of
our friends pretty much from North
[SPEAKER_09]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're at the event with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the best thing is to win with the
people beside you that you started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people thought that I grew that
material and I had to correct a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them because Spencer was wearing his ivory
genetics hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so was Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just rocked that shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so comfy, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are some great hoodies.
[SPEAKER_09]: The logo is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine's in the washer right now though,
getting cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to move them because I got a,
I got the dog hair situation going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the dogs in Siroc.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Jerry boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you listening?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stella, are you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proudest achievements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, winning that secret cup,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the other stuff you guys keep
winning on Thursday nights?
[SPEAKER_07]: We won a top shelf Thursday in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's multiple social clubs in Denver
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're ever bored and you want to go
smoke somewhere, just drive to Denver and
[SPEAKER_07]: Google social smoke club.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one particular is in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one's in Aurora off of Colfax.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called 710 Social Lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Ink Therapy either one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to remember those.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can pay like a member price.
[SPEAKER_07]: You pay like 25 bucks and then you can go
in there for any time you want for a month
[SPEAKER_07]: and smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And last month they did or last time they
did a 16 person bracket.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it broke all the way down to the
finals and then I won the finals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a free rig, got a bunch of stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're doing another round and now
it's 32 people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a bigger bracket.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they wanted me to do it, but I want to
focus more on growing weed this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still make oil, but I want to focus
on making sure my weeds at where it should
[SPEAKER_07]: be at before I even make oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see, that's why I wasn't even making
oil before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to breed and make sure that shit
was on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do that and let you hash makers make
my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was working well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a lot of fun making a hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, one thing with all these competitions
this year also, we met a lot of amazing
[SPEAKER_09]: people in Denver specifically,
because when we used to go to Denver,
[SPEAKER_09]: we used to not really know that many
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when we started going to the
social club, we kind of connected with a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are new to Colorado,
that's a good opportunity to meet a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: other fellow dabbers or even if you're
just somebody that's in a 710 or 420
[SPEAKER_07]: community and you're from Colorado and you
want other people to smoke with,
[SPEAKER_07]: like feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find us at like, I'll be at the cannabis
cup for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really rep the high times events,
but I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the high times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's April 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the 18th, 19th and 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three days this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of dope ass events planned
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not have a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was offered a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I declined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather roam around and do a task rock
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take my backpack and do what I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more fun that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I feel tied down when I have a
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can walk around and go see who I want to
and then get the fuck out when I'm ready
[SPEAKER_06]: and then actually enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a booth in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to invest into that and be
tied down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have some employees that'll run
the booth the whole time for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want before I'm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking forward to me having
a booth at the cup, I apologize,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm really tall and really white and I
got really long dreadlocks and I'm wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: an irie genetics t-shirt and or hoodie and
I got a backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's next for the garden of Weeden
you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean like the gym after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, 2015.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spencer just said focus on growing and get
back to the basics and really work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, particularly lately been working on
our veg, just getting our veg absolutely
[SPEAKER_09]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just making sure all of our stuff is
top of the line, getting all of our
[SPEAKER_09]: equipment in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you new growers, did you hear what
Maddie just said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't pay enough attention to
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scolding any of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying a lot of people don't pay
enough attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not you specifically, not you,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't pay enough attention to
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, you could pay more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that veg room as much as you love the
flower room because that's where it all
[SPEAKER_01]: starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy children make healthy adults.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't expect your flower plants to be
amazing when you have a shitty veg.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes even us, we sometimes start
to get so caught up in our flower room
[SPEAKER_09]: that, like I said, our veg started falling
behind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to work on just making sure
all of our garden is in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: In check.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a nice team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you guys can handle shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, we got to do something.
Squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squat stands up and it happens,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fucking awesome to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a big Mike and he's our other part
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to big Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me big Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9 1 9 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of our good homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soraka Nana's bodyguard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come be on the podcast whenever
you want, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to give you big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike isn't into the giant dab thing like
we are over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Glob squad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glob squad.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't heard from me in a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have your new phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my excuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't cause I'm texting the
old phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently I didn't know you had a new
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder who I'm texting because they
shouldn't get those messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got anything left for the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going like 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do that part?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go find that on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got to save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer's thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think too hard, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have just put the seeds that I
germinated of the lemon Jeffrey times
[SPEAKER_09]: cross.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate when I say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have that conversation?
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate when I say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lemon J.
[SPEAKER_07]: King Kim.
[SPEAKER_07]: KCGS.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you guys are, when we're talking,
this is just random side talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about strains,
a lot of times people, and I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid it also, but so many people said it
that I got sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will say the fucking the
lemon Jeff times the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to say crossed to, but so what
do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me that it's at I grow culture,
which I wish I could change that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show name is different and I don't
want to lose all my Twitter followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make a new one and then add the link
to that one in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just double click.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Twitter, but tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how should we say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, what does that X mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's not math.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, like when I just said it,
it's a two times two would make the four,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if we, if you, if two bone two,
it would have four was what would come
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so still though, I just don't,
I mean, it technically could be right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me personally, I just think when it comes
out of my mouth, it just does not sound
[SPEAKER_09]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're not doing math.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's start something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come up with something,
I'll give you the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can think of something,
can I get like phone a friend or
[SPEAKER_09]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a dab alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how long you get to think it
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to get this dab of live resin for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I'm going to have you come on the
show until the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't afford that money for that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to, that's why I was cutting
her off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it over her.
[SPEAKER_07]: We said that that one was cool,
but just to not, we're not going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: all, it doesn't beat times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't think of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that when I talk like it,
the cannabis cup to people, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be offended.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people might like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And F is for Phenyl for a generational.
Label.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Maddie, I'll let you take the
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you try again.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to let her.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This chick takes big dabs, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie takes bigger dabs than you,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the garden, we didn't get weeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you're blowing out a fat dab and
staring off into the sky, what's the new
[SPEAKER_01]: word?
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody else can help.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't think of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the one protesting, you should
find a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to pause and let you take a
drink and cope with life for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I think about it?
[SPEAKER_09]: In the next podcast, we can come back with
something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, do you guys want to be on episode
number 50?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to get you two and Adam and
Jesse and Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can fit that many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let me know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go buy some mics and then return them
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the shit your black friends will
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I want to give you guys a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were on time as fuck and that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's only because I dragged him out of
the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know your house is that close to Amy's
Donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Amy's Donuts on the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Amy's Donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a stomach ache and a toothache both
from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this nigga Michael May, same man with
wild rice.
[SPEAKER_07]: He tried to tell me that wild rice ain't
rice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, bro, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: They call it wild rice.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of carrots he made?
[SPEAKER_09]: Glazed carrots with lemon and some
portobello mushrooms sauteed with spinach.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spencer's reply when it all got sat down
was, this is some white people shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I bet you ate it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate the salmon, the rice and then the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I got us here on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is if I'm going to
double up if I play the Garden of Weedon
[SPEAKER_01]: song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have some other shit
playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to play two songs at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm glad I checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm learning, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't going to double up on two songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been awkward sounding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, fucked everyone's heads all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to start wrapping
up this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go, I do want to say a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I want to thank you guys for
coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem happened to be the first woman
on the show at your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Spence is looking at the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Lemon Jeffery over there in
the jar that I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Platinum OG, some Girl's Got
Cookie, some Grateful Dog and some Lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a peek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell what it is from that angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Grateful Dog, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cracking nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk while he does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me remind you guys of a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't changed the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get sued by that other
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could use a new logo,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to sue you, dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's my fault that weed's about to
fall out there, but it's so sticky it
[SPEAKER_01]: won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I stole somebody's name on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it, but they got all
popular and now they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could use a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep asking for a new song.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep playing that song from
the Mystic Roots Band and other Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band songs because they said I could
and they're free and I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cancelling the Instagram for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be an I Grow Culture podcast
Instagram, but the iRegenetics one will
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to leave it up for a week or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it up so you can go steal all
the pictures or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just start posting those pictures to
the iRegenetics Instagram and have one
[SPEAKER_01]: feed instead of having two feeds I'm
trying to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds like a bunch of
bitching, but it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably cancel the YouTube for the
podcast also and just keep the feed and
[SPEAKER_01]: start doing something with the iRegenetics
YouTube or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so much goddamn media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep up and I want to focus on
doing a good podcast is really what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to email me, you can use
iGrowCulture at Hotmail.com or
[SPEAKER_01]: GrowFromYourHeart at Hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 50 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Spence will make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Maddie will make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have Jesse, hopefully, trying to get
Mike, trying to get Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are invited if you're listening,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, Adam, Mike, Maddie, Spence,
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might fill this little space we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to fucking go.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be hotboxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So episode 50 will be a small celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse teased that he would have some
prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have at least an iRegenetics
t-shirt or three to give away,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a hat pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's got any prizes or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got something to throw in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some Garden of Weed prizes coming
on episode 50, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll leave it like that, random prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I'm doing too until I
run downstairs and check the little box
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've been... I've been just throwing
shit into a pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to dedicate too much,
but when episode 50 comes, Jesse promised
[SPEAKER_01]: some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up, Jesse, if you're listening,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 50 is in like a week and a half if
you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I want you to message me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you learned on the
podcast because we want to talk about that
[SPEAKER_01]: on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recap for you, like we did the year in
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to know what you learned
from the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know who your favorite guests
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just listed them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking Spencer, Jesse,
Mike, Adam, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else has been on the show lately?
Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint's an awesome guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean, dude, fucking... I think Sean got
the most listens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean definitely got the most listens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to come beyond episode 50,
you can, bro, but it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd kind of rather reserve your knowledge
for when it's just you and I face to face
[SPEAKER_01]: because you fucking school me and it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, if there's somebody around here
you'd like to have on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to reach out to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have something you want me to ask
other people and you have some ideas,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're like, get this person on,
back that up with a like and ask them
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll do that because that'll help me
out.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn off your mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, nobody can hear you
now, so go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing black folk business over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So send me some input.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it's igrowculturehotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could tweet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's igrowculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might make a new one since Spence had
that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a new Twitter page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's something that's grown
from your heart somewhere else that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fucking try to sue me for that
too, but it's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just, we'll stand up for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that on my website for a long
time, so I think I own that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of our favorites.
[SPEAKER_09]: The flavor on it's ridiculous.

our boy Sloppy.

so we might just ramble for a second.

this live resin and then we'll turn the
[SPEAKER_01]: mics down and let the song kick on in the
Garden Weed and Getting Weeded.
