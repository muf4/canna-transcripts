[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 145 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_02]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_02]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this episode is packed with
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna do an episode about an email I
got about making feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting phenotypes for seeds and seed
breeding and feminized seed making.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was right up my alley,
so I took a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a great episode, in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get that far, let's talk
about the secret sesh, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The secret sesh was just a few days ago,
and in my opinion, this was the best
[SPEAKER_02]: secret sesh we've done in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the secret sesh on 421,
the day after 420, that was pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: fantastic, but that was the day after 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of really cool people in
town that wouldn't normally be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of extra hype because of the
420 weekend, a lot of extra momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really helped us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little over-hyped and too big for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a smaller, more intimate event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without all the hustle and bustle,
this was my favorite secret sesh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were plenty of people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place was packed, but it was a little
more intimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was more room to dab, more room to
chill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little quieter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go get some quiet space and talk
to some people if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So huge shout-out to the Grimy Gatsby for
throwing a stellar event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out to Miles for putting it
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out to everybody who
participated in this secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go down a little bit of a list
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Terps from Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big huge shout-out to my buddy Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett, Mary's motivation on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude showed up with a pocket full of
Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody said something.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Bobo said something to Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett goes, so you want some Terps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course Bobo was like, well of course I
want some Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: He threw him a canister filled with little
Terp containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobo's eyes lit up like a child at
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happened to have a bunch of packs
of seeds in my pocket that I was gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: give to some friends to grow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I saw that beautiful gift given
right there, I decided to return some
[SPEAKER_02]: karma and I passed some seeds Brett's way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett's got some iry, genetic seeds in his
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be growing those out before too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about those on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big huge shout-out to the Terpy boy
Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett hooks it up with the Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just got us dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some super good flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody at the event had good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to our friends at the Terp
Suite.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those kids always bring the flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good to see Diamond Dave at the
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave, I don't know if you listened to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good to shake your hand and see
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't seen you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just seemed like we weren't getting along
on Facebook for some reason, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good to shake your hand and
fucking put that behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome back to the crew, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out to Lindsey and Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: For letting me kind of tag along to be
their third wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had fun hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get Lindsey on another episode
because I've got something I want to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to her about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll talk about sending stickers
to all you people that we owe stickers to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not forget, Mike and Lindsey and I
talked about it via text message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we owe you guys some stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred, your stickers are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other people, you got stickers
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that participated in the mullet
challenge, you do have stickers coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not forget about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that hit up hashtag,
I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got stickers coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody forgot about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just dabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're blazed and confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing what we can to keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back on track here, shout-out to Adam
Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Hill comes all the way from
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He flies in from Burbank all the way to
Colorado here to host The Secret Sesh with
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout-out to my boy, Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know about Adam Hill,
make sure you follow him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Adam Bluntz, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always has to change his social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always shut down his social media and
he has to restart new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Search Adam Hill on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Adam Bluntz on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the hostess with the mostess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, big shout-out to my buddy,
Giddy Up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen Giddy Up in a while and
Giddy Up was at The Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocking a mohawk, building a stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great dude, that Giddy Up guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys support Emotech.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude just moved to Hollywood,
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's young and rich and lives in Cali now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck with that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope things go well for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big huge shout-out to my buddy,
Jason Margulies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I missed your lovely lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been good to see her and
give her a high five and a half hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those one-armed hugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been good to see her,
but it was good seeing you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time, bring the lady with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll all hang out and take some terpy
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all the shout-outs I've got
for The Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I turned down edibles this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not eat any edibles at The Secret
Sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to TNT Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me some 200-milligram bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he handed me bacon wrapped in
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, hmm, okay then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walked away and acted like I was
gonna eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, I gave that to our buddy,
Bobo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the edibles I was given that night,
I passed them right over to Bobo.
[SPEAKER_02]: At The Sesh, people just walk by you and
hand you edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, here, you need some edibles,
bro, and I will take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if I'm not on the edible zone
that night, I just pass them on to
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobo got all of my eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was lit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm afraid, you guys, I ate a bunch of
edibles at The Last Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate, I don't even know, a lot of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of THC in my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna guess somewhere between 800 and
1,500 milligrams of THC in my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was challenged.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having a rough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our friends at TNT Extracts gave
me a 1,000-milligram edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ate it for breakfast the next day on
my way to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time I got to work,
it felt like I had wrapped a vice around
[SPEAKER_02]: my brain and I was trying to function on
half speed all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been afraid of edibles since then,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't eaten any.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'll do it for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably go see fish and eat a couple
hundred milligrams of the fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be what has to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, let's get to the
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point of this podcast, I received an
email from a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me open up this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it saved right here on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude signed his name as Justin Noob
trying to learn, and then he called
[SPEAKER_02]: himself Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Noob trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: This question was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked a lot of great questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really sparked a great podcast,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me read the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I want to say thank you for the
Kick-Ass podcast and that you have taught
[SPEAKER_02]: me so much in these weekly sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make my Monday morning commute
tolerable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's why I put them out Monday
morning, so your week doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: start with a shitty Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start off with some Kick-Ass podcast
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for checking it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, your question is not stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so excited when I read this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, I know a lot about this,
and I'm going to get to ramble on for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to continue with email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says,
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I encourage everybody,
every time you grow a seed, every time it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets big enough to take a clone,
you take a clone off of it before you
[SPEAKER_02]: flower it because you don't know if that
seed is going to bear the most amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis you have ever smoked in your
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have a clone of it,
you might try to kick yourself in the ass,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're going to be kind of mad about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heartbreaking when you don't get a
cut of this super amazing herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew some, excuse me for the throat
clearing, of course, that's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew some Holy Grail Kush from DNA
Genetics, and it was honestly superb
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get your hands on some Holy
Grail Kush seeds, I recommend that from
[SPEAKER_02]: another breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even my brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a Reserva Pravada project by
now, but Holy Grail Kush, get the real
[SPEAKER_02]: deal, the old school shit from DNA
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not get, the phenotype I selected
would not make clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would not root for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put them in rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shriveled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put them in a cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got funky and fell apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not get that shit to clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never get to taste that flavor again.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Pops is an old guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says that was one of the top five best
pots he's ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pops is an old dude and hard to
impress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Holy Grail Kush was some special
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not get it to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite strains ever was the
P91, and there were some serious raids of
[SPEAKER_02]: large grow facilities, and the P91,
rumor has it, was lost in that raid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody claims to have it, but I really
don't know if that is what they have got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can claim to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about something else you
said in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that the strains are named for a
special phenotypically expressed trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's why the sour diesel is called
sour diesel, because it smells like diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they tried to name the Girl Scout
cookies that, because they wanted us to
[SPEAKER_02]: think that it tastes like Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit, they call it the thin
mint cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get the thin mint, they taste the
thin mint cookies and the thin mint cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be close.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that part is totally accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's what I really liked getting
into in this part of the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, if the traits are passed from
mother to clone, would it be likely that
[SPEAKER_02]: the same traits would be present in nearly
100% of the seeds if you were to make
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds from this plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: You would hope so because of logic,
but that is not accurate, and I took a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of notes, and I'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to take a break here in a
second, take a drink, but let me keep
[SPEAKER_02]: reading the email, and then I'll take a
drink, take a quick break, just because
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys don't want to hear me clear my
throat a thousand more times.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email goes on to say, my logic may be
way off on this, as I am not a botanist or
[SPEAKER_02]: geneticist, but if it does play out like
this, then why don't the seed companies
[SPEAKER_02]: grow out several plants to find that rare
phenotype, and then make feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: from that plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any knowledge you can drop will be greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, bro, from Justin Noob trying to
learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he signs it, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: Noob, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna press pause for just a second
here, take a drink, and then I'll be right
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a big fresh drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be better for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna take a dab and fuck it all up
again, but I'm better for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get back to this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part that got my attention here at the
end said, if the traits are passed from
[SPEAKER_02]: mother to clone, would it be likely that
the same traits would be present in nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% of the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a clone, you're taking a cutting from
an existing plant, and that plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: making a root, of course, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're getting a clone,
so all the traits are passed because there
[SPEAKER_02]: was no opportunity for any other
chromosomes or genetics or traits to be
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced into that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not gonna pull DNA out of the
air to change the traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, that one will be exactly like the
mother that it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we're working with seeds,
we have the opportunity for variation
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're using pollen that has
chromosomes from the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not only getting parents,
not only getting chromosomes from that
[SPEAKER_02]: selected phenotype, but you're getting
chromosomes from whatever that plant is a
[SPEAKER_02]: cross of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that I wanna mention,
and we do search for those selected
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm making Arise F2s,
which means I made an Arise strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I took Daybreaker as the male,
and I put Daybreaker pollen on a Golden
[SPEAKER_02]: Goat female, and I took those seeds,
and what came out of that, I named that
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've found a beautiful male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a studly male.
[SPEAKER_02]: He produces the structure I want,
the aroma I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: This male plant is a stud, so I've got
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've got, I think right now I've
got three or four gorgeous Arise females
[SPEAKER_02]: that I need to pick one of those because I
wanna take that Arise male and I wanna put
[SPEAKER_02]: that pollen on that Arise female and make
Arise F2s, and I'm doing that by selecting
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect phenotype of the perfect male
and the perfect female to bring out the
[SPEAKER_02]: traits that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I could screw that all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could bring out a bunch of recessive
traits, and it could be a total disaster,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll have to go back and find a
different male and female and do it all
[SPEAKER_02]: over again, but that's why I grow out a
bunch of them myself before I try to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: them or give them away to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make sure to grow probably 100 of those
by myself before anybody else will even
[SPEAKER_02]: see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do look for those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find those perfect phenotypes,
and sometimes a cross will be made that
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't intended to smell like something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that Tangi, I don't think
that the guy that made Tangi, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: was Crockett.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Crockett was like,
I wanna make Tangi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Tangi should be Cali-O and this,
whatever the hell he used, I forgot,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this orange plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he was like, I wanna make
Tangi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he crossed some shit and it came
out and tastes like tangerines,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's like, that's it, Tangi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how that came.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody was like,
I wanna make a strain that tastes like
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was actually named because of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they selected that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about something else you
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we use those selected
phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I'm gonna make Femini seeds
from that selected phenotype, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: treat, so I'm gonna take two clones of the
same plant, the selected phenotype that
[SPEAKER_02]: has the traits that we like, the one that,
so we'll say Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made Femini seeds of Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown a bunch of my own Grateful Dog
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the one that is stellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take two clones of that, I reverse
one, and I put that reversed pollen onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the female Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I make Grateful Dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds
look like Chem Dog, and sometimes those
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dog seeds look a little bit more
like San Fernando Valley OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of them look very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty much like the Grateful Dog
clone that I reversed and started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll get a little bit of
variation that's a little closer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem, but more OG, and then a little more
OG, but closer to the Chem, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see blends of the traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like making kids,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your sister might look a little
different from you, but you could
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely tell you're from the same gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gonna vary a little bit more
from, so you're gonna see traits of
[SPEAKER_02]: grandma is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna see traits of grandpa is what
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you might see
great-grandparent traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me refer back to my notes here to
keep myself on topic, because I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: way, way off of what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do search for those phenotypes,
and that's how we make our F2s,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we do reverse those to make our
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I breed with my second and third
generations from those selected,
[SPEAKER_02]: I make my second and third generations
from those selected plants, and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about picking one female and one
female, or one male and one female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else I also do, I will take
multiple females of the same strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: one male of that strain, and hit three or
four different females with that male
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, and that way I've got,
I can see the variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that this girl produces more
resinous offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that this girl produces tall and
lanky offspring, so I don't wanna breed to
[SPEAKER_02]: that one again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that this one over here produces
really lanky plants that stink really well
[SPEAKER_02]: but don't make a lot of resin,
so maybe I don't wanna breed to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go and hit multiple females,
so that way I can find the best breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that I can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll also hit different females of
different strains in that room with that
[SPEAKER_02]: male, so I'll put four females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I do this Arise F2, it's about to
happen pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably put two, maybe three females
of Arise in there, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'm gonna probably put seven or
eight, maybe nine or 10 females of other
[SPEAKER_02]: strains in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a Grateful Dog in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna put a Golden Goat in there to
take it backwards a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some other stuff that's gonna go
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some crosses I made that'll go in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm gonna hit all of those with
pollen, and then we'll see what comes of
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we'll see what comes of all of
that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a phenotype, phenotypical expression,
pheno, not phenome, just to make you sound
[SPEAKER_02]: cooler in your circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're making seeds and those
seeds do come out, of course, variation is
[SPEAKER_02]: natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't control it completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make something that I did
that I didn't even realize I was kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing something out of the norm,
I made feminized seeds and then I found my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite phenotype out of that batch of
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I hit that feminized plant with
the original pollen that I made feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the progeny from that was super
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tried to reverse one of those
plants and I could not get it to reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not make the plant herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not change the sex of that plant
to make more feminized seeds with that
[SPEAKER_02]: generation of that progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was super impressed with the
stability of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant is still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been named GD77.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people ask me about my naming
schemes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very random.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dog was GD.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1977 is one of my favorite years of the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So GD77, it's the Grateful Dead 77 pheno.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the mother room right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably had that one for,
I don't even know how long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it for a super long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time, eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say eight years I've had that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variation is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're making seeds, I like
variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want every seed to grow out just
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the picture on the package
because everyone's got that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a little bit of variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that the grower down the street
that bought those seeds doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype that I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that there might be something
better in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you can always keep growing
more seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I love seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find something better than what
you've already got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when somebody loses a plant or
if something doesn't root when you try to
[SPEAKER_02]: clone it, I always look at the bright
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I get to grow more seeds
because seeds are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds have vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find new shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every strain that you're smoking,
every clone that you've ever grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: that came from a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, it had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: The variation, of course, you could
stabilize that just by breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make F2s, make F3s.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you get to F5, those seeds
will be super stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start making seeds that produce
almost clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get to the F6 generation,
probably 90% of the seeds that you plant
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to look just like the picture on
the package if the breeder did it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I'm going to take a
dab and a drink and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: another email to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I do that, I want to give a big
shout out to our buddy The Noob that sent
[SPEAKER_02]: us this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like talking about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like talking about making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some of my favorite shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more questions about that,
send them to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will read your emails on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I need a drink and a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Play some reggae music and you can hang
out for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'll see you in the next
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I am back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a drink, did not take some dabs this
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have a voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my throat is going to hold up for
at least a couple more emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to another email.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one says, Rasta J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently discovered my latest batch of
girls are not as innocent as I would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they are flat ass full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question for you is if there are any
dead giveaways to determine if they were
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated or simply hermed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a sneaky mail get by me until
about week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had him labeled wrong and stuck him in
the flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping this is the case and not a herm
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he continues to give me reasons why
his plants may have hermed and duty out of
[SPEAKER_02]: mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a boy in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That mail at three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He busted a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pollinated your girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what that mail was?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my question now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what that mail plant was,
you may have accidentally just bred some
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep those seeds, grow them out,
see what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that mail
dropped pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only takes about 14 days for some of
those studlier males to just start blowing
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had him in there until about
week three, I'm pretty sure that's who hit
[SPEAKER_02]: those girls with pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the list of things you mentioned that
may be reasons why those plants hermed,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does not look likely to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recent switch of lighting that would
not do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The slight foxtailing you mentioned,
that's because they got too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that made them herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a dude in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, when you have mail, if you were
growing from seed or if you have a mail
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, I have mails in my stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of big fat mail arise
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Solomon just chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kicking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're growing from seed and you
got boy plants, those boy plants will drop
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually got a strawberry tangy
banana mail plant in a very small pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see mail flower clusters forming
on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't get that out of there in the
next 10 days, he will drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That pollen will come from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're growing from seed,
keep an eye on those pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't want seeded plants,
if you don't want pollen, don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get those mails out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude's a perfect example of why you
don't want to have mails in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got seeds now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That brings me to something I've wanted to
say for a little while and haven't had the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running a garden and there's
some shit that needs to be done,
[SPEAKER_02]: do it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wait?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your love.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing for commercial,
if you're growing for medicinal,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're growing just for love,
do that shit today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants are alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your dog was hungry and your dog needed
water, you wouldn't make the dog wait till
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you make the plants wait?
[SPEAKER_02]: Love those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to care for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that needs to be done in the
groom.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that bulb is dirty or if that bulb is
dead, that lens is dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that ducting is funky, don't do that
shit tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that shit today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a lazy bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That garden, that crop is only going to be
in flower for 63 days, 56, 63,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 70 days if you're going hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not make every day count?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there and do that shit right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some love into those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll quit bitching at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I kind of got on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just love your plants, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You claim to love your garden,
go love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another message I want to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember a few episodes ago, we had a
listener send an email asking about
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations for dispensaries in Denver
and I took a screenshot of his latest
[SPEAKER_02]: message.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me this message on Instagram and
it says, Rasta Jeff wanted to thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: for reading my email on your podcast and
for recommending Natty Rems.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I loved our trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to let you know that Stitcher has
all of your episodes starting at episode
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 all the way to the current episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep those beautiful Instagram images
coming from our friend Fats.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great message to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm glad you enjoyed Natty Rems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad Colorado was super kind to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you and your wife had a
great trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also glad to hear that all of the
episodes starting at episode 40 are on
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that everybody can listen all
the way back to episode 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably 44-ish by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 45 by the time this comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means they're going to keep 100
episodes on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 100 episodes of this podcast
available on Stitcher, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go listen to 100 episodes
of the show, I encourage you to go back
[SPEAKER_02]: and listen to old episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorites, I think, is the
scheduling your perpetual grow episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That episode, that should have been a
million-dollar book idea, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to that one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't heard that one,
go listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's number 72.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be a responsible podcast host
and press pause and go make sure what
[SPEAKER_02]: number that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I found the information I
wanted to find, but I want to let you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: know something funny that I just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy John Hunt gave me a pencil
dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is made out of green stardust glass,
and it's got some colored tips and a
[SPEAKER_02]: colored eraser end, or a colored tip where
the pencil end would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colored tip or the eraser end would
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made out of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meant to be used as a dabber,
and my high ass just picked it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to write a fucking note on my
notepad with the dabber pencil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Cannabis and THC for that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, the episode I was actually
referring to is number 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out episode number 73.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's scheduling your perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that episode should have been
a million-dollar episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're going through it, check out
number 76 about phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you want to learn about Outdoor,
our friend Jesse comes by episode number
73.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 79, but definitely go back and
check out 73, and number 55 is one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're new to the podcast, make sure
you check out 55.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've thought about going back
and releasing some of the older episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: on like a Thursday, like a midweek
episode, so maybe once some of those older
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes fall out of the feed,
once I put so many episodes in that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like 50 more that I can repost,
I'll go back and put those up on a
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday or something so that they're
still in the feed and you guys can listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to them, because there are some great
episodes that need to stay up for a little
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get the show back on
track, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to our friend Fats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, next time you're in Colorado,
give me a heads up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get together, we'll smoke some
turps, we'll take some selfies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a good old time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you want to send me a message
or an email, or if you want to hit me up
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow, email me,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read your message on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to follow me on Instagram,
it's at irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to follow me on Facebook,
just search for the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an upcoming episode, my buddy Sammy
sent me an email asking about easy
[SPEAKER_02]: cloners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will also talk about how to set your
email to the appropriate temp for your
[SPEAKER_02]: liking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody sent me a question about my dream
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of talk about that on an
upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I also have an episode, another
question from a listener.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an episode about identifying
issues in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in a future episode, I will talk
about how to treat and prevent most of
[SPEAKER_02]: those issues and or problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys have some content that you
would like me to talk about, I encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: you to send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the episodes lately have come from
listener questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast, this comes from my heart,
but this podcast is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you give me some content,
I would love to read your stuff on the
[SPEAKER_02]: air, get you guys going, get you growing,
help you guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something that you like to
say and you're not in all that social
[SPEAKER_02]: media stuff, I'll introduce email me,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can remain anonymous and won't say
your name on the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep you safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to get you in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys make sure you check out the
podcast on iTunes and Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that most of the episodes are
available on iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is all I have got for you
this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a big shout out to my Ninja
Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check me out in seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need your tenderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't resist you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl, you're all I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always missing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need your tenderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't resist you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need your tenderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't resist you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it for the Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it for the Terps.
Do it for Terps.
