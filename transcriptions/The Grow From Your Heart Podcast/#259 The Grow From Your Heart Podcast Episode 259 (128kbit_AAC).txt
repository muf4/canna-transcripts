[SPEAKER_07]: my friend, Ms. Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing today, honey?
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I introduced you right as you were
about to take a drink, but it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: rhythm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was feeling the flow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting to my left here is our good
friend, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up with you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hanging out, taking some dabs,
doing a podcast, loving life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious, delicious hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to get the echo out of this show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I just fixed the echo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about the echo there, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I realized it was happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just could not figure out where the fuck
it was going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd it come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Echo's been solved.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did we talk about first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm proud to announce that this
podcast is now available on tokeradio.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the show airs on Wednesdays at 1 p
.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

[SPEAKER_07]: We took a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we shout out to Elevate?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure we did that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, what else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a secret if we talk about it here?
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we just can't talk about the
location, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a secret.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Secret Sash, we would like you to join
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, you're going to come to the Secret
Sash, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: White Mike might make an appearance.
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't make it to a lot of cannabis
events because he's busy at City Council
[SPEAKER_07]: fighting for the rights of Pueblo
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or lately, I'm just home with the kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of podcast listeners are
going to have to deal with this one for a
[SPEAKER_07]: second.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the kid, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had another checkup today and all
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two seconds about the kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys could deal with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love for the kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the wife, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything good at home?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the car running good?
[SPEAKER_07]: This just got fucking weird real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Sash, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: May 19th, we hope you will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Sash, underscore CO on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the information on how to get
tickets, how to get VIP tickets,
[SPEAKER_07]: regular tickets.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come party with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come glob out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the best shatter, some of the best
live resins, some of the best wax,
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the best THC distillate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not some of the best people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did meet one dude there that I wish I
would have never met.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: This always wanted every party.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made that part out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of cannabis events in
Colorado and I don't want to go to a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of them, but this one's high on my list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last one was really sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to hang out with you all night,
actually, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It worked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can retell the story that you told
Mike about the dab I took.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Mary's motivation on
Instagram, Brent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to meet him at a secret session.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had some of this THC distillate and
Jeff is a wook and always takes such big
[SPEAKER_09]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: He took a nice chunk glob of this THC
distillate and you just watched his whole
[SPEAKER_09]: face change and that was it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was super stoned.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong, Jeff was still
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff was still smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a sesh.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not going to look like a wimp,
but you could just see all over his face
[SPEAKER_09]: that that dab changed his level for the
whole night and that was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of remember that dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember being like, yeah, give me a
fatty glob, dude, because I love some
[SPEAKER_07]: distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can pull the fattest, so we should try
to describe what distillate is.
[SPEAKER_07]: They take CO2 and a hash maker will take
CO2 hash, hash that's made with CO2,
[SPEAKER_07]: oftentimes it's kind of black and goopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it comes out kind of gold,
but then they do what I think is fractal
[SPEAKER_07]: distillation is what I think it's called
and it could be done with steam.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure how a lot of the companies do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the companies have their own
proprietary method, but they pretty much
[SPEAKER_07]: distill this product and they give you
pure THC with terpenes put back in or some
[SPEAKER_07]: of the companies actually put in terpenes
that are purchased from other products
[SPEAKER_07]: that are derived from other products.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what this guy had was just pure
cannabis with cannabis terpenes in it,
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's all pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just super pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's THC and terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can take the biggest freaking dabs
and you don't choke.
[SPEAKER_07]: My lungs felt like they got a little smoke
in them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh yeah, my lungs got some
smoke and I blew it out and there was a
[SPEAKER_07]: cloud.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yeah, I'm not going to
cough, but I could definitely feel,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, you could feel the face go a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bounce from white to red to white to red.
[SPEAKER_09]: The usual Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love those dads.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that raw THC distillate was just out
of this world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, he gifted Chris and I that and
the added terpenes one and Chris can't
[SPEAKER_09]: remember which terpene was added to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a good week.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a really good week.
[SPEAKER_07]: This morning dab was special.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike brought over some strawberry banana
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to dab that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds super interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some live resin I picked up the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that from the place of employment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I picked that up at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Botanico product though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Botanico.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they make some tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the new Terpex packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love their new packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Sash May 19th.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we finished that part up,
but I take dab to Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you come take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to talk about a couple of
things here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike and I and Lindsay, Mike and I have
lived here for a long ass time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen this cannabis industry change.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thought all the raids and all the
cannabis shit has gone away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay's been here for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: She hasn't seen any cannabis trouble in
the time that she's been here.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the past, how many weeks,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many raids?
[SPEAKER_07]: 18 now.
[SPEAKER_07]: 18 raids in seven weeks in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not like stores or licensed
facilities or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're private grows that are way over
their legal plant count.
[SPEAKER_07]: Way over their legal plant count.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw them pulling a whole bunch of plants
out of one guy's garage on the news the
[SPEAKER_03]: other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number 18 only had like 50 plants,
but a couple of them before that were in
[SPEAKER_03]: the several hundred or like 1200,
1500.
[SPEAKER_07]: I read somewhere that a lot of these grows
are connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another set of raids up in
Springs that this 18 doesn't count,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're all connected in like El Paso
and Denver County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our laws didn't change the black market
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's still a bunch of black
market growers that are sitting around all
[SPEAKER_03]: winter going, where's a place where I
think I can hide and no one will notice me
[SPEAKER_03]: growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently like if you're sitting in
Florida all winter thinking that the
[SPEAKER_03]: answer is Colorado, cause there's a
shitload of people from Florida getting
[SPEAKER_03]: busted growing a shitload of plants here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the raids happen to people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They happen to be people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So where are you from over there,
Ms. Lindsay, Mr. Traveling Stoner?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was born in Jersey.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I'll claim that today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't ever claim that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I never tell people I'm from Jersey.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will claim Florida over Jersey any day,
but not in those conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made a couple of friends that are
recent arrivals in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like over the last year and a half or so
from Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've told all of them like,
yo, if you're growing weed, make sure your
[SPEAKER_03]: plant count is spot the fuck on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's only a matter of time before
a sheriff knocks on your door and is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you're from Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see your basement?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I see your basement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it that easy for them to just knock?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a couple of things that work
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all the bus are in the same area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you ask me, cause all the press
stories all say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A citizen complaint was called in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sheriffs went out to check,
confirmed the suspicion that there was
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana being grown there, checked the
plant counts, found a shitload of plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and no paperwork and arrested the recent
arrival from Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's like 18 grows and like 15 of
them match that exact layout.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's the anti-pop people
that have that, that are working on that
[SPEAKER_03]: ballot initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them live out in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just driving around
looking at new houses or looking at houses
[SPEAKER_03]: for vents and the stink of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just calling on everything
they find.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not reporting on all of the grows
that are perfectly legal where they knock
[SPEAKER_03]: on the door and the dude's like,
I totally grow marijuana here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hundred percent legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have blank number of plants and X number
of paperwork sheets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's everything to confirm what I'm
legally allowed to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come take a look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can confirm it's all correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just turn around and leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a small grow isn't a big deal right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, having a legal grow isn't an issue at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not messing with the businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that happens in a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the home grows that are way out
of compliance with our law.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they're using electricity
bills to find?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just like, yup.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say they're looking at that
and they have a lot of angles,
[SPEAKER_09]: but at the end of the day, what it comes
down to is that if you come out here,
[SPEAKER_09]: please do it legally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have listened to so many podcasts of you
to sit here and say, do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop, you know, stop trying to,
you're making our community look bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making us look like we're trying to
break the laws and trying to get away with
[SPEAKER_09]: this.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us in the community are trying to,
I have not started growing yet since I
[SPEAKER_09]: have come out here because my paperwork is
not in order yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to be growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to have a whole, you know,
two rooms going, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_09]: happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I need to get my paperwork in line
first and I can grow six legally as a
[SPEAKER_09]: Colorado resident.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't be a hypocrite.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there was a time where I was moving
and shaking and doing shit that should not
[SPEAKER_07]: be spoken of on a podcast, but we've told
some hypothetical stories of my past.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're, if you are hustling on the
black market, doing your thing,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not a hater.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to do your thing, do what you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But eventually there's going to come a
time when you, when you got to start
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking about shifting to the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a difference between making money
to survive and being greedy and having
[SPEAKER_09]: these huge grows that these people are
getting busted for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's these huge commercial grows in
houses for no reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you're all going to go and sell that
in another, you know, like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you really think about it, it's just so
stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is why they were in the national
parks 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they hide anywhere they think they can
hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, and they're trying to hide in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, they don't realize how well
publicized the rules have been here
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're not publicized anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like New Mexico, Florida, Kansas,
none of these places care about what the
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning rules are for the shops or what the
home grow rules are in each city and
[SPEAKER_03]: county.
[SPEAKER_03]: So none of that shit makes the paper just
as weeds legal and they're allowed to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: How strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they think, Oh, I can move to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can throw down the 18 grand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've managed to save up on grow equipment,
rent a house, pull a crop or two,
[SPEAKER_03]: drive it all back to Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bam, I've got 400 grand and they just
don't see how insane that plan is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the grow store is going to sell you
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, when you plug it all in,
you're going to have to have the power
[SPEAKER_03]: company come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time the power company is done
upgrading you, all your neighbors want to
[SPEAKER_03]: know what the fuck you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it smells like weed,
which is going to be about, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, eight weeks later, um, one of them
was going to call the sheriff and go,
[SPEAKER_03]: would you knock on this buck store?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He had some guy building some shit there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did new electricity, watched him
carrying a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it reeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure he's got an illegal
operation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is all assuming you don't have a
landlord that's going to be checking on
[SPEAKER_09]: everything and all of that jazz as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of these guys were like,
just showed up, rented a house and went to
[SPEAKER_03]: bought some plywood and started ply
boarding over exterior windows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like one dude had a pit bull.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chained to a window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like these are idiots in the most
extreme sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because I mean, if you think about it,
you could move here, grow, even your six
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, just being here as an adult limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were dumb enough to take the
risk to move that back to Florida,
[SPEAKER_03]: just that smaller harvest, you could still
make a fair living.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it wouldn't be extravagant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't be rolling back and forth in
a brand new Escalade.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you could make enough to pay
your rent and pay your bills, but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do hundreds of plants because
they're stupid and greedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they think no one's going to notice
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, that's just so insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you do get it harvested and dried
and cured, you're going to get pulled the
[SPEAKER_07]: fuck over.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you cross into Kansas,
a couple of them got busted halfway to
[SPEAKER_03]: where they were headed because they just,
the turn signal violation, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds of weed in the car smells like
hundreds of pounds of weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, y'all know how bad your quarter ounce
snakes on the way home from picking it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like magnify that by a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because you guys aren't being smart
and vacuum sealing it and like doing it
[SPEAKER_09]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just putting it in trash bags and
throwing it in the back and praying to God
[SPEAKER_09]: you'll make it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trash bags is the gangster way to carry
somebody though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you know that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way to get cowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just double bag that shit home.
[SPEAKER_03]: You be fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: My little, my little friend that's not
real tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: He used to give me the trash bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the clear trash bags full.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day that hypothetically
happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: The days of coming up and growing big
ridiculous amounts of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado, maybe come into an end here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're gung ho, you got to be smart
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, be careful you guys, if you're
going to come here from another state and
[SPEAKER_07]: think you're going to set up shop,
read the rules, get, get really familiar
[SPEAKER_07]: with the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two parts of this that piss me off the
most is like, a, now we got to pay to send
[SPEAKER_03]: these fucks to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And B, they're fucking up our reputation
and they're giving a whole bunch of fire
[SPEAKER_03]: to the anti-pop people and they didn't
need to fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, uh, they've lost two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time they spoke up, they got told,
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, they're really, really angry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need fuel for that fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 busts in seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single one of them is out in
Pueblo West basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, you've lived your life for how
long?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo doesn't report shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and all of a sudden we've got 18
successful pot grow tips in seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's some weird shit going on
right now and people didn't see it coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're growing in Pueblo,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your shit cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your plant count in order.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Colorado wide right now,
like gearing up for the election.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a new president coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everywhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're growing everywhere, if you're
growing, get your shit cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now's a good time to think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you, if you're a medical marijuana
grower, uh, if you've got a plant count,
[SPEAKER_07]: go count your fucking plants, go consider
like, go get one under your plant count.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that if some shit goes wrong and you
break off a branch and it looks like an
[SPEAKER_07]: extra plan on accident, uh, go check your
gram weight, uh, get to your perfect gram
[SPEAKER_07]: weight and then roll up a fat joint and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're a fat joint underneath your gram
limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just go get your shit in order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike looked at me like, that's,
that's a really good, I had that thought
[SPEAKER_03]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I've got a nice hash pile going
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, like, I can't,
I can't even take this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I move, technically I'll have to
break the law moving this from house one
[SPEAKER_03]: to house two, because I'm not supposed to
have that much shit out in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over my gram limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, how much, wait, you've got to,
can we talk about your extended plant
[SPEAKER_07]: count and your medical marijuana card?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we talk about that on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but just theoretically just for the
illegal rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause at the same time I was thinking
about needing to go get my card again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of this applies to us too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're not special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've got deadlines to reapply and
dates to follow and card cats to adhere
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to go, I get to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I get my doctor, my MMJ doctor a
shout out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I get to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he, dude, he would fucking line is
long enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike just made a really good, it takes
like four weeks to get into the fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to go may 19th to go renew my
shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you give me his number?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really wanted to make them all feel
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a few blocks from the office.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind giving it to one or two
people, but don't shout it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I was just trying to prove a
point.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bruce needs some business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same one up here down there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you, you catch him on his Springs day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in Springs like four days a week now
and he's in Pueblo one day a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to my MMJ doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: He knows, he knows my conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: He knows me well.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I walk in, he just starts writing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this like the 10th time?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, yup, 10 years in a row,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been a medical marijuana patient for
probably close to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say Mike's thinking back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike's got a better, I have a seven or
eight for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we've had a decade yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did you guys go and get them together
for the first time around similar time?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the same, same year within a year
or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had one before me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was running a shop and he came in as a
patient with one with another patient and
[SPEAKER_07]: we got along.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got along pretty well.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was love at first sight.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was love at first sight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss those days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: That place was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're reminiscing all chatterbox.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: People like hearing insight to our lives.
[SPEAKER_07]: They really do because like guys like Seb,
shout out to Ross De Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't get to sit around and be on a
podcast and take dabs and live the life
[SPEAKER_07]: that we get to live.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got to fucking dodge ostriches.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that fucking thing he said
almost ran over?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it an emu?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever that thing was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seb, what was that thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our buddy Seb posted a video.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was driving in Australia and a giant
long legged bird.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked like an ostrich.
[SPEAKER_09]: An emu?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it could have been.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I thought I guessed,
but it could have been an emu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for now, where could the video
camera while you're driving?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like giant running birds would be easy to
dodge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's got a dash cam of some sort
going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's periscoping, Snapchatting
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't judge the dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He lives in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing with Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is trying to kill you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put the floor down and pay the fuck
attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything in Australia wants to kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I said that, I was like,
I wonder if it's kind of like Russia where
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone has a camera mounted on their
dashboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And an M16?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there it's because the odds that
someone gets out mugs use really high.
[SPEAKER_07]: They use AKs over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my high.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: They like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I want to give a big shout out
to my friends over at Elevate Glass and
[SPEAKER_07]: the lovely ladies and the one gentleman
that run the place over at Elevate Glass
[SPEAKER_07]: and also my good friends at Hemp Higher
Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you guys check out the showroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you tell them Rasta Jeff sent
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a brand new recycler rig here
with the brand new banger on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I filled it just to the perfect level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can, you can really pull so hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get water in your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get a big fat globby dad and I
like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mike, you were talking about some
political stuff is why we've got you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's just the one thing I wanted to
throw in right now is a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_03]: focused on the November election as they
should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay for paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I listened to a podcast the other
night where he was like really mean to the
[SPEAKER_09]: listeners and you're like, damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's primary elections too in
everybody's area and these matter and no
[SPEAKER_03]: one ever turns out for these.
[SPEAKER_03]: The example down here is this November,
we might be voting to ban the recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, before we even get to that vote
possibly happening, there'll be election,
[SPEAKER_03]: election, primary election.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Space the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: A primary election down here where we
elect people like city councilman and
[SPEAKER_03]: county commissioners and the local judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe there'll be a couple of small
local issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get handled like city or county wide.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to run for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing this round, but if two people down
here happen to get elected instead of the
[SPEAKER_03]: two people that currently have this job
getting reelected, retail marijuana could
[SPEAKER_03]: go away anyway, because the number of pro
and anti-marijuana votes would swing that
[SPEAKER_03]: far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just two people getting swapped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot going on politically in
everyone's area that they need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: paying attention to right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now is the time to go find out
if you're registered to vote, go find out
[SPEAKER_03]: how that works in your area in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just mail it to your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do anything,
but check the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it shows up, you fill it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take it to a drop off point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the sticker that says I voted and
you get to be awesome for like the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other places, it's a little harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to go stand in line, but do it,
like figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now's the time to figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's not till November.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's a long time away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of you are like, I just plan
in my outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like after harvest, I'll figure out how to
run it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, that's what a lot of people
think right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the election's not till November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why pay attention?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying, I'm not telling them to
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking they don't want to pay
attention to politics yet because that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit's months and months away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now's the time to get registered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now's the time to start paying attention
to what's going on in your area and start
[SPEAKER_03]: to making sure you've done what you need
to do to actually vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick of the marijuana community just
being a non-existent entity politically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we outnumber Christians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about the number of Christians that
annoy you constantly because they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: shit politically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how powerful that particular
group of people is in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: We outnumber NRA members by five times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the DEA's estimate for how
many people smoke pot in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more pot smokers than gun
toters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't matter at all politically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got no hatred for anybody with a gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I said that condescendingly,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't disrespect anybody that carries a
firearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you think about how much influence
the NRA wields, and then you look up the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual number of NRA members and their
actual operating budget, it's terrifying
[SPEAKER_03]: how a group that small can be that
influential.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were just to get a little bit
organized or at least just all show up on
[SPEAKER_03]: election day, we could have a serious
authority coast to coast, but we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those of us that do show up,
don't show up unified, even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pushing your listeners, get out,
get out, start voting.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all will take a party bus anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you put a dab rig on a bus and a bong
on a bus, put some Rastaman with
[SPEAKER_07]: dreadlocks and some reggae music,
Rastaman driving it, reggae music playing
[SPEAKER_07]: real loud, and you paint a red,
golden green.
[SPEAKER_07]: People get on there and smoke some fucking
hash and smoke some joints and have a good
[SPEAKER_07]: ass social time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get one of those and pick up stoners
and drive them to polling places to get
[SPEAKER_07]: them to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an unheard of idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping a couple of the industry
players do something similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody that doesn't work a lot and have
a podcast and drive too much already,
[SPEAKER_07]: help me out with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put together some buses to go pick up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this possible?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this going to happen or am I just too
high?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this real?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get a bus and drive people to
polling places?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that somewhere like Denver that
would totally fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think something like Pueblo that might
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get away with driving them,
smoking them out while you drive them
[SPEAKER_03]: requires a lot of extra insurance and a
much, much larger vehicle, but every
[SPEAKER_03]: election there's groups that grab vans and
go bus seniors and other people that love
[SPEAKER_03]: to vote and have trouble sometimes getting
to the polling station and taking the
[SPEAKER_03]: seniors, but often vote the whatever way
they want them to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go round up those people and take
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Free joint if you vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't give stuff away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of little rules like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, duh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cheating.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cheating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just giving them a ride that's helping
someone perform their civic duty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see someone get legal trouble
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be an awesome court case.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, get involved, start Googling
after the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do it right now while you
listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're at work in your cubicle,
the bosses in behind you just fucking go
[SPEAKER_07]: ahead and start Googling.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just wanted to know what election day
was so you could think about requesting it
[SPEAKER_03]: off because civic pride is important to
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you're at work, just go to the
bathroom and act like you're taking a
[SPEAKER_07]: dump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go on there and Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come back out and tell all of your friends
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay, you're blushing like a monkey
from now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm laughing so hard over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know sometimes, you know you've gone
in there and taken like a seven minute pee
[SPEAKER_07]: just because you're in there checking
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know how big that place is?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like not even a liable way to hide,
like viable, not liable.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can hear you double tap when you like
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can like drop a pin in there and
they'd hear that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think something that Mike said on the
last podcast though, that's really
[SPEAKER_09]: important to say again though,
is that a lot of people this year are up
[SPEAKER_09]: for reelection.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we get the right people in the
right seats, we could be looking at this
[SPEAKER_09]: moving a lot faster than we really thought
it was going to.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're already at the breaking point.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're at 24 or 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: 24 medical, it looks like it's going to be
25 here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: But does that count Pennsylvania since
Pennsylvania is legalized?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, Pennsylvania is 24 I believe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So 24 plus DC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're still looking at 25.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're at the halfway mark.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's funny because my dad said
something really interesting to me the
[SPEAKER_09]: other day that at this point in a gay
marriage, it had already steamrolled and
[SPEAKER_09]: it went across all 50.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we just have to hold on for a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess who showed up in big groups?
[SPEAKER_03]: And voted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You win yourself a tasty dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew, but I didn't, I didn't know the
appropriate way to answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to, shout out to my sisters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I left that up to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of fun checking out chicks
with Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely a fun thing to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're blushing before you can blush more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep blushing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't see it on their show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I yell at you a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to motivate you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike doesn't mean to be a, no,
Mike does mean to be motivating and
[SPEAKER_07]: inspiring.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants you to go out and vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a chance that we can lose
recreational cannabis in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Politics and public opinion work on a
pendulum.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at your history, we swing from
liberal to conservative socially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so social issues like this can swing
back quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the early seventies, we had a president
that was thinking about legalizing
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana nationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a number of states that have passed
medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody remember these when we were
children?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the fucking eighties happened and
public opinion swung back the other way
[SPEAKER_03]: hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided to do a war on drugs instead of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know how that played out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And had a couple of candidates stayed in
the election or done better running up to
[SPEAKER_03]: this point, we could still have candidates
that were promising to send the military
[SPEAKER_03]: to stop Colorado's weed stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a reality in 2016 that we have
a major popular, well-funded candidate for
[SPEAKER_03]: the highest office in the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's talking about sending the army to
shut down weed stores in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys work in the retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to do one day when a
tank rolls up into the fucking parking
[SPEAKER_07]: lot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I work in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like, I don't know if that,
well, I guess if it, if it goes away for
[SPEAKER_09]: good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're there first in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're already in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the tank shows up, I'm going to stop
worrying about the consumption on site
[SPEAKER_03]: rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it down real quick and bounce with my
new rig and as much hash as I can carry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of new rig, big shout out to my
friends at Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I would just have to look over and
be like my bad hunt and start exactly like
[SPEAKER_09]: set up a station real quick and be like,
so who wants to go out real fast?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go outside and yell at the
tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the fuck is your boss?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I don't think that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they think that I don't
think they'd be surprised that I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: who wants to help me carry all the stuff
that we can carry out this window that's
[SPEAKER_03]: on the other side of the building from the
tank.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: How much can we shove in our pockets and
get out of here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm boofing a Keef Cola.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it weird?
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, did I take the lid off or
not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiny bubbles.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the weirdest podcasts I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cause it started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet us your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started around, it started after
midnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Start dabbing at 1140 to record.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is bound to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a great day though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big, big, big, huge respect to everybody
that I had fun with today.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who I always shout out to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, fucking Cooper, bro, Coops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you're doing the 22 pushups every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you started off really like a wiggle
worm by like day three, bro, you're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: pushups, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I think it's inspiring that you
actually, uh, posted the videos from the
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning when you knew you weren't
killing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I'm sure by day 22, you're going to
look like a fucking Marine dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people wouldn't even have the
heart or the balls to try it, let alone
[SPEAKER_07]: post the videos that you post.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay's over here putting her hand up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I, I don't even know if I can throw
down 22 to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't 22 girl ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you in 22 girl ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I told you that story,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That hunt had posted it and he had called
out all of the Nugs family and I'd liked
[SPEAKER_09]: it by accident before I like read through
the whole comment and I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: now I'm like obligated, but like,
I don't know how to do pushups.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who I was going to give a shout out
to next was our boy hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like something without reading the
whole post and now you have to like learn
[SPEAKER_03]: a new physical activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I couldn't like unlike it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I feel like that was rude too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, not like he would've noticed,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just was like, I'm just going to leave
this year like pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But big shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're talking about is the 22 pushups
for veterans because, uh, every so
[SPEAKER_07]: frequently I remember the stats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to post it for every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every day, 22 veterans commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of my friends are posting to
Facebook videos of themselves doing 22
[SPEAKER_07]: pushups every day for 22 days straight to
raise awareness for veterans, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: to show support for veterans, to help out,
to encourage people to reach out to
[SPEAKER_07]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a big shout out to John hunt,
uh, not just for doing this pushup
[SPEAKER_07]: challenge, but cause he's a bad
motherfucker every single day in every
[SPEAKER_07]: single way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that dude's an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_07]: He inspired coop to do pushups.
[SPEAKER_07]: He inspired me to do some pushups.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to inspire Lindsey to do them
before too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, he, he pushes everybody to the next
level, uh, in all aspects.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an inside joke, uh, aspects.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if you hang out with hunt one time,
you'll see why I use the word aspects,
[SPEAKER_07]: but a shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, yeah, some people that deserve to
shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody just nods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they can't hear our nods.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and if I'm going to talk about
veterans, I didn't plan, this wasn't part
[SPEAKER_07]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to give a shout out to coupon
hunt, uh, Steve Dufino, my friend,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, you deserve a huge shout out for what
you do with the veteran farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys are a veteran or have a friend
or relative that's a veteran, make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: you get them in touch with the veteran
farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a listener that sent me a message
saying they wanted to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve and I gave Steve your contact info
is easier for me to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve said he's attempted to contact you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that has gone through.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that was random.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a sidebar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but shout out to, uh, all the people
raising awareness for the veterans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be doing a lot more and
anything to raise awareness.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm for yes for anything that's worth
raising awareness for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been going for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, anybody got any final words to say
while you've got a microphone in front of
[SPEAKER_07]: you and a whole bunch of people are going
to hear your opinions and thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I laid down pretty much what I had to lay
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you did go out and get your shit
registered to vote and vote when the time
[SPEAKER_07]: comes because if we don't, we're going to
lose fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just seriously, we don't want to start
taking steps back now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's what could easily happen
in, uh, the next couple of election
[SPEAKER_03]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, I can really walk this backwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: How can people find you on Twitter?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me at, uh, at Nemo punk 15 on
Twitter or at Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you support Mike's Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws, Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Mike knows a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: He knows a lot about local cannabis laws
and rules.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, buddy.

night at 1 a.m.

[SPEAKER_07]: because the dog is so cute that it was
worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The look on your face.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, cause I know what dogs you're
talking about.

been like a cheap thing to do.

[SPEAKER_07]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic

tour this spring, so make sure you check
[SPEAKER_07]: them out if you can.

Theater and they will be at the Black
[SPEAKER_07]: Sheep in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be at the Black Sheep show.

[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, much love to my friends in the

[SPEAKER_07]: Also, while we're at it, this podcast is
brought to you by our good friends at
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, Elevate Glass in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you check out Elevate Glass at
517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're looking for an affordable rig,
if you need a new nail, if you need a
[SPEAKER_07]: nail, make sure you check out Elevate
Glass at 517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was under my assumption they got the
joint at the park because the news kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: made it look that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told that they got a coupon and they
had to take the coupon to the Smoke Club
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Smoke Club then gave them a joint
when they presented proper ID and that
[SPEAKER_07]: coupon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a correction had to be made.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not give the joints out at the
park.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did it correctly, so shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also shout out to my friends for
correcting me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope everybody had a great week because
I am recording on a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually I record on a Thursday,
but this week was chaotic.
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on Thursday, I had a medical
marijuana doctor at 930 in the morning in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I worked all day and then I went to
the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: The secret sesh was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost forgot part of my day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got up, I drove to Colorado Springs,
and then I got stuck in a fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I've never been stuck in an elevator
before, but Thursday morning, it happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was stuck in an elevator with two
strangers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't in there for very long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little bit freaky, but I didn't
panic or anything because I was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just in an elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: People know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's going to get me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the people in the elevator was a
couple, and the older dude was getting a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit pissed off that he was stuck in
an elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason for him to be mad,
but I think just the simple idea that he
[SPEAKER_07]: was stuck pissed him off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to the medical marijuana
doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I walked in.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no stairs at this building,
oddly.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got in the elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: More people walked in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I held the door for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit floor three.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It went, and then it stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at the dude, and I was like,
I don't know that I want to be in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I think we're stuck in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, if it stops, and then it stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: My first instinct was trying to pull the
door open just to see where we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: How far up did we go?
[SPEAKER_07]: How far down did we go?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where the fuck we went.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tried to pull the door open.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good and stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little alarm button on the
elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit that, and then there's a button that
says call for help.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit that.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple seconds later, a young lady
answered.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, did I just call the front desk
or what the fuck just happened?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, hey, I'm stuck in the
elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: She asked if I was at the address where I
was, and I confirmed that.
[SPEAKER_07]: She said, okay, hang tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send someone to get you out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, that's kind of just
basic, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask if we're okay or some shit.
Jeez.
[SPEAKER_07]: We sat in the elevator for a few minutes,
and then another person, I kept hitting
[SPEAKER_07]: the little alarm button.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just go jingle, jingle,
jingle, so that somebody would know I was
[SPEAKER_07]: in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then another person came, and they're
like, hey, are you stuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yes, we're stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: She just started pushing buttons.
[SPEAKER_07]: When she pushed, I don't know which
button, because I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_07]: When she pushed the button, I could feel
the elevator shift a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, hey, keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I saw through the crack in the door,
I could see that we were only six or eight
[SPEAKER_07]: inches up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd only moved half a foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, keep doing that, because we're
going down every time she did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I saw the little threshold piece
where the elevator would fit into the
[SPEAKER_07]: floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit pushing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want her to squish my fingers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I stuck my fingers in her, and I totally
just pulled the door open.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to slide the door open once she
got it a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were a little bit late for our medical
marijuana doctor appointment, but what can
[SPEAKER_07]: you do?
[SPEAKER_07]: I called them, and I said, hey,
I'm stuck in the elevator, so please don't
[SPEAKER_07]: screw up my appointment.
[SPEAKER_07]: They took me.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got me in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to my medical marijuana
doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I should say his name on the
air, because he's crowded already.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know my medical marijuana doctor,
you give him a high five.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a quick, easy appointment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got everything handled the way that I
needed to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got out of the elevator, went to the
doctor, saw the doctor, went and took care
[SPEAKER_07]: of the gardens all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to John Randall Jr. Big
shout out to Zach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a huge shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody kicked ass in the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, you guys, I got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the dispensary and bought a
bunch of Turpex shatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_07]: The new packaging is dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Lemon G, I might have grown that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Lemon G live resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff was fire, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, I went and got some hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, I headed up to Denver, where I went
to the secret sesh, and I met up with our
[SPEAKER_07]: buddy, John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I want to give a shout out to
everybody that I got to dab with at the
[SPEAKER_07]: secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dabbed with so many people that I'm not
even going to say one name, because I will
[SPEAKER_07]: forget somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were at secret sesh and we took a
dab, much love.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam Il said, I'm higher than everybody
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was pretty sure that I was higher than
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no, you're not.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes, Ross and Jeff, I see you shaking
your head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come here, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: He called me up to the stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: His buddy, Tim, gave me ... That was at
least a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I took a gram and a half dab on
the stage at the secret sesh in front of
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody and did not choke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, we brought up a couple of people on
the stage and dabbed them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pretty good time, but honestly,
I was lit up because I would give people a
[SPEAKER_07]: two gram dab and whatever they couldn't
take, I would finish it for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oftentimes, it was most of a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: You try to dab somebody a two gram dab and
they start choking and they look at you
[SPEAKER_07]: like, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just grab it and finish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was pretty lit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We took a little break and went and sat in
the green room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate a bunch of Cheetos, drank some Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually don't eat a bunch of crap,
but I needed some crap in my body,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I ate a bunch of junk and got my shit
back together.
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was sitting in the green room
chilling out, our good friend,
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay, the traveling stoner showed up
and she had her beautiful friend,
[SPEAKER_07]: Molly, with her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Lindsay and Molly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They encouraged me to have another bag of
chips and get my shit together and then
[SPEAKER_07]: get back to the party.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lindsay and our new friend, Molly and I
went and cruised around the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to our friend at TNT
Extractions.
[SPEAKER_07]: That dude gave me a donut that got me
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to whoever made the pink
lemonade cupcakes with the peppermint bark
[SPEAKER_07]: on top of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, my brain still may be fuzzy from
the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there were 250 or 300 milligrams
each and I ate two of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had some fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was pineapple and strawberries and
some other random fruit that was chopped
[SPEAKER_07]: up that had medicated chocolate ganache
that was hot on top of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the secret sesh, I got stupid lit.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you walked up and tried to talk to me
and I was kind of non-responsive,
[SPEAKER_07]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had eaten about 850 to 1,000 milligrams
of edibles and I had smoked about four or
[SPEAKER_07]: five grams of hash, so I was in no
condition to be conversational.
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, but shout out to everyone at
the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge shout out to our friends at TNT
Extractions and Schumet Edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those dudes gave me a 1,000 milligram
edible and I ate that 1,000 milligram
[SPEAKER_07]: edible yesterday on my way to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time I got to work, it felt like
somebody had replaced my blood with sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: My body was so dry and heavy that I just
wanted to curl up in a corner and take a
[SPEAKER_07]: nap.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not been that ridiculously high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I wasted probably a day and a
half because the entire day I was useless
[SPEAKER_07]: and then half of today, it took me half of
the day to get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 1,000 milligrams will fuck you up if
that's what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_07]: but oh my God, I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a shamanic journey,
but I had to go and live my day doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to go to work and I had to function.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do that unless you can lay around
and just be lazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to those folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, if you can make it to the next
Secret Sesh, you need to be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Adam Mill and all those
kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to try to list names because
I will forget mad people, but we're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to move forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys, I want to get into some
iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't read the iTunes comments in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are one or two more that we
haven't read.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pulling up iTunes right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting to the comment section.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like it if you guys would go to
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_07]: Type in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me the amount of stars that you feel
I deserve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me know what you think about the
show because I really do appreciate
[SPEAKER_07]: reading the comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found the new comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our new comment comes from our friend
Tarantula Hawk.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: He left this comment May 18th,
2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: To date, this is hands down the best
informational cannabis grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rasta Jeff doesn't overload you with
endless advertising.
[SPEAKER_07]: Informative, free and entertaining.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love to Jeff and the crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like it, review it and donate a few
bucks straight up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a hell of a good comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something I noticed when I used to
listen to another cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: People would ask a grow question and
instead of giving solid grow advice,
[SPEAKER_07]: the host of that show would sell you a
product and it wouldn't solve your
[SPEAKER_07]: problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would temporarily solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would mask your problem is what it
would do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'd have to keep buying that
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I like to do is if you have a problem
in your grow, if you say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: I have spider mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to help you figure out how you're
getting spider mites, teach you how to
[SPEAKER_07]: correct that so that you don't ever get
mites again, instead of having to buy some
[SPEAKER_07]: product that is sponsoring me over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do appreciate that you noticed that
free and entertaining and informative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the things I aim to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love to me and the crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will share the love with the crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they're all listening right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys, this dude tarantula hot gave
us mad love and then give your mom a hug
[SPEAKER_07]: for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will do that and then review it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys review the podcast, go to iTunes
and leave a review just like this guy
[SPEAKER_07]: says, and then also donate a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, PayPal did not like me
having a cannabis related podcast linked
[SPEAKER_07]: to their PayPal service.
[SPEAKER_07]: So PayPal has shut me down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not have a way to receive donations,
but if you'd like to make a contribution
[SPEAKER_07]: to the show, send me an email grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will figure out how to receive your
contribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to Tarantula Hawk.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gave us a five-star rating and wrote a
super, super sweet comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next comment comes from 100% Clint.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if that's Clint that's
been on the show or if that's just a
[SPEAKER_07]: listener, but they gave us a five-star
review and they left a comment on May 20th
[SPEAKER_07]: of 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it simply says, give your mom a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So next time I see my mom, I owe her two
hugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want you guys to do the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time you see your mom, just give her
a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell her Rasta Jeff says, hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: She knows who I am.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, that was the iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank everybody that sent a
comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you to go to iTunes,
like I said, and post a little comment
[SPEAKER_07]: post review.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got something you'd like to say,
and you don't want to do it on the iTunes
[SPEAKER_07]: comments, you can always send me an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course I am on all of the social
media.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find me, support all of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking of social media, a couple of
days ago, I saw a post from my friend
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole West.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Nicole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole is, she's well established in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: She posted something to Facebook that I
thought I would share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, dear people applying for jobs in
the cannabis industry, just a few tips.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can support everything she says
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tip number one, please do not make the
first sentence of your intro email be,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can pass a drug test.
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be self-explanatory,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, if you failed at attaching the
correct document or attaching the document
[SPEAKER_07]: correctly the first three times,
I don't think the fourth time is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: get you your job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, when you're going to attach,
when you send in your resume to work at a
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary, you need to include a copy of
your badge and probably a copy of your ID,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there will probably be more documents.
[SPEAKER_07]: Attach that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Attach your resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you guys, I heard a friend talking
about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine got an email that was
addressed to the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend's name is Lee.
[SPEAKER_07]: The email said, hey, Brian.
[SPEAKER_07]: This indicates to me and Lee that this
email was a mass email sent to multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: people and all the person was doing was
going and changing the name as who the
[SPEAKER_07]: letter was addressed to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, make sure you change that shit
if you're sending an application or a
[SPEAKER_07]: resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't say dear live well when you're
trying to work for the clinic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you get that shit correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: So number three, do not ask me to how to
get a badge in your intro email.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're applying for a job, do not ask
the person giving you the job how to get
[SPEAKER_07]: your badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a whole episode on how to get
your badge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back and listen to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll truly help you out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number four, please do not spend the
entire interview talking about how shitty
[SPEAKER_07]: the last dispensary you worked for treated
everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you worked for another dispensary and
you're trying to work for ours,
[SPEAKER_07]: we don't want to hear about the problems
at the old place.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that you're dramatic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that you're going to bring some
bullshit to our place that we simply do
[SPEAKER_07]: not need.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep your drama at home, especially
during an interview.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number five, no basic weights and
measurements.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're coming to work at a dispensary,
know what an eighth weighs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know what a quarter weighs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know what a half ounce weighs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know what an ounce weighs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know it well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Start understanding weights.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to be quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be able to eyeball an eighth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be able to throw an eighth on
the scale just by grabbing it and tossing
[SPEAKER_07]: it on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get good at that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, 3.5 grams is an eighth.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 28.35 grams in an ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: That 0.35 does matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people skip the 28.35.
[SPEAKER_07]: 28.35 is a true ounce, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do your math from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then number six, regardless of the job
you're applying for, always dress
[SPEAKER_07]: professional at interviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you're coming in to be a trimmer,
even if you're coming in just to be an
[SPEAKER_07]: entry level person at a dispensary,
look good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to look presentable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be around products that people
are going to buy and consume.
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't want scuzzy people hovering
over their cake or their baked goods.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want scuzzy people hovering over
the medicine that you're going to smoke,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially in a medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need clean people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a clean environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys, those were a few tips that my
friend Nicole posted to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it would be really helpful to
share this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a smart ass stab at people
trying to get a job, but it's so real that
[SPEAKER_07]: it was worth sharing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she meant to post something smart ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took it seriously because some people
need some help with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to Nicole West,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: My throat is getting dry as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the point in the show where I'm
going to press pause, take a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: dabs, take a drink, and I will be right
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm back and I have dabbed the fuck
out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Elevate Glass at 517 South
[SPEAKER_07]: Tejon in beautiful downtown Colorado
Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you check out Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need a new rig, if you need a new
nail, if you need some smoking
[SPEAKER_07]: accessories, I highly recommend Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, one more important thing I need to
mention, you guys, I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to remind you again politely,
kindly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not mad at you, but I cannot ship
anybody any seeds at this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not send seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're looking for seeds, I can
recommend that you search the internet for
[SPEAKER_07]: thedankteam.com, the D-A-N-K team,
dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They may be able to help you out,
but I certainly cannot get you any seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, that's enough
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to an email that I received.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one came from our friend Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Rasta Seb down there in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for being the coolest Facebook
troll ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like we're bros.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like we've sat around and smoked
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never met the dude in person,
but he is family now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you follow Rasta Seb on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let him know that you found out about him
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He makes some really funny memes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I act like I don't see them
because I don't even know what the fuck to
[SPEAKER_07]: say.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he sent me a long Facebook message with
several questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go through a couple of them
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one, he says, how can a humble,
simple ganja farmer folk avoid buying an
[SPEAKER_07]: RO and get rid of chloramides?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's asking how he can get rid of the
chlorine and whatever else the water
[SPEAKER_07]: company is putting in your water without
buying a reverse osmosis machine because
[SPEAKER_07]: those are quite expensive and sometimes
people can't afford that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you don't have anywhere to put
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can a simple ganja farmer get rid
of the chlorine and the stuff that the
[SPEAKER_07]: city is putting in our municipal water?
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite simply, you can put it in a giant
jug and set it in the sun and the sun will
[SPEAKER_07]: help evaporate off any of those
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I recommend putting, if you need to
do it indoors, if you have to do it
[SPEAKER_07]: indoors, most of us have to, put the
water, put the tap water in a reservoir,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever size you're using, and put a lot
of air stones in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put air stones in there and make it bubble
real heavily because then you'll move all
[SPEAKER_07]: that water around in surface area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me for clearing my throat over and
over again, but surface area is what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want to bring some of that water
from the bottom up to the top and help
[SPEAKER_07]: move some of that chlorine that's trapped
in there up to the top and then it can
[SPEAKER_07]: evaporate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the easiest way is just to put your
water in a big container and put air
[SPEAKER_07]: stones in it and bubble the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get yourself a nice air bubbler.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_07]: An air pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get yourself a nice powerful one.
[SPEAKER_07]: They make one that's got like eight air
things coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put all eight of them in like a 30 gallon
trash can and fill that sucker with water
[SPEAKER_07]: and just pump the shit out of the air into
there and that'll get rid of the chlorine
[SPEAKER_07]: or the chloramide or whatever you're
worried about in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get rid of most of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course, before you give that
to your plants, make sure you adjust the
[SPEAKER_07]: pH.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check the pH of that, adjust it before you
feed it to your plants to depending on the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant's age, their pH, they will want
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how you can get rid of that
stuff and it's free and it doesn't take
[SPEAKER_07]: much but time and a little bit of energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have to go buy yourself an air
pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second question Seb asked is thoughts
on mycorrhizae and trichoderma bacteria
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficials do you use and how much?
[SPEAKER_07]: So he wants to know which of these
beneficials I use and how much.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several brands out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're mostly the same, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several brands that I like.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I like OG BioWarr.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: The chunkier white ones seem to work the
best for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much?
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: When my clones come out of the cloner and
they're going into a cup of soil or a
[SPEAKER_07]: small pot of soil, I like to sprinkle a
little bit of the Great White Shark around
[SPEAKER_07]: the base area where the roots are going to
hit and then put, or also I can't forget
[SPEAKER_07]: this one, Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
they make a lush roots is also a great
[SPEAKER_07]: product for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dust the roots in there or put a little
right where the roots are going to go and
[SPEAKER_07]: then bury the plant into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I let the roots grow in that cup or small
container for a long time until it's
[SPEAKER_07]: almost too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I transplant it into the next
container and as I do, I'll coat right
[SPEAKER_07]: where I'm going to put the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll coat that area with just a sprinkle
of whatever powdered root inoculant sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of thing that I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's Great White Shark, if it's OG
BioWarr, whichever brand you're using,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can use OGT.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a whole bunch of different
products.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're mostly the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like the Great White Shark.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: OG BioWarr is affordable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth its weight in gold,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those would be the two I'd recommend,
the Great White Shark or the OG BioWarr,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can't use too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use it when you go from the cloner into
the cup and then when you go from the cup
[SPEAKER_07]: into the pot and then if you go into
another pot, do it again every time right
[SPEAKER_07]: where you're putting those roots,
the fresh roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just put some of that into the dirt right
where those roots are going to touch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I like to fill a container with clean
water and then I just mix the powdered
[SPEAKER_07]: solution into the water with my nutrients
and feed it to the plants just like a
[SPEAKER_07]: water feed, just like I feed all my other
nutrients and I feel that that helps soak
[SPEAKER_07]: it in there real good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I've got some that was in there
with the roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I put it in there in the dirt,
it's already touching it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The roots are eating it and then I feed
some in kind of like a tea so that it can
[SPEAKER_07]: get more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like to give it that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it these things all through the veg
phase, maybe once every other week through
[SPEAKER_07]: the veg phase and then do it the first
three weeks in flower would not be a bad
[SPEAKER_07]: idea at all because you want to build
those roots and keep those roots moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that answers your question,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which beneficials do I recommend?
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next question, you said my thoughts
on LED lights, the benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're thinking better tricone production
maybe if used in conjunction with HBS,
[SPEAKER_07]: not to mention energy savings,
10 to one or similar lumens output.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a lot of great shit come from
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any experience with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, they're expensive and I'm afraid
to invest in a light that's not going to
[SPEAKER_07]: make my plants perform the way that they
need.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the right situation, if you're in a
small area and you can't run a big light,
[SPEAKER_07]: do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If what you're able to do is run an LED,
run an LED.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Amanda has an LED and I've seen
pictures of her cannabis plants and they
[SPEAKER_07]: look good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't argue with the LED.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend, Nancy Budwell, I don't know if
she listens to this podcast, but shout out
[SPEAKER_07]: to Nancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: She grows with a lush LED and her plants
look fucking stellar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her plants look really, really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: She does a great job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a lot of great stuff from LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't have any experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are totally accurate with the cost
effectiveness of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They really do keep electricity costs
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lights themselves don't pull as much
power, which means they don't make as much
[SPEAKER_07]: heat, which means you don't need as much
air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get the right LEDs, I'm sure that
there are some cheap China made ones out
[SPEAKER_07]: there that you wouldn't want to purchase.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there are some great American
made LEDs that would work very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just do your research if you're going
to buy an LED.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's the best I could say on
their tricone production.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to help you out with tricone
production because you're getting more
[SPEAKER_07]: types of light.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to make the plants grow a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, it's going to change the,
gosh, I'm sorry, you guys, I'm just
[SPEAKER_07]: choking up over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to change the nutritive cycle
of that plant a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to speed it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like cause it's getting more
different light.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to probably need to feed a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be adjustments to be made if you
shift from an HPS to an LED, or if you add
[SPEAKER_07]: an LED to your HPS room, you're going to
see different shit happening that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to have to adjust to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Subcool hang a lush LED in his HPS
room and the plant underneath it hated it,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that's just because it wasn't
Subcool's grow style.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to have to adjust some
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that answered your question about
LEDs in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next one is why, I want to ask why
more commercial grows don't get solar to
[SPEAKER_07]: offset massive power costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, at the amount of electricity
we're using, I don't know that solar would
[SPEAKER_07]: even be a viable source.
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't know enough about solar.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something I would have to research,
but honestly, we pull, we've got 85,
[SPEAKER_07]: 1000 watt lights in one room and 25,
1000 watt lights in another room.
[SPEAKER_07]: The electricity bill is high, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've also got shit, tons,
tons and tons of air conditioning on top
[SPEAKER_07]: of that building that just keep us cool
all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really warm today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not really warm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fairly warm today outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to get way hotter, but it was
fairly warm and the building was nice and
[SPEAKER_07]: cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was probably 74 degrees in the whole
building and we've got a nice office
[SPEAKER_07]: space.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a trim area.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a shit ton of lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think, wow, that motorcycle was so
loud.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys heard that because it kind
of scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that we could get enough
electricity through solar to run all of
[SPEAKER_07]: the stuff that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I am not an electrical engineer
or anywhere educated in any means of solar
[SPEAKER_07]: power, but that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would assume.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would guess, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then he asked me question number five,
Seb said, how do you keep so cool under
[SPEAKER_07]: pressure when the cop pulled you over?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he also said, being responsible
for so much medicine and patients,
[SPEAKER_07]: does it keep you awake at night worrying
about timers and stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: Any tips on how to relax and not freak out
like I tend to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shit bro, I didn't worry about
timers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until you just pointed it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm having a damn panic attack and I
want to check the cameras on my phone and
[SPEAKER_07]: see if everything at the grow is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just totally joking with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I keep my cool under pressure like
when that cop pulled me over?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm a grown ass adult and that cop's
just a grown ass man with a job to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't have anything to hide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess being a white dude with a nice
car probably helped me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't feel like I was worried about
too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I mean, we know I'm not even
kidding if I was a different race,
[SPEAKER_07]: it could have been a totally different
outcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not accusing this cop of anything,
but we know how things go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So being a spoiled white dude helps me out
for sure in that case, keeping my cool
[SPEAKER_07]: with the cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just well-educated and I speak
well and I'm very sociable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't worry about cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just people with a job to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're not doing anything stupid
and hiding anything, most of the time you
[SPEAKER_07]: should be cool, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just, I hoped for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's how I stayed cool with the
cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I'm not intimidated by people.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are people.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the person next to me is Rasta Seb,
if the person next to me is white Mike,
[SPEAKER_07]: if the person sitting next to me is
Lindsay, or if the person sitting next to
[SPEAKER_07]: me is the president, or if the person
sitting next to me is whoever,
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all fart.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all poop.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have to go pee.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all need to eat food to live life.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have feelings.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all just people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't, people don't make me nervous.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all just people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like rock stars are just people that play
guitars real well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get nervous around people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how I keep cool in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The part about being responsible for so
much medicine and patients, and does it
[SPEAKER_07]: keep me awake at night?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I wouldn't be in the position
if the people that put me, that let me
[SPEAKER_07]: have this position didn't have full trust
of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would not, I wouldn't even do it if
I didn't have faith in myself that I could
[SPEAKER_07]: do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say straight up like, Hey,
this is not my thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't handle this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I've got good backup.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is my, I do run that grow by myself for
the most part, but if I need help,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can call hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt will come help.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can call Zach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach will come help.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a trimmer that's there trimming
eight days a week now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can have him help me if there is
trouble in the grow that I need help with.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I am responsible for it,
but it doesn't keep me awake at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the building really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know every timer in the building.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what time everything clicks on,
what time everything clicks off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what the temperature is in each
room right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't worry too much about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you said, does it keep you awake
at night?
[SPEAKER_07]: Worrying about timers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one time, dude, it was late,
it was midnight and I was laying down to
[SPEAKER_07]: go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought I should check the cameras
at the grow just to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an hour away from my house in
good weather.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I look at the camera and I can see that
this one pump has broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see it on the camera that a tank
that should have been fed to these plants
[SPEAKER_07]: was totally full and the pump had not
pumped in several hours, probably six good
[SPEAKER_07]: hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if these plants didn't get a drink of
water within the next three or four hours,
[SPEAKER_07]: it probably were going to die.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was midnight and I was getting
ready to go to bed and I saw this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I did the only thing I could do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put on my shoes and I got in my car and
I drove the hour there and I fixed the
[SPEAKER_07]: pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, it took me maybe five minutes to
fix that pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I got back in the car and my car had
broken down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't start.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to get my car fucking towed home
that night.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really funny because it was five
in the morning by the time I got home.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have cameras, I can check and see if
anything goes really wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at this point I've been there long
enough to where I know, like I said
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier, I know every timer in that
building.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know every breaker in the breaker box.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know every, if a leaf moves in that
room, I know which plant it was on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how well I know that grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't stress me out too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't keep me up at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, if you smoked as much hash as I did
and smoked as many edibles as I did,
[SPEAKER_07]: you'd have no problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sleeping at night, but I just have
faith in myself, honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a confident dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take a lot of notes, honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I write notes on everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got billions of little post-it notes
all over the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That helps me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That honestly helps me keep my cool
because just all the shit that I need to
[SPEAKER_07]: do is right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once I figure, finish a couple of
tasks, I cross them off the list and throw
[SPEAKER_07]: the post-it note away.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you give me something that I need to
remember, I just write it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just keep post-it notes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That really helps me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that really helps me keep
my shit together.
[SPEAKER_07]: That helps me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any tips on how to relax and not freak out
like you tend to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just chill out, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you so fucking worried about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of you, chill out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you're doing, be confident.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're probably going to fuck up,
but that's life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you do, fix it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like seriously, I run a big ass grow and I
was talking to a guy, we're opening a new
[SPEAKER_07]: facility and I was talking to a guy and
he's like, so what's the first thing you
[SPEAKER_07]: do when you get here?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, honestly, the first thing you
do every morning when you walk into a big
[SPEAKER_07]: facility is find the surprise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm going to say twice a week,
I walk into the grow and there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: surprise.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other day, a breaker had flipped and a
cloner filled with clones that I really
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: The breaker flipped and that cloner,
all those clones died because the breaker
[SPEAKER_07]: went out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And today the building next door to mine,
all of their power went out because of a
[SPEAKER_07]: breaker.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had nothing to do with me, but I mean,
there's always weird shit like that going
[SPEAKER_07]: on in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always going to be surprises.
[SPEAKER_07]: So no matter how hard you do it,
you're going to get some kind of surprise
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's how you deal with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just be ready to deal with some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't freak out and have faith in
yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just know that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got this far and you're going to fuck
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter how old you are, no matter how
much you've done it, you're going to make
[SPEAKER_07]: some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we are, but laugh at yourself too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you overflow a reservoir,
get the squeegee and push that water down
[SPEAKER_07]: to the drain and then mop up the floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then next time, don't overflow that
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you kill a plant, remember what you
did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't kill a plant again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I stay, so I don't freak out
about stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been at this a long time and I've
dealt with a lot of mistakes and a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that I'm prepared to deal with
almost anything you can throw at me in a
[SPEAKER_07]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I haven't dealt with it yet,
I'm ready to learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how I don't freak out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just stay confident and know that I got
this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's life.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants are going to die.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reservoirs are going to overflow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lights are going to fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen lights just completely fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen tables fall over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Random shit happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just confident that I can deal with it
when it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of that is because I've got a little
bit of faith in me in some other things,
[SPEAKER_07]: so it makes me confident.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy, Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seb, thank you for five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you send me five good questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: There were more questions in that message,
but I been going for 33 minutes now,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I feel like most people only stick
around for 36 minutes is what the
[SPEAKER_07]: statistics show when I look at my stats
for my podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like you guys like a 36 minute
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're getting close to that,
which means I should start wrapping this
[SPEAKER_07]: shit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks everybody who listened for this
far.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have more emails with more questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am getting to those.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you send me a message, if you send me
an email, I will answer your questions,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get emails and messages on a lot of
different platforms, so it's hard to find
[SPEAKER_07]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be really cool of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can send your questions and
comments to me through the email,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will check that, and then all the
podcast stuff will be right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just look at it and be like,
oh, look, there's Bill's email,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I can just read it and it'll be
so much easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool if you want to send them on
Facebook and all that, but sometimes I
[SPEAKER_07]: lose them and I forget where they are,
and then I got to go searching.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I try to take screenshots, honestly,
when I have your email and I want to use
[SPEAKER_07]: it, I screenshot it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got a picture of it, but anyway,
send me questions via email.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be really rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, shout out to our friends at
Elevate Glass, 517 South Tahoe,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I may have said the wrong address in a
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevate, I'm sorry, smoke a lot of dabs
and you gave me a cool rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Chris, also known as Bobo Blaster
[SPEAKER_07]: Co.
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs a hug, so I'm going to send it to
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big virtual hug to you, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait till you get back from your
little trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope things are well for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, earlier I was talking about the
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Lindsey for hanging out with
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Molly for hanging out with me
and keeping me alive because I may have
[SPEAKER_07]: taken an app in that damn chair if you
ladies did not rescue me.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, this is the end of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be really cool if you went to iTunes
and do what those other folks did at the
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to iTunes, find the iTunes store,
go to the review section.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Type in, find the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, find the review section,
[SPEAKER_07]: type in a little comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think about the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Type in some stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just click on some stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say give me five, but that's kind
of begging.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think I only deserve three,
throw me three stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So go there, leave a comment, throw me
some stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what would be even cooler is if you
told like three or five of your friends
[SPEAKER_07]: about the podcast, you're like,
dude, you should hear this guy's podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can listen to it on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can listen to it on iTunes,
or you can even hear it on Tok Radio,
[SPEAKER_07]: tokradio.com on Wednesdays at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can even go to his website.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ireageneticscolorado.com and go to
the podcast tab and you can listen to all
[SPEAKER_07]: the episodes there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell your friends about that shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you tell like three to five people,
maybe one or two of them will start
[SPEAKER_07]: listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's just how shit is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everyone's going to listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But tell a lot of people, and then a
couple of few people listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then more people are going to learn
how to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then more people are going to learn
about freeing the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: More people are going to learn about the
healing properties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then eventually, you know what's going
to happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to legalize cannabis
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to be a sponsor of the
podcast, or if you've got a product you'd
[SPEAKER_07]: like me to review, all you've got to do is
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to get you all of the
information that you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, that's all I've got for this
week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be back in seven days with another
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my buddy Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to my ninja Spitz.
[SPEAKER_12]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for her.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see you next time.
We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesdays at one o'clock on tokeradio
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big old shout out to my buddy Citizen J.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for putting me on the network.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's all of the official
business that I need to spit out for right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys look high.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're staring at me like, dude,
thank you for turning down that fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: music.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got show notes, and so far the
topic's a secret, but I'm way too big to
[SPEAKER_03]: read upside down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't know about a secret.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got an email that I wanted to read,
and I'm sure that you'll have a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: things to chime in with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because yeah, always.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lindsay always has good shit to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: She brings up good points that I overlook.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got an email that's part of the
topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does he want me to say his name or not?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say his name because he's
from an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says that he lives in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, hi, my name is something and I
live in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if you could do an
episode about how to control fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how to control fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not too hard of a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a good method, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a great method.
[SPEAKER_03]: My one and only bug solution that I ever
had the power to implement and really
[SPEAKER_03]: carry out to my own desire is sort of
nuclear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go hard the one time you got bugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: The one time I got bugs, I got
spider-mited bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to town.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a month long process that involves a
couple of gallons of bleach and killing
[SPEAKER_03]: everything you own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant-wise, it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a breeder, I don't have that option.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a breeder, I cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have to fight,
but no fungus gnats was never one I really
[SPEAKER_03]: had to play with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this dude's asking about fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fungus gnats occur.
[SPEAKER_07]: They show up when your soil is kept too
moist or when your medium is kept too
[SPEAKER_07]: moist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm growing in a giant commercial
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that warehouse, we've got a giant
floor drain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And oftentimes I see little fucking fungus
gnats trying to fly up through that floor
[SPEAKER_07]: drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They transfer pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the peat moss traveling
fuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love peat moss.
[SPEAKER_07]: They come in soil all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You buy bags of soil and they're in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've helped people fight these
infestations.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can keep moisture levels down a
little bit in your soil, let your dirt dry
[SPEAKER_07]: up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll help get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can use diatomaceous earth on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the soil dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Apply diatomaceous earth to the top of the
soil or the medium, if you got cocoa,
[SPEAKER_07]: and just leave it on there while it's dry
and then water a little later.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to put that shit on there while
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then those bugs won't want to climb in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I recommend, if you're trying to stay
all organic, there are little things at
[SPEAKER_07]: Lowe's or Home Depot called mosquito
dunks.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just little donut looking things
in a red package.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put those in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Submerge them in the water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them sit there for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll kind of get mushy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wear a rubber glove and rub them in your
hand and grind them up a little bit to
[SPEAKER_07]: where they turn into a powder and let that
sit in your reservoir and put a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: of that in each plant when you water.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a beneficial bacteria that I cannot
remember the name of right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it, but since I'm trying to tell
you, it's gone out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that beneficial bacteria will kill off
the fungus gnats, and it's cheap,
[SPEAKER_07]: effective, and organic in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're doing a big grow, you may need a
product like natural, and you do the exact
[SPEAKER_07]: same process.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just feed that into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to want to triple
check that against your state's list if
[SPEAKER_03]: your state's gotten that far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a home grow letter,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is a home grow guy in an
illegal state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're going- Dude, the mosquito
dunk solution is not a bad one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, go back and listen to the
episodes about ways of maintaining your
[SPEAKER_03]: garden to really prevent infestations from
occurring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, with fungus gnats,
a lot of times people bring them home from
[SPEAKER_03]: the grow store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they come in the soil quite often.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had thrips come in soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say that I've had spider mites
come in soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two people I've helped deal with this,
one of them got them when the guy that
[SPEAKER_03]: lived in the other side of the split level
started to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, two separate grows in one
domicile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude that started the second little
fun closet grow brought home fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_03]: in his soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caused the guy growing on the other side
of the grow immensely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other person I know that got
him, that neighbor on the other side of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fence, or the other side of the alley
rather.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't figure out where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of wandered in and found the
plant and went nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was our best guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we heard them harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were bitching about all the
little white bugs flying out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like, that's where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've got those bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can't retaliate or say anything
right now because we don't want them to
[SPEAKER_03]: know we had plants back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought their weed smelled good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were smelling our weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, neither of those were under my
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: But both of them were really hard to
prevent type situations.
[SPEAKER_07]: The way to get rid of fungus gnats,
I think, is either the dunks or natural
[SPEAKER_07]: and dry out your soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always use Asimax as a soil
drench.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use it really lightly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mix it in with water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not know the ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says on the container as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pour a little bit Asimax into some
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just water the plants with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll help you out with fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't go that route unless it's
extreme, but it will work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless your plants are really healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that I would do it,
but it'll work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like you're at least headed to
Lowe's or the local hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go to Lowe's and try.
[SPEAKER_07]: So put the mosquito dunks in there and
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you have the time,
depending on how big your plants are,
[SPEAKER_07]: cover up the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can maybe take a paper plate and
cut a slit up it and then put the stem in
[SPEAKER_07]: that slit and then cover up the soil so
that the bugs don't have a way in or out,
[SPEAKER_07]: then the bugs that are in there will stay
in there and die.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more bugs will be able to land in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't be breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll help you keep more shit out,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the paper plate method will be totally
helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Diatinaceous earth if you want to go hard
on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the mosquito dunks or some
natural will solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, part two of this email.
[SPEAKER_07]: This dude says, also, could you speak
about the laws in Pueblo, Colorado for
[SPEAKER_07]: growing your own medicine?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe about four to six plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he says, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the show and enjoy all of the
educational.
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn, excuse that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the educational information you
give.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to let Mike talk a little bit
about growing laws in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the city and the county of Pueblo
are two different legal entities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dropping dimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a nickel, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you dropping nickels?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city and county both have slightly
different rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: For four to six plants, though,
in all of Colorado, any adult can legally
[SPEAKER_03]: grow six plants just because Amendment 64
passed and marijuana is legal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you keep no more than three
plants per adult in the household in
[SPEAKER_03]: flower, and then say you were living
inside city limits, you kept those no more
[SPEAKER_03]: than three plants in flower, and then your
three veg plants, and no more than 100
[SPEAKER_03]: square foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd pretty much be covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty small grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to make it a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted to live in your plant
count.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically me and one other citizen who
does not like his name being shared
[SPEAKER_03]: publicly, but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the help with that fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he listen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just recently at his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does amazing work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so in the city, you just got to
keep your grow restricted to the total
[SPEAKER_03]: square footage under 100 square feet,
which is 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the county, it's there's a square foot
limit, I think overall, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a plant count that's
total per household.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're talking about just growing
your own six legal plants under Amendment
[SPEAKER_03]: 64, for say you and a domestic partner,
that would be 12 plants total.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're under the under the limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, before you started your grow
in either of those locations, I would
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend heading to the appropriate
zoning department because there are two of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just asking politely for a copy of the
homegirl rules, which they're happy to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you or tell you how to find so that
you can go home and follow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, there's a bunch of raids
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that moved here didn't read the
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of them are quoted as going,
yeah, come in and look like it's legal
[SPEAKER_03]: here, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, but there's rules and you
ain't going to jail just like you would in
[SPEAKER_03]: Texas or Florida for the same crimes with
the same penalties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we it's legal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird conundrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rules are easy to follow,
especially if you're looking for personal
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play with your numbers and your
growth base and stuff and kind of maximize
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a small grow four to six plants,
it's super easy to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some counties have made different grow
plant count limits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some counties don't have any plant count
limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That changes in every legal jurisdiction
in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or in Colorado, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you go to the medical marijuana
doctor, you can ask them to possibly
[SPEAKER_07]: recommend more plants so that you can have
more medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll write you an extended plant
count if you qualify.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in some counties, you're able to
grow however many your card says.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of counties have limited you a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have more and more counties and
cities, towns, everything, every little
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're starting to pass rules limiting
the total size of a home cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, unless you own property where
you could grow acres and acres of corn
[SPEAKER_03]: within the next year or two, expect that
that area will have passed a limit of at
[SPEAKER_03]: least 20 plants or maybe 200 or 300 square
feet total growth space in a private
[SPEAKER_03]: residence in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a pretty fair bet.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope we answered your question very
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we got into that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for your help on that, Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got another message.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one came on Facebook and this one
came, I'm not going to say the dude's name
[SPEAKER_07]: because I don't know if people want their
names said.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent me a private message.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, listening to your latest podcast,
digging it as usual.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick heads up on your chloramine
question for a listener.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's for Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Seb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seb asked about the chloramine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was hard as shit to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chlorine is a gas that can be bubbled or
evaporated, but chloramine is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: No amount of bubbling will remove
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, its ability to stay in solution
is the reason water municipalities are
[SPEAKER_07]: switching to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: RO is the only thing that will work,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this guy knows what he's talking
about because he used the phrase stays in
[SPEAKER_07]: solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is definitely organic chemistry
major speak because we share a mutual
[SPEAKER_07]: friend who is an O chem major.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says shit like that to me all the
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that makes me think he knows what he's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seb, are you listening, my friend?
[SPEAKER_07]: Chloramine, the only way to get the
chloramine out of your water is a reverse
[SPEAKER_07]: osmosis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to have to purchase one of
those.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sell a cheap one, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sell a small model.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go to the hydro shop for an RO
machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to either like, we got a Walmart here
in the States.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you guys have in
Australia, but like a home, wherever you
[SPEAKER_03]: do like- You know, I'm betting for Seb the
internet's going to be his best bet on
[SPEAKER_03]: this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Seb, go to the internet,
my friend, and find yourself an affordable
[SPEAKER_07]: reverse osmosis machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need a lot of water,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I baked or could he just boil off and
collect?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if distilling water would
work because this guy here says that it
[SPEAKER_07]: will stay in solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how that's going to work
when you distill it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the chloramine is going to
move.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like seventh grade science,
but I'm pretty sure he just needs the
[SPEAKER_03]: evaporation attempts of water and
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you've got me imagining my buddy Seb
in Australia, just stilling a bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: water out in the bush, high as shit,
chasing an emu.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say, watch your back.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's wild animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's trying to fucking kill him.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, let's help this dude out.
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs a reverse osmosis machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bro, Seb, go get an RO machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you got to do, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go get the right equipment that's
important for the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want the water clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want the water pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go get that machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get that chloramine out of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to- He said, hope that helps and
keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that part of the little community
you've built.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the people that send in the messages
are great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally appreciate them because there'll
be some times when I'm not exactly sure
[SPEAKER_07]: what I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have a couple of ideas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got tons of notes written down for
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I ever run out of info, I'm just like,
oh, look, here's the notebook and there's
[SPEAKER_07]: tons of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when these guys send messages,
I'm like, oh, that's instant shit that I
[SPEAKER_07]: need to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys want to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just go and do some research if I
need to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the time I can spit it out off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that this guy just solved Seb's
problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to be a medium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what I did?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the chloramine message that I
wrote down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were talking about this a little bit
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just went and got my MMJ card,
my medical marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to rant for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Colorado, I don't think anywhere in the
United States is there a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: prescription other than the type that Irv
Rosenfeld has, which is a totally
[SPEAKER_07]: different thing than what's available to
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a medical marijuana card
here in Colorado, it is a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a recommendation from a doctor that
you use cannabis to alleviate your
[SPEAKER_07]: problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a prescription because they can't
prescribe it to you because there's
[SPEAKER_07]: nowhere to go get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking about getting my medical
marijuana recommendation renewed a few
[SPEAKER_07]: days ago, talking about when I got stuck
in the damn elevator.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a couple of people were like,
well, how do I get my card?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure that since you work at a
dispensary and you work at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys hear it at least once a week,
not as much, Mike, because this place is
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear about it constantly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's just do a little brief talk about
how you get your medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, you've got to be a Colorado
citizen and have some sort of proof of
[SPEAKER_07]: residency.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a Colorado ID or some sort of
bills that show that you're getting bills
[SPEAKER_07]: here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: So your phone bills, water bill,
electricity bill, some kind of shit like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need some bills if you don't have the
proper ID, either need a proper ID or two
[SPEAKER_07]: things that will prove that you're now a
Colorado resident, like a pay stub and a
[SPEAKER_07]: bill or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where you got to start.
[SPEAKER_07]: Become a resident of Colorado,
get established here, get your shit
[SPEAKER_07]: together, have an address.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second thing, do you have,
this is what I used to say when I worked
[SPEAKER_07]: at a dispensary like 10 years ago and
people would be like, well, can I get a
[SPEAKER_07]: card?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say, do you have a qualified
condition that would justify the use of
[SPEAKER_07]: medical cannabis to improve the quality of
your life?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I used to ask people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have, there's a list on the
Colorado department of public health and
[SPEAKER_07]: environment, they have a list of
qualifying conditions on there of things
[SPEAKER_07]: that qualify.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Severe pain is a qualifying condition,
and I'm sure that something hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's seven or nine listed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have one, but you've got
chronic pain of some sort, getting a car
[SPEAKER_03]: just involves two appointments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just have a reason why it hurts and
have something that hurts and stick with
[SPEAKER_07]: it and know when it happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can have some paperwork on it,
that's way even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even really two appointments,
one appointment and one trip to the post
[SPEAKER_03]: office if you go to a- All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mike's jumping ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike's getting extra credit.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this shit's easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have a condition, figure out what your
condition is, figure out what hurts,
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out how you qualify.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you call.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking like the Colorado Springs
independent.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Denver, look in the westward.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Pueblo, do we have the poll?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's somewhere that you can
look for a medical marijuana doctor in
[SPEAKER_07]: your region.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Colorado or if you're in a
state that supports medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a way to find the doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Google medical marijuana doctor,
your state or medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_07]: your zip code.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find them or ask one of your
friends that has a medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_07]: where their doctor is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my MMJ doc.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say his name because he's
overbooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got to go see your doctor
anyway, they're a doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 900 doctors in the state of sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not exactly hard to find.
[SPEAKER_07]: I realized this is why I looked up the
other day in the office in my doc's thing
[SPEAKER_07]: that he's a medical examiner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean he's the coroner?
[SPEAKER_07]: It means he can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember how it was in the
beginning though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were like three doctors and they all
had like a six month waiting time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that crazy guy that used to come
to our dispensary and give cards?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, back in the day, you could go into
the dispensary and there would be a doctor
[SPEAKER_07]: in there that would write your
recommendation and you could shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time that doctor got done filling
out your name, you were already picking on
[SPEAKER_07]: him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. J was insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you go to the doctor, figure out
your condition, send an appointment,
[SPEAKER_07]: find one of these doctors, send an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have records if you really want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know what hurts and then know what to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like don't go in there when they're like,
so why do you need weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't like not having weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually sound professional.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go in there and be legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, our medical marijuana program
here in Colorado is under enough scrutiny
[SPEAKER_03]: and pressure and under fire in the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't manage to get through the
interview with the doctor without looking
[SPEAKER_03]: like a jackass and hurt the movement,
just stay home.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really not hard at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you're coming to be an
activist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked earlier Mike said, don't show up
with your weed cape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if your knee hurts, like if you can
elaborate on that for more than a minute
[SPEAKER_03]: or two using medical terminology because
you've seen other doctors because your
[SPEAKER_03]: knee hurts and they recommended other shit
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: For your knee hurting, getting a medical
marijuana card for your chronic knee pain
[SPEAKER_07]: will not be a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want an extended plant count,
you're going to need to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to have some sort of
crunching noises.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to show some kind of
scars or if you've got some paperwork that
[SPEAKER_07]: would really help.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can ask your doctor, would you be
willing to write an extended plant count
[SPEAKER_07]: for me?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he may ask you how many you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be prepared to pay for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The normal cost of a doctor should be
around a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: The basic cost to get your basic card
should be around a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to get an added fee of
probably another hundred dollars to get an
[SPEAKER_07]: elevated plant count, depending on how
high it is, there are some doctors that
[SPEAKER_07]: will go fairly high and they will charge
you up to four or $500.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a fucking lawyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my experience in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get one of those 99 plant counts.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a red flag for a person that is
fucking around and trying to beat the
[SPEAKER_07]: system and do something that they
shouldn't be doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of 500 count cards in
the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like eight of them and they're all
on a list and the MED's been to all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: addresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing with the 250 counts and
the 300 counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that's going to be gone in a year,
maybe two at the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because of one or two people
abusing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause one of the people with the 500 count
cards is making oil for kids and he gives
[SPEAKER_03]: it all away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not all gaming the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them, in fact, are following the
rules, but there's been one or two really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really obnoxious people that have really
pushed the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of that system is going to get
regulated away the next two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The caregiver is going to be a thing in
the past by 2020.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm glad you said caregiver just now
because that's part of the next step.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask the doc for an elevated plant count if
you desire, pay for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you're going to be asked at this
time, you're going to start signing a
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be asked to assign a
provider.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you plan on growing your own medicine,
you do not want to assign a provider.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are going to be a caregiver,
you cannot be a, have a provider,
[SPEAKER_07]: nor can you have a dispensary as your
provider.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to be a caregiver,
if you become a care, if you sign your
[SPEAKER_07]: rights to the plants, to a caregiver,
you have now waived your rights as a
[SPEAKER_07]: caregiver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a lot of words that I was trying
to get out properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So decide who you want to grow your
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a trusted friend, I have a couple
of people like Mike and our good buddy,
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am responsible for growing their
cannabis and keeping these guys medicated
[SPEAKER_07]: and feeling all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you know somebody that grows well
and you trust them, make an arrangement
[SPEAKER_07]: with them, make a relationship with them
and have an agreement to where the
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine comes and they're ready for it
and they've got it and you've got it and
[SPEAKER_07]: shit works.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then make them, you have to get papers
notarized.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll need a copy of their ID if you're
going to make them your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so the doctor will have everything
there you need other than your buddy's ID.
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be a notary there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll take care of all that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So assign a caregiver and then they're
going to give you a bunch of papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll need a money order.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the places will give you the
money order.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll have it there for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, just go to wherever, go to the
Western Union, Lofenjug, 7-Eleven,
[SPEAKER_07]: wherever sells a damn money order,
the post office, go get yourself a money
[SPEAKER_07]: order, King Supers, King Stupids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you need to mail that certified mail
to where you get the thing back when they
[SPEAKER_07]: get it so that you get the return receipt
so that you know that they have received
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you wait in the mail
[SPEAKER_07]: and they'll send it to you.
And then you wait in the mail and they'll
send it to you.
Then you wait in the mail and they'll send
it to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure I accepted fake paperwork
when I worked at that old dispensary
[SPEAKER_07]: because the paperwork changed so
frequently that they would show up with
[SPEAKER_07]: new stuff and I'd be like, it looks really
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's notarized.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so easy to verify now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you get a purple card with a barcode
on it and your name on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've changed it again, I heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard we're getting a new pool card.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting, because Lindsay would see
firsthand, she checks IDs and cards all
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still the purple cards, but actually
now for the certified mail stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a whole list of ones that are
voided and aren't real and all of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when someone comes in, there's just a
quick list you have to check.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of cards that have expired and been
voided.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, people who have stolen cards and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend, I'm not sure how much
detail I can go into.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend who is employed by a
dispensary and they caught somebody
[SPEAKER_07]: stealing, blatantly shoplifting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they saw the person do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They saw it on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went and checked the camera,
but while the person was still in the
[SPEAKER_07]: room, so if they had proof, they didn't
make a false accusation.
[SPEAKER_07]: They walked outside and they said,
Mr. customer, we've got you on camera
[SPEAKER_07]: stealing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we have our product back?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, I didn't steal shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, okay, have a good day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just let the customer leave and
they called the cops and the MED and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're like, Hey, revoke his card and
send police there to get our product back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they went and got the cops went and
got the product back and confiscated his
[SPEAKER_07]: MMJ card and the MED, or no, not the MED
because it's not immediate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Colorado department of public
health and environment discontinued his
[SPEAKER_07]: card.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they took his card from him and he
cannot renew.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't steal from a damn dispensary if
you are privileged enough to go in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, there's a reason dispensary
robberies are so infrequent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because everybody in Colorado has
seen the number of cameras that are
[SPEAKER_03]: required and it's seen the one or two
reports of the dude who does rob one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get arrested like an hour later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get seen from 17 different angles,
just walking in the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can zoom in on the camera and read the
VIN number and you'll meet you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a, yeah, you really can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can read the VIN number on,
on the inside of your car, on the dash
[SPEAKER_07]: tucked in that little gap.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can read that number with the cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear the security guard go, Nope,
that's a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's zooming in across.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the other side of the parking lot to
somebody who just fired something up in
[SPEAKER_03]: the driver's seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a contractor working on air
conditioners the other day in the building
[SPEAKER_07]: and at summertime students, summer
maintenance on the ACs and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he walked out to the, to the truck to
get a tool and put a cigarette in his
[SPEAKER_07]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go, bro, I can't have you smoking on
the property.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, none's going to see me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go, if you look around, there's
cameras on the outside of the building
[SPEAKER_07]: every eight feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he looked up and he was like,
yo, man, I'm pretty sure he might've had a
[SPEAKER_07]: cigarette while I was up working on the
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I could smell that shit when I was
inside the garage.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there aren't any cameras up there,
but he was up there smoking on the roof.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty damn sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's people like, I see people like trying
to put out blunts pulling in all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, Oh, remind me to tell you a
story off there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I want to, I'd have to
tell the new employees and remind every
[SPEAKER_03]: employee the first couple times that
they're working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just remember that you're always on
camera.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to pick your ass, like it's,
recorded in HD for prosperity for all
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the people are watching these cameras.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's not like nobody's watching these
cameras and oh, it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just there for show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're just there if something bad
happens, like people are always watching
[SPEAKER_09]: those cameras.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're always reviewing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have weird things happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our grow is not in the best part of town.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's at the end of a street where you
could do whatever you want, because
[SPEAKER_07]: honestly it's at the end of the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing else down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nobody travels that direction unless
they're coming to our grow to do some
[SPEAKER_07]: stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And oftentimes I'll find parts of the
gate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they'll have unscrewed all of the
bolts on the gate, but they use the types
[SPEAKER_07]: of bolts to where the nuts won't come off
the end of the bolt.
[SPEAKER_07]: They took the end of the bolt and
flattened it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like after it was so now you can only
unscrew it so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get that bracket really well
undone, but you can't get it off still.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're trying to get our gate open
because our gates barbed wire across three
[SPEAKER_07]: layers of barbed wire across the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't get in through that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're trying to just get it open and
shit like that happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every other day they threw carpets over
the barbed wire and climbed the fence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we had locked trash cans and they
climbed up on high shit and jumped like
[SPEAKER_07]: body slammed through the trash can lids to
get to our trash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there wasn't even anything good in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was actually an exploded bag of
compound putty that I'd thrown away.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whoever jumped in there that night was
covered in compound putty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause there's a footprint going to the
fucking street.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they had to climb back over that
gate and with their carpets and covered in
[SPEAKER_07]: compound putties and get in their car and
drive away.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got footage of all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time we see it, we've got a thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The camera lights up or the video lights
up red if there's no action on the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it lights up green dots every
time there's movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can just go scroll right to the
green and be like, Oh, look, there's that
[SPEAKER_07]: dipshit on camera one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a camera 16.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a camera eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just see them from all angles
doing stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people do see all of that footage that
happens.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if we're randomly looking for one
time we lost something in the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, where the fuck did it go?
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't find where something went.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just totally found where it started.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just watched it on the camera,
watched where it traveled through a couple
[SPEAKER_07]: of days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're like, Oh, it's up on this
top shelf where nobody can even see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's right up here and just went and
grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And who knows what other shit we may have
seen if we would have paid attention to
[SPEAKER_07]: that video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we were around like an entire day,
probably people scratching their balls,
[SPEAKER_07]: picking their noses, picking their asses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't people, somebody will walk out
to their car and notice it's been dinged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And five minutes later, they're on the
phone with PD like, yeah, my car was
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting my work parking lot today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the lights on video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's on everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just dispensaries guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's on camera now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're out there smoking, you're out
there doing whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be aware of your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there's people everywhere and they
don't all like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them do not like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people don't like falafel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, we didn't talk about that on
the air, but I parked somewhere and
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody accused me of consuming cannabis
while I was eating a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not illegal to have you can't do that
here and have lunch at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm eating a falafel.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want some you mad boo free the
falafel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Free the falafel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we've been going for like 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: People only like to listen to 36 minute
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why 36 minutes is the prime
number for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, they like it when we ramble hashtag.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, does, uh, do you guys have anything
you'd like to bring to the table for this
[SPEAKER_07]: fine podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, make sure you're registered to vote.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we covered that on the last one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, cover it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the listener's name.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should push pause, press pause and go
search through my Facebook messages.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a listener who mentioned
Gary Johnson in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And suddenly dude is getting popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do you, there are a lot of people that
are dissatisfied with the current
[SPEAKER_03]: candidates and Gary's getting a little bit
of traction.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he was on the Nerdist podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on one of the good ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went on Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_07]: That wouldn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should press pause and do some research
right now, but I should find the kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: listener who introduced us to Gary
Johnson.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I should go, I think it was Joe Rogan,
but Gary Johnson was on a podcast
[SPEAKER_07]: recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: He seemed to me, he didn't give politician
answers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be like, Hey, what's two plus two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wouldn't go, well, I really think
like 4.3 would look good.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would be like four, two and two is
four.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like he was straight up about shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I feel like politicians do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what's your favorite flavor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice cream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a politician's like, well,
I really feel like cake is the way to go
[SPEAKER_07]: in 2017.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, all right, motherfucker,
what's your favorite flavor ice cream?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you see pie has always been my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you get from most politicians
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big Gary Johnson fan and he's a very
much pro medical marijuana, pro marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization, um, pro ending the drug war.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't think he's a viable
candidate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of his money plans are a little
goofy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, I don't want to get into Gary
Johnson's economic plans.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the dude came out of nowhere and one
of our listeners kind of predicted that
[SPEAKER_07]: shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to our listener.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for paying attention for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for making me aware of the guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I, uh, the second time I heard about
him was on, I'm pretty sure it was the Joe
[SPEAKER_07]: Rogan experience podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Joe Rogan for doing that
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That dude's on like 800 and something
episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Him and Chris Hardwick are leading that
shit forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they started it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Corolla might get some credit for
starting it, but I don't know if he really
[SPEAKER_07]: started it, but I know Corolla is up there
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are some of the podcasting heroes,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to seeing what Gary
does with the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see what the rest of everything
does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and what the fuck is happening in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, Oh, we're going to legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then why are the fucking Royal
Canadian mounted police raiding
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries in Canada now that cannabis
is legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: People kind of jumped a gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really don't agree with what the
authorities did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but at the same time, if you didn't
see it come in, you're blind deaf and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're watching something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they've been saying for weeks that you
can't do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not legal yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules haven't been passed.
True.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't figured out zoning or hours
of operation or taxes or none of that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I mean, you're just slowing down
the movement by jumping, jumping the gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they've decided on the legal age
of 24 is what consumption age is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, there's, there's, I listened to a guy
with the Canadian podcast and I think he
[SPEAKER_07]: was saying that 24 is what they were
discussing last time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's a little old in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be closer to 18 in my opinion,
but 21 is cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have to go with 21.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a daughter who's creeping up on
18.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if she came up to me right now and
she's like, Hey dad, can I get a dad?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be like, well, you got to smoke some
flour first.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, like I'd probably,
if she wanted to sit down with us and
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke, I would not tell her no,
because I'd rather her sit down and puff
[SPEAKER_07]: with us than run off with their little
girlfriends and smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well here in Colorado, if, if you're under
like between 18 and 21 and have a medical
[SPEAKER_09]: condition, you can get a card,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: My daughter has no interest in smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just putting that out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: She thinks it smells stupid is what she
said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did this with my niece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to do it again with my nephew
and I've got a kid who's like almost one,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm going to be doing it again in a few
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like someone between 18 and 21 works
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I kind of like the idea of a much
safer, gentler and toxic and being legal
[SPEAKER_03]: before alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of like some training wheels
before you just push the little fucker
[SPEAKER_03]: down the hill on his bike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are you referring to your own kid as
that little fucker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so tired right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because he likes to cry when I sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, birth control people, it's a thing you
should practice with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left my kid, but wow, you really don't
want one of these when you're young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, get old first.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jeff said all the people that tune
out after half an hour tuned out
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this awesome thing for you guys who
stick around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's been quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to break her up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been really stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus she showed up with like five grams of
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like, who wants the dad?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything you'd like to talk about
on the show tonight?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to take a minute?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything you'd like to bring to
the table?
[SPEAKER_07]: We should, you and I should give a shout
out to hunt and Amy and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_07]: green and healthy wellness crew,
because, uh, I thought Amy put the party
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turns out Joe put the party together and
then hunts the boss.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to everybody that put the
party together for the green and healthy,
[SPEAKER_07]: healthy wellness crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first time I ever took dad's a
breezy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it was a good time dabbing with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The boss took us out to dinner afterward.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to go to the old rabbit hole and
get some good ass food.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once your food was delivered, you went
fucking silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was like, food shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some of the social media stuff from
this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't blame her for being baked and
tearing into food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we got, we got plenty baked.
[SPEAKER_07]: The boss showed up and passed out edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your edibles here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he looked at me and he's like,
here's lots of edibles for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, kind of fucked me up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, the rabbit hole was a good ass
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The boys ate, uh, well, not just the boys,
the boys and a young lady, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: because Amy was involved in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they ate a thing called the butcher's
block, which is pretty much a big slab of
[SPEAKER_07]: wood with, uh, one of every animal you can
imagine cooked beautifully.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a vegetarian and I was looking at it
like, that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like whoever did this is a fucking artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they did a really good job on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I'm not hateful to people who consume
meat because I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat your stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it, put it in your mouth, whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to eat any of that crap,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: But that stuff was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a cherry, what was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cherry braised.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, um, back ribs pork ribs or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, whatever it was, it looked,
it was picturesque.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's like some food network
shit right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for taking us out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks Joe and Amy for putting the party
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the name of the place where we
smoked abs?
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, studio a 64 shout out to that place
for letting us go in there and take some
[SPEAKER_07]: dabs is a cool atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like an old bar that they just
cleaned out and where there used to be
[SPEAKER_07]: beer bottles and other bongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there's been some fun reporting
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause isn't there another consumption
club?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's 64, then there's like a
different kind of store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another smoke shop or
smoke club.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there, there's store 64,
which is like a dispensary, which is
[SPEAKER_09]: across the street from green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be thinking of a shop or a smoke
club with a very similar name.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest with you, I only really go to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your outfit has either the acronym THC or
the amendment a 64 working with the title.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of shake my head and I look for the
next one on the block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be too big of a dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: To avoid the, I had a mediocre corporate
brain fart one day in business school and
[SPEAKER_03]: then open a dispensary places that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just laugh like 30 dispensary.

mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thursdays are our normal recording days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Ross De Seb, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: He told us straight up that we were,
we were a little mean to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been trying to be more positive.
[SPEAKER_06]: You and Seb were mean to each other?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and Derek said that you said that you
two were mean to each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys talk a lot of shit to each other
on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listen to the Colorado podcast and you
guys kind of razz each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just said you razz each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Down at the box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop being so damn mean to each other
boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should take some dabs and play
some video games.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's just how our friendship
kind of evolved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it was good to fuck with
Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a construction friendship.
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember, I mean, you were here around
that's kind of when- Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave you a shout out on the show one
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you to fucking get to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard that one actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we were literally working and he
walks in and it's like, Hey Derek,
[SPEAKER_06]: get to fucking work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you sensitive, bro?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you sensitive?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we might've, we might've picked that
scab that day though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I love Derek just simply for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that, what is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just cover the hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not worried about the hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quartz, you can burn it off
apparently.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another quartz banger over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another banger on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could shotgun this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's fill in the listeners on what
just happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: So dirty D took a dab, set the rig down
and just rested it gently up against
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse's, his tea bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's perfectly carved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he's got a carb.
[SPEAKER_06]: How'd it go down your throat?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that last sip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it smooth?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it went down like a wide mouth can
or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a shotgun keystone back in college,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That Bob Ross, that too, right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's going to, there's going to be
people tuning in like this dude shotgun a
[SPEAKER_06]: keystone before.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: My listeners don't know what the fuck is
going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they're old listeners,
they might, they might remember,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm chaos.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the girl from your heart meets a
trailer park police.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Summarize that very nicely there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam's going to hit the, uh, the hitman
Samson collab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to ask what this was the hit
man and Samson.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what color, I don't know what
color that pool is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure what color it's pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like minty green turquoise ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a green label green flame.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was the same one you've
always had.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see now it's a little clogged.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one's clogged up from the secret
session.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't did that one yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the secret session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Adam mill.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I could have been there next time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put yourself on the list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send an email, pay some process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just honestly, I don't think any of us
knew it was happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, look at me live.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the secret session, we were like,
Oh, it's a secret.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, you know, we're kind of the
local Pueblo guys though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like you're, you're a little bit
more of the, the, the bigger mover and
[SPEAKER_06]: shaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're, we're down here down by the river.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, Adam's just lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just recognizable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I'm fucking six, five and have
dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Oh, it's that guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's my thighs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would, I would say you're two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell people that I don't tell people how
long they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell them how old they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, the day you posted on
Facebook, I was like, has he, they were
[SPEAKER_06]: like, how long are they?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like a child, bro.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're taller than some people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when you worked at the guitar
center, they were all like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're supporting the band down all the
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nipple lane fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to quit rocking the bandana cause it
was making my dreads grow funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I still do it occasionally,
but it was making the hair grow weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know all about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know, uh, Ryan C with dreadlocks?
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked with him this summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He put them in and we were working up in
slight, I put in phone lines and shit like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kept the entire summer,
like even when we were off working,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything kept it wrapped up in a bandana
and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays he's got they're freaking
massive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably wouldn't recognize them if I
saw them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they get so heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get so heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: His are thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, uh, uh, smokey, you know,
smokey.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a new smokey, but with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, then it's a different smokey,
but he is a younger Hispanic guy with a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of tattoos though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like having dreadlocks is like
having a child, but only attached to your
[SPEAKER_04]: head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you have to like take care of them
and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was born like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only a little bit of maintenance
to be done now that they're this long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get them tuned up by a friend of mine
about once a month.
[SPEAKER_07]: She does some work up on the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not much to be done past year.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing to work on.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I need.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need that hook, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The crochet hook love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get that crochet hook in there and
yeah, some interlocking and some pulling.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need someone to show fucking love
to this, you know, this monstrosity up
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I, I found a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, uh, then again, it's like,
I don't really want you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'll show them and they're
like, Oh no, honey, I'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inclusion zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you can't, you know,
like, just don't go over your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Google it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number of wooks here in town,
or I mean in Colorado, you'd think there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a, there'd be like, you were with me that
time, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure if you go to Facebook,
you could find somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like my, my friend doesn't really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to get them chicken wings that
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that white dude was like, the old
white ball dude was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife stood there and he's just sitting
there telling me how I should fix this and
[SPEAKER_06]: fix that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, this old 65 year old white
dude just sitting here telling me how to
[SPEAKER_06]: fix dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear it was me and you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going up there to get wings or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was, I've only ate up there
with the one with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys still addicted to street
tacos?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, very much so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody leaned into Mike's with
enthusiasm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I found, I found, I got this hand to
the chest motion and a peace sign up in
[SPEAKER_07]: the air for street tacos.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your favorite place here in town?
[SPEAKER_07]: Me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it fits with street tacos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make you some street tacos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm going to go get some vegan tacos,
I think the place is called Coquettes in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the vegan tacos or the
burrowing owl.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want some good vegan food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I've been with you trying to
order food.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Coquettes served like tofu.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all your normal taco fixings,
but then tofu that had been seasoned and
[SPEAKER_07]: done well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cool too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like some tofu.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the, the fucking mellow
mushroom, they replace all meat with a
[SPEAKER_07]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: That place is fucking so fire,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, that was probably the best
pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it wasn't cheap for my standards,
but I mean, it is in for, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I threw it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody at the table didn't go,
yeah, cause you're a cheap poor kid.
[SPEAKER_07]: About a mile away from the secret session,
there's a little pizza joint that I wish I
[SPEAKER_07]: could remember the fucking name of it
because it's pointless to just talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: it and not know the name.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's basically the size of the pizza
joint is the size of this whole recording
[SPEAKER_07]: area, like this little recording end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were playing like hardcore music,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, the dude was fucking real
distorted, but kind of slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dude was mad and screaming a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed this before hardcore music
and pizza places.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a relation.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had to work near that fucking hot ass
oven all day, it's all tatted up and
[SPEAKER_07]: sweaty and wearing a bandana and it's just
fucking Henry Rollins in the background.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a fucking dope pizza spot,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: This little place was pretty, pretty bad
ass, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pizza slices were two 50 for a slice of
cheese pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was added topping and like
certain toppings for certain prices and
[SPEAKER_07]: then your basic shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the slice of pizza was like a third or
a fucking eighth of the pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big ass fucking slice of pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for two 50 or three slices of pizza,
I couldn't even eat the fucking third one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the cheapest date I've ever
heard of.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, have you tried a Black Jack's tomato
and green chili?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's here in town.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I have a good friend that works
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to my friend at Black Jack
Pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got three or four friends that work
there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, same people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I also know the other, one of the
other delivery drivers there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we really talking about pizza?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got me started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the homie at Domino's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Bubba.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Colorado, that's what you got to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got one product, they got the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: They go well together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have totally paid for pizza with
cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Several times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have something lined up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for how long you've been ordering
the one place you go to all the time,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's been a couple of delivery
drivers throughout the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been to a pizza place that I can call
and tell them who I am and just be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: can I get that pizza?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, oh, yeah, we owe you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just show up with pizzas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't talk about all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say who.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I was discreet as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the one that way?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know which direction it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't look.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you from experience,
that usually means yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is the pizza is fucking free
and delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: The driver comes in and takes two fat dads
and sets down pizzas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hand him a couple of bucks as a kindness
tip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gets back in his car and he says,
text me later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Text me anytime, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever since the hash has gotten a whole lot
better, that helped the game too.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, holy shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually on my podcast, I can't take big
giant dabs because I get all dabbed out
[SPEAKER_07]: and can't talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's fucking four people here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to dab this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, dab that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to taste that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I meant, I'm going to dab all of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dab all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a taste of whatever that packet
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a big glove.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a taster.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're cutting into his big dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm cutting into his big dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a half a gram and now it's
only like 0.3.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just ruined everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to get high over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to do the play by play here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to cop on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a dab that's about the size of a
dime, like a little dime micro patty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, shout out to Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: He kind of looks like Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's about to smoke you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seb, you need to come to the States,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come visit us.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we need to go to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You three.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a postcard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything in Australia wants to kill you
except Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that might be worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn your mic towards you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a problem with not talking into the
mic directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's getting good at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think his first podcast appearance was
probably my show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, almost definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't speak much and when he did,
he said, um, a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now he has a conversation with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listen to your guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: To the Colorado podcast and he can do a
show now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We listen to yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually do have real life listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I listen and I tell people to
listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to all the listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to get pretty proud of the
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's getting going.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're taking your role as kind of a
leader.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to thank God.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to contain myself on this show and
not totally just take control and be the
[SPEAKER_07]: leader.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you heard our leader from the
beginning there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Adam's gonna lead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know we were fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely, I run everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just playing around seeing how it
was going to work out and it worked
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking beautifully.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, I'm Jesse Gross from the
Colorado podcast and I'm sure your mother
[SPEAKER_04]: is a wonderful lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a fat dive and give your mom a hug,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's going to think the show's over
if you say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's when you say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to take your thunder there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend who claims that they are
going to beat me to the intro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to memorize the whole thing and
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I'll let you do it if you
really want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint tried one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet that was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice how many times Clint's been back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching you do the intro is pretty
impressive actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: No paper now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just do it out of my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the sponsors fucking just kill it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No notes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do most of my podcasts have been
happening in two takes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do about 15 to 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to hit pause and take a break by
then and take a drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I'm doing it by myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to talk for a fucking 20 minutes
by myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this will probably be in the 130s,
the mid 130s.
[SPEAKER_07]: 134 is up.
[SPEAKER_07]: This actually in the recording,
this is labeled 135.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it goes 135 or 136 to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 52 weeks out of the year doing one
a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a Facebook memory the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just recorded my first podcast or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: My show's a little over two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in the middle of April,
I think it was two years around cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: cup time or not cannabis cup time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right before it or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you hit episode 50 right around
cannabis cup time, I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that would be about a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I would do two episodes a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to have that much content.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of in the beginning too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of like, Hey, I got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to come be on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were like, uh, it's like our
guest the other week when I brought fetus
[SPEAKER_06]: in, it was just like, he was my roommate
and he was just kind of hanging out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He literally sat down and just signed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a friend named fetus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see how he literally like signaled
the airplane to land on the deck and then
[SPEAKER_06]: said, hold on one minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a name, a friend named fetus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's, he's a little young.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, he's like, it's like a baby
type deal, you know, like he's,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's 18, but he's like, he's like an
adopted kid that is allowed to hang,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that every group needs a fetus.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nickname comes from an incident with
some acid and maybe a position.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I left the house, I literally
dabbed him out so much that he's sitting
[SPEAKER_06]: in front of a grow tent with it on like
bright as fuck with his hands on his,
[SPEAKER_06]: like his head or on his knees,
trying to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking six 30.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fucking 18 years old, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he, he just can't stay awake and
he'll fall asleep on the couch and just
[SPEAKER_06]: like curl up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just like, that's all the older
that kid is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's 18.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's my roommate.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's, he's nobody cares from your ear from
Wisconsin, bro or wherever the fuck Iowa
[SPEAKER_06]: and definitely not Cali.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm fucking K bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's definitely worse places to
be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to show you guys the, uh,
Mexifornia, uh, cartoon or Cali.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, whichever cartoon that I watch border
lands or border.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still, there's some in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened there, Susan?
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want to choke on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to leave it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff just dabbed Australia, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was definitely a point three or point
four.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to take dads.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you talk afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's more amazing to anyone at
the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we're all cigarette smokers and
we're like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was at a company meeting yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a peek into my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I was at a company meeting
yesterday at the, uh, the four 20 dab
[SPEAKER_07]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the real name.
[SPEAKER_07]: The four 20, I think it was the four 20
dab lounge golf courses are like to
[SPEAKER_05]: brunch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the boss handed me a thing of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, am I supposed to take a
glob out of it or just taste it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, go in the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause everybody needs to get some.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I took a big fat chunk and tastes
pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everybody watched me take like a
half gram dab.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's what our work meetings are
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we went to dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gave me an awesome business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just host.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm way too serious to be trying to just
way too busy to be trying to do anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to ask if I was like, am I supposed
to take like my kind of dab out of this or
[SPEAKER_07]: like your kind of dab out of this hash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause this ain't my hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we all seen that meme go around
here recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yes, I'm going to smoke all
your hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the person I thought of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I can take a big dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've literally heard you ask, Hey man,
can I get a big dab of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like piecing two pieces
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I like that half of that piece?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we just hit that with something and
whatever the biggest piece is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, and I've seen you take it and
they're like, they're sitting there with
[SPEAKER_06]: the job and go like, it's not bad,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at the, one of the cannabis cups and
I don't even remember which one it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was hard to find a place to smoke
at this, these older events.
[SPEAKER_07]: There weren't tables and shit like there
are now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I finally found a place and I'm
chilling out and this girl's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, can I join you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we let her fucking hang out with
us, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she threw down some hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: She goes, here, smoke this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I did, it was a good size chunk of
hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought she was kind of, kind of
challenging me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I picked it up and fucking dabbed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She goes, dude, that was for everybody to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: You threw it down and said, here's smoke
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what reminds me of a story about
everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Censored.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, look how grown up he's getting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we haven't, we happen to have
another podcast just for that kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: story.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sure do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can record that story right after this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone may have had something that goes
up a person's nose and they threw it all
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it all starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone misunderstood it and thought it
was for them and it was for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Florida problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done it with LSD as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hang onto this sweet tart.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was for four people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was going to be a fun night.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're supposed to portion it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may or may not remember April.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why you don't just hand people
drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we exactly portion it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just keep it for yourself and make it
last a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is funner to do with people?
[SPEAKER_06]: Incorrect, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incorrect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been day tripping by myself
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's me usually.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like three, four o'clock in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I want to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I definitely, especially here with
that sunset, dude, you cannot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just trip it in your car all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I live somewhere now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: He upgraded though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he's got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the Impala.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I get around.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can GPS track me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just happened to buy a car for cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from out of town.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if so, I'll jump it or throw it
off a cliff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is that fucking ankle away?
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much so that if they changed it from
one ankle to the other, the other today,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's still, there's still a mark in the
other side of my ankle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where it's been there for a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they first put it on, it was so tight
that it literally, like, you could see the
[SPEAKER_06]: little holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jesse might be passing out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's been dabbing more now too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That little couch is open over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's taking a nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking e-nails get me every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get mine kind of hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I like it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this e-nail you kept it,
you keep it a little hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last one you had, the little pyramid
one, you still got that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, fuck that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured you would try to fix it since
you have friends in places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's an OG fucking nail though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, Felice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a collector's paperweight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it blinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could just run the other one on the
floor and just have it up here blinking
[SPEAKER_06]: and people would never know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything fried out on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost went baboosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we can get LEDs super cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It quit blinking pretty quickly,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it started again though,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: One day it started and then it went out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a very good unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it was kind of first of its
kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Towards the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of a gift.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sell e-nails all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the company that gifted it to me
kind of went weird on me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just avoiding all that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went Mormon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were Canadian.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I had to pay taxes on it because it
got sent over the border.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like six months later, I get a bill from
the Canadian government or somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, what the fuck is this about?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, you owe us taxes for
some $400 gift that was sent to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's called spam, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you sent them $400, I swear to God
someone got you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted just the taxes on the $400 and
I tried to ignore it twice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the letters changed colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know you're related to Zimbabwe
and Prince too?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got two trunks just waiting for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when it got real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They went from white to yellow,
then pink.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like 16 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really care that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that American dollars or Canadian
dollars?
[SPEAKER_07]: American dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy, they got you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems weird that I was sending it to
Miami, but I mean, who knew?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a PO box in Peru.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prince of Canada, Peru.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some dude has just changed his name for
like two pesos and just slinging this shit
[SPEAKER_05]: all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the day and age we live in now to
where like your spam folder is not your
[SPEAKER_06]: friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just leave me hanging with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I laughed at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get so much spam in my email accounts
that like only my good shit shows or the
[SPEAKER_04]: good shit shows up at the spam account.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I get spam text messages.
[SPEAKER_07]: People trying to sell me Oakleys and shit
on my phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you apply for jobs, like do any of
like off third party sites like Craigslist
[SPEAKER_06]: or shit like that, it's all sketch.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll call you back and want you to like
dial star six seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I'm not dialing shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you apply for a job on a third
party website?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Craigslist is a normal place for
normal poor people, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I'm sorry, we all can't use.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you meant like application
services.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, you can find jobs and cheap
places to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a job through monster.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Internet is the day of the age.
[SPEAKER_04]: I misunderstood it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, let's keep it a little more positive
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For Rastaseb's sake at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: For Rastaseb's sake.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the most negative from your heart
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought this was going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is not fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the only one here having fun right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse, you had like 90 dabs broke up here
and there's like three left and we're all
[SPEAKER_06]: staring at it like the last pizza pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys take that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my own shatter here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you smoke some of those?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a couple of few dabs a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't trying to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I just heard one fly across the
floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saddle down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because it's shatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit pointing your fingers all over the
shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very, that was very, uh,
uh, dude, uh, I can't think of his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know who you think it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: The podcast Jew guy from fucking Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Joe Rogan from church.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you think it was Lee Cyan?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: The flying Jew.
[SPEAKER_07]: The flying Jew.
[SPEAKER_07]: The flying Jew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I watched.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that laugh that he does when he
gets all really high and he goes,
[SPEAKER_06]: eeeeeeee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, the one of him tripping on acid was
the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I needed to watch that then because
the one, them taking LSD on like the
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast and they're like, this podcast is
brought to you by fucking nature box.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, D are you qualified to use that
fucking?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like readjust his position like four
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how do I, my hands hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have done that for you if you
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been, I would have absolutely
been capable.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well then do your damn self then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's positivity for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff is out, put the microphone against
his forehead and yeah, see, this is the
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The video just would shine through,
you know, for these special episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Video.
[SPEAKER_07]: The show would be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's fair that some people
would be able to see it on video.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd abandon some people and we start
talking about video.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did it for YouTube for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like pictures and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got like episode 20 or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: That takes so much time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a really fast render
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does just be making the videos for damn
ever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For damn ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hellfire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hellfire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn nation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Took a long carnation time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had never started a Colorado dope
show without, if I had never been on your
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something I just wanted to bring
up tonight and some series on a serious
[SPEAKER_04]: note.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have one little subject I thought
we could do maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll blame part of my show on
like Tim Martin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Tim Martin.
[SPEAKER_07]: He took a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there needed to be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Tim Ryan Hacker.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Doe radio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Martin, JDR.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm poking again.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of Danny Danko's show kind of
inspired this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Adam Dunn show, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then Adam Hill for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never listened to that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: The fade out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That mic control.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the survivalist show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: What other podcasts do you listen to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course everyone at the table listens to
fucking Joe Rogan, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I listen to Joey Coco Diaz more than Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because Joe Rogan, it seems like he
has three of them a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bro, how the fuck do you do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I drive an hour or two and then I
work in a grow where I stick one ear
[SPEAKER_07]: button, one ear and just go to fucking
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of unpopular opinion?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I should listen to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Word.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from cracked.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you ever heard of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Doug Stanhope's podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironically, they just sit around and get
drunk and take Adderall and talk shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard about that before.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Doug Stanhope shot clogged
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the guy's name that does that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm too high.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I mean, when you forget,
listen to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'll know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a reminder of all of those podcasts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all like tear to him like what?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't remember the host.
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I going to listen to?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, wait, did I miss something bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I supposed to listen to this?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, listen to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we talking about this right now or are
we talking about this right now later?
[SPEAKER_07]: Future me bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Jeff, listen to the podcast called
this bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: This bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're fucking with our future selves now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go back to the future and not
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be sent back to stop Donald
Trump.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how that, yeah, I just rolled all that
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a three podcast and it really
brought up the 13 monkeys thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The 13 monkeys thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in 12 monkeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that really what it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only 12 monkeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: The head in the box, is that the,
that's that thing you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the movie?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you just go?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know this 13 monkeys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever seen 12 monkeys with Bruce
Willis?
No.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the movie I'm thinking of with the
fucking the head in the box, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a fucking number of monkeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like it could have been any.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost jumped out of his fucking chair
when I said Brad Pitt.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like three feet in the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like somebody related to me that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who put the fucking head in the box?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who gives a fuck about how many monkeys
you got?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't care how many boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just watch the movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll watch it tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: But is that weird that I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, Adam, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you just do?
[SPEAKER_06]: I dropped, I dropped butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe you knocked over a can of
butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody fucking relax.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are thousands of dollars in glass on
this table and you knocked over a can of
[SPEAKER_07]: butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hell fire, boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even break your butane.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just try to do an air horn?
[SPEAKER_07]: I need no air horn sign.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they used to have the no stairway
sign in the guitar store.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a no air horn sign?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have an air horn in my pocket
every time I come over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a little tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep making rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep breaking them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way the system works,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're not getting invited back.
[SPEAKER_11]: No?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, I love this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Adam, we're not taking you anywhere
with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why you can't take me anywhere
with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the prime example.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to walk out of here and both
of you are going to like whip off the
[SPEAKER_08]: belt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just fucking stupid dumb redneck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go home and think about what you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll save the beating for the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get it on tape.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's just end this one and start
back because it'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, now we're beating his ass in
the garage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff's got the mobile recording device
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we'll do video for that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're live on Periscope beating Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying I can take a punch.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, maybe not from one of you big
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Derek is about my size.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying he can't hit hard,
but yeah, you've got a broken hand,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you can't hit me hard with your left
hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hit you hard with my left hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm just saying I bet I could take
one of your lefts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, do you want to take one of my lefts?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know your past.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that Jeff wouldn't be just
as equal, but you know, at least he's
[SPEAKER_06]: skinny.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fucking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could probably just go, ugh,
like that whole one-inch punch to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a stout motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try not to piss you off at every point
in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, because I've seen you bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're who I call when I can't handle the
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, D.
[SPEAKER_06]: Positivity all the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've thrown him down.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of times, so I might be skinny.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, when he gets tired?
[SPEAKER_04]: What, when he gets tired?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to tell the story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, why don't you tell your side of the
story?
[SPEAKER_04]: The look on Jesse's face is totally
different than it was five minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, who's going down in the garage now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean- No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: He could probably pit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first rule of Fight Club is you don't
talk about Fight Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me, hit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, I'm not going to hit
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as soon as he hit me, then I could
have just fucking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I'm not stupid, but I did throw
you to the ground and I did pin you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat that, Rostaseb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fight, fight, fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kiss, kiss, kiss.
[SPEAKER_04]: My listeners are like, what happened to
Jeff's show?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got him tied up in the basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody loves each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I mean, it's like a brotherly
type love.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean- Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I totally had to throw one of my best
friends down in the snow and rub ice in
[SPEAKER_07]: his fucking face.
[SPEAKER_06]: That fucking gang of fools you hang out
with, I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have one dude that literally thinks
he's fucking coming into the room and
[SPEAKER_06]: jumping onto the top rope.
[SPEAKER_06]: At any time, shout out John Rando.
[SPEAKER_06]: For real, that dude is live and in charge
all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my trim dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: He trims fucking seven hours a day,
eight hours a day with me, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven hours a day and screams like I do
probably the other hour of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I chop down trees and bring them out to
the room and weigh them and then fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: hand them to Randall's.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then by the end of the day,
I got a pile of trim buds, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to that kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want more of those episodes of
them all just sitting around kicking it,
[SPEAKER_06]: singing like bullshit and- Oh,
with the Terpy boys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpy boys, Terpy boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do metric stuff every- Yeah,
I do metric all day long, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you think of their cute little
message the other day?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, metric went down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to talk about that on a normal
episode of my show, but this is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Metric went down for like fucking six
hours, dude, and you couldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't, yeah, you pretty much was
available on the retail end because I
[SPEAKER_07]: think they use MMJ menu on the retail end.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they could do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The retail worked fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: But any of the grow, we were packaging a
transfer and a large transfer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the middle of a hefty harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to talk about how much
we were packaging, but we were making lots
[SPEAKER_07]: of packages.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me and another dude fucking a
couple hours to put all these packages
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put all the packages together,
they're weighed, they're in bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the marker written on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go to do it in the computer and Metric
says, sorry, we're down.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't quote it with this, but it's
stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then it came back up the next day and
it's like, we've had our buds have been
[SPEAKER_07]: working.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been working our buds off to get
things back smoking again or something
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they tried to be cute about it and
they apologize, but they definitely tried
[SPEAKER_07]: to be witty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys get that wrote from a
dispensary out in P-Dub or what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just sounds something cliche like they
would do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to drop any names.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a screenshot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't send anyone there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a screenshot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just must find, whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, maybe I don't have a screenshot of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty sure I got a screenshot of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It rhymes with dong star.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was tagging plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cut that one out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't think I was ruining anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Torching it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what Adam does at our show also.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go ahead and hold that torch closer
to the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You told D.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to your face when you said
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to give Adam his own show.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to call it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called The Fuck Off.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fuck Off Hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think iTunes will leave it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Rambling Idiot.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we'll do it with Asterix.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rambling Idiot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crooked Trailer Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crooked Trailer Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: 44 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you call your hairstyle?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Molox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Molox Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Molox 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Molox 44.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dad rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the highly educated titanium
fucking nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: That thing is dish on top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baller, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing is so dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your dad's going to taste so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, quartz on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little dirty because I take glabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it needs a little heat to it,
but once you put some heat on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was just titanium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you heat it like titanium or do you
heat it like quartz?
[SPEAKER_07]: I heat them fairly the same with the torch
and pointed at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty simple there, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, when I asked this question earlier,
I got so much shit from everybody,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you see how these two assholes just
gave you shit and I said nothing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've already been down that road
and I was that asshole getting shit talked
[SPEAKER_06]: about, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't feel jealous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just jealousy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're trying to be a cool kid and it's
not fitting in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You even went and bought yourself a
grassroots hat.
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a couple for free, but yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I paid for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just put it on my check.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hat is the nicest part.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never even see the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, there's literally, you know,
I can't first rule by fight club.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your hat is like the nicest part of your
apparel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my shirt that I got for free from
Jesse, so I mean, shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Easy Clone, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Easy Clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking rocked the Easy Clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got an eight by four fucking table
filled with Easy Clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: That picture you showed me was monstrous.
[SPEAKER_07]: What picture?
[SPEAKER_07]: Those roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dem roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dem roots, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy Clone of roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy Clone of roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy Clone of roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get them.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of a rapid start.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of A and a little bit of B.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And an Easy Cloner.
[SPEAKER_07]: And an Easy Cloner.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I put an air pump in my Easy Clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a little air pump in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a little circulation going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get that turp going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more air, the better in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it frothy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing hits like there's no water in
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's so smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it's a dry hit, but there's
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because there's hardly any water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's literally right above the
second perk line.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've dabbed so hard that the water has
kind of...
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can see the old water line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it, Derek.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the only one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousands of dollars on... It's because of
my broken hand.
Wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget to torch off your plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a little lump of bottle on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to drip on your jeans if you do
it like that, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, drip it onto this Terpex packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your parchment's right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that big enough?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little dab left on it,
but Colorado problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm right over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're going to do this on podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you hear the smoke detector...
Different name.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're the smoke detector, that's just
broken plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to melt it off there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, heat the shit out of it until it's
glowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess the Terpex containers would
be plastic, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to be vapor on there,
so it's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to drip it onto a zigzag,
bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically zigzags.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not zigzags.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're some other shitty papers that...
You're trying to pawn off on this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't trying to pawn off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave a couple of my friends samples of
some papers that someone pawned off on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to be nice and see what
you thought about them because I have...
[SPEAKER_06]: At least... Hey, I like the packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't look because you didn't give a
fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: There could be a higher quality picture on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, but I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: When do you get papers with... It's like
listening to Mandarin or fucking... I was
[SPEAKER_07]: just going to ask, how much fucking
monster energy drink did you drink today?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like being around my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to hang out with these two fucks is
one thing together, but then you're always
[SPEAKER_06]: so busy now that... Eventually?
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, does he just sound like
banjoes when he talks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's literally walked in and out of the
room and I just kept walking and talking
[SPEAKER_06]: and so have you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be talking and he'll be saying
something and suddenly it's your... I
[SPEAKER_07]: mean...
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to figure out his different pitches
and tones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a whale, asshole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just put him in a mix and just play music
underneath him.
[SPEAKER_07]: What key you rambling in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that'd be funnier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Than you guys doing a rap song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw you guys, I'm going... Dude,
you can absolutely... I'll give you
[SPEAKER_06]: everything you need and Derrick Kane like,
hello, stay a while, I'll listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you exactly what you need,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just you got to let me know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's scary when Adam tells you I'll give
you exactly what you need.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All over the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.
Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody... It was funny the other week,
Jesse was saying something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was giving somebody shit like,
oh, you don't need to say that on blah,
[SPEAKER_06]: blah, blah, blah, social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: My nickname is 44, I don't give a zero
fucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, oh, you talk all this big
shit online.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jesse chimes in with, no, that's
really him.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wouldn't give two fucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not a troll.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's telling you exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: He kind of is a troll, but not just a
troll.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the one that lives under the bridge,
not on the internet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that sound for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that my ego defying?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a secret behind what you said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's a secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it a troll secret?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I mean, if I had a troll secret,
I would probably come to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been known to piss quite a few
people off.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the best ones ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to shoot myself in the foot
on that, but I'll tell you later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on another podcast and you
alluded to the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it again, my friend, because we
already done crossed over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just saying, it's good.
It's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Jesse pulled the mic out of the mic
stand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to get him to mosh?
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that how a rapper holds a microphone
down?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's two rigs Jesse right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now fuck that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely not how we do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing Zach Davis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not a trap artist either though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trapping.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could introduce you to one of those if
you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying, if you need fresh hot beats,
I could.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds dirtier than it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got these fresh hot beats.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the demon hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save a tree, kill a trap artist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure why trap artists and trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does that matter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kill a trap artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save a puppy, kill a trap artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us how you feel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse doesn't like trap music.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did your headphones cut out because you're
wiggling them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do a shout out to this piece of
equipment every occasion on my show.
[SPEAKER_07]: The LiveWire Solutions HA04 four channel
stereo headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_07]: That thing sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't ever buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is cutting out sometimes, but if you
pull on the wire, then I put my phone on
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the connection up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's this connection right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that thing sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the things that me and Jesse
literally sat down at the table and we
[SPEAKER_06]: both kind of looked at it and said,
you're still using that piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been part of that conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if I go to guitar center and I
tell them this sucks, they go,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, we know, here's another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The upgraded model is the same thing just
with like a fancy plastic housing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fixing a solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got bigger problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a four way splitter, but it's all
molded together.
[SPEAKER_04]: No independent channels.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the independent channels because I
like to crank mine up when I do my show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it up real loud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, who's phone is making that
shit go weird?
[SPEAKER_06]: My phone's up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's about to get a text message or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all digging.
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked up across the room and everyone
's got cracked screens.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to get mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did crack a screen like a month ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was like a hundred and two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that sticker on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, this phone goes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sticker is so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you know, you know what this
sticker does?
[SPEAKER_06]: Prevent people from stealing my phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of days ago, my phone started
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had to go to the Apple store and
they charged me 200 bucks to replace my
[SPEAKER_07]: phone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they wanted a whole bunch more money.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was like, I just got the phone,
the screen replaced.
[SPEAKER_07]: So can I get some, some love?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They charged me 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's some love, you should suck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's Apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fucking close today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I try not to have my phone out when I'm
near reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I've got three, 300 res.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three, 300 gallon ress in a room lined up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've got two, 55 gallon trash
cans on wheels.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're usually filled with water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've got another res in another
room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try not to have that fucking phone on me
too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a mop bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about you D?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you got to work to worry
about losing your phone in or probably
[SPEAKER_06]: some, some soups.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I got a hot wheels at work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know where we put the food in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a mop bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about my, or the toilet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever deep fry a phone on accident?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been worried about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the story I want to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let's Google it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's a YouTube video
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would suck cleaning that fucking
fryer out after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if it didn't, you didn't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Oh, no, I'm sure whoever we find,
it's got like some clear fryer that we can
[SPEAKER_07]: see through and they're like, here it
goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a camera in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, cell phone ruptures in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is this breaded or unbreaded?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can dip it in some fucking breading.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buffalo iPhone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be a nice revenge kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever get sponsored by iPhone?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to sponsor my podcast,
Apple, Apple, Apple, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Colorado podcast 420 at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got enough sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us have just one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a Mac book over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got an Apple PC.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got three iPhones in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just get a thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just send us, we need a Mac book for Dee
to do recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need another Mac book for me because
this one's filled with photography and
[SPEAKER_07]: other nonsense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need one to dedicate to the show and one
that I could Google with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna need to research one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse needs one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam, can you use one in your car?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a PC kind of guy, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need the new iPad.
[SPEAKER_07]: That might put me above my tax bracket.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need one of those new iPads,
that iPad Pro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could go ahead and send me one of
those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would use that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would definitely get shout outs all
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snapchat, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the garden would be phenomenal with
that new iPad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could do metric from the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't have to go use the main
computer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do metric from an iPad.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd help out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just walk around and do your plants
right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just carry it with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be so much easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to have the Mac book or something
in the fucking grow with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like you need to invest in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So come on guys, go ahead and eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, Apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be starting him a Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you trying to buy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like an $800 iPad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably know 800 people.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you could put a jar on the table and
be like, this way you could watch me at
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say we don't hang out enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll periscope all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, there's thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going through this every time I
drop something I'm buying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it has a crack screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they even harvested yet?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would they?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, shut up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave them shit when I first got here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, so what's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: So and so, and he's like, oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's such a vague conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very vague.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very vague for the listeners,
not vague for him because we had this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse looks just as vague as him.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chick that worked at the shop for the
wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, stop.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't say anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did that on a couple episodes back.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was totally a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to be like, shut the fuck up
already, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a big look doesn't mean shut the
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was like two shows ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, you look at me and you go,
you've already said far too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to point over my shoulder to
show Derek where to piss and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to see it's right behind me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pissed right on Jeff, right on the back of
his chair.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said right behind you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tucking right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't mind me, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear it on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're quiet enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch if we're quiet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me set my mic up just right for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can set this up so we can hear him.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pee louder.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the water?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not gonna be able to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was funny though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a valiant effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you credit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably the weirdest thing I've
ever done on your show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't even from me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the show of many firsts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, this is excellent though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a good time and I'm high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse's intro is the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just kind of testing the waters and
I was like, well that's going.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way I'm fucking editing that
out of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear us come back from breaking a
couple of weeks ago when he thought he was
[SPEAKER_05]: like answering the phone and he was like,
hello?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, yo, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes, hello?
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the people that are listening on my
feed, where can the people listen to your
[SPEAKER_07]: guys' show?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on SoundCloud at Colorado podcast at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can also find them on our
website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find them on our website at colorado.com
or well coloradopodcast.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez.

[SPEAKER_06]: And P louder next time, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're turning the mic up your P. We were
trying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where can our guys find yours?
[SPEAKER_07]: They can find, my show is available on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get your show on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to help you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've even got an RSS feed now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The IT guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: The IT guys just fucking.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Put this shit up on iTunes, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, we've kind of been waiting

[SPEAKER_07]: Put it on iTunes, put it on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_07]: My show is available on my website,
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my show is available every Wednesday
at one o'clock on Tocqueville.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to check that out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't even ever heard about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a go to tocqueradio.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can listen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a live feed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just always streaming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes Jay jumps in and does live
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll just play music based on his,
his vibe of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're a busy guy now, but is
there, are you still doing genetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just, I didn't know if you wanted
to plug that too for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't have anything available at
the time, but I'm making a rise F twos,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I'll be, I'll have my testers bust
through a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I may put some of those out to
the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely like Arise a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a really good cut of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like our number three or number
five or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arise number one is the one you're
thinking of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arise number five was really good too,
but I bet you're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was number one that we kept
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, that was some of the early
stuff you had.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got an amazing boy of that,
that cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've got girls of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm going to put like several
females in a room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably like somewhere between 16 and 20
girls.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that Arise male in a room,
two of the Arise the same male,
[SPEAKER_07]: but two clones of it in the same room and
grow them out and fucking hit that pollen
[SPEAKER_07]: on all those plants and make like between
15 and 20 new crosses and test them all
[SPEAKER_07]: out and see what works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I think about that Arise number
one that we had, it's your male is the
[SPEAKER_04]: male counterpart to that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just big, tall, amazing buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the things we did out last
year, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first time we ran that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually that was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had the black cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I bred Arise, I really expected it to
take longer to finish flowering,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I get seven and a half to eight to
nine week phenotypes out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a golden goat a lot there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of golden goat dominant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think golden goat on
appearances.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of growers, if they didn't
know what it was, would think it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: longer flowering strain than it actually
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That trait actually comes from the Romulan
in it because Romulan is from Canada and
[SPEAKER_07]: those guys bred their shit to finish a
little earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they found the earlier finishing
sativas and went for that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we were talking to Christian the
other day on one of the forums or one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to learn something,
please check out the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Jesse is knowledgeable in there
because he's got the years underneath his
[SPEAKER_06]: belt and I'm learning as we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Jeff, you've definitely had the
experience for the indoor for years and
[SPEAKER_06]: years and years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a lot of practice lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go check out the Grow From Your Heart
podcast for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the two best growers in town are
sitting at the table right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the indoor dude and you're the
outdoor dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the way it's been on your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was going to ask a question for
somebody, you're the person I would call
[SPEAKER_06]: for indoor and you're the person I would
call for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to be a part of all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm really worthy of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know too many outdoor
growers either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everyone's an outdoor grower.
Apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant that in a good way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone can be an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sun will save your ass many a times,
won't it, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_06]: I only meant that slightly sarcastically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff watched my plants live and die,
and live and die, and live and die.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the first year I was here and I was
scrambling to ask you questions and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: telling him to ask you questions on shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what do I do about ants?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I know, I'll just cover it
in dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, dude, that was the worst thing I
ever did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I covered it in dirt at like 11 in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by two, they were like literally
floppy plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, you covered it with sand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like raw.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was no way for the water to get
through the sand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched some asshole cover it in like
fine particulate sand that he bought from
[SPEAKER_06]: a store.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was- I've seen people do that to
get rid of gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pain in the fucking ass,
but outdoors in a root-bound container
[SPEAKER_04]: that is so root-bound it's drying out
every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean- No, they were in earth pots,
but they were definitely drying out every
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were drying out every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, wake up and be like, I'd wake up at
10 o'clock and be like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would wake up at 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what I've done by 10 o'clock
in the morning?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are movement shakers and I work
at a pipe shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some glass all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just told me today, he's like,
man, you really need to try for your
[SPEAKER_06]: badge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'd love to, but I mean-
Forty-four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forty fucking four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I haven't had a felony in 10 years,
so- Yeah, well then you might be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: get a badge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and none of my charges until way,
way back when I was adjudicated as an
[SPEAKER_06]: adult have anything to do with any kind of
drugs or violence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pure dipshittery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pure, I'm a fucking dumb kid,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a dumb kid when I was 19.
[SPEAKER_06]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a fucking break.
[SPEAKER_04]: So dipshittery.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think your 19 year old self still shines
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I play a good fool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forty-four is actually 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that was true, but boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't be sitting here.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I sure wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned my lesson on them 20 year olds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I haven't, so- You ain't
even got a pretty mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we had that conversation
earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: This got really weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in my next episode, I'm going to
talk about how to take care of fungus
[SPEAKER_07]: gnats and like soil-borne pests and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my listeners sent an email,
so I'm glad that you said fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't use fucking sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked, but I think it caused more
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: It suffocates everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was on an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been growing in cocoa lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cocoa's rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cocoa is nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: 100% cocoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are things mixed into my cocoa
because that's what we purchased and we
[SPEAKER_07]: still have the shit and I mix it in just
because it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: But eventually it's straight up cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've mixed quite a bit of cocoa in the
things too, I believe along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what we did in the first run in cocoa
and then we were like, yeah, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we've had cocoa to mix,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a run at home in cocoa right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pure cocoa?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, two-per.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's got a little warm casting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what's in mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted you to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we both came to the same conclusion
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm running a Mills Pace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done table mills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just giving them two shits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Mills and OG BioWare.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says two is key badges.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I always give him shit when he comes
into the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the last one he said?
[SPEAKER_04]: OG BioWare?
[SPEAKER_04]: OG BioWare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to do that as a base
test.
[SPEAKER_04]: The OG BioWare crushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've been using it for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been using it since it was called
Caps Spin Officials actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you can order it from the dude on
the fucking roll it up, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that Overgrow?
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes back that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was on THC Farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, porn pages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way back in the day, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when he had to do shit on IRC?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember IRC, sadly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember IRC through Anarchy Online,
but that was my experience with IRC
[SPEAKER_06]: because I mean, I played Anarchy Online
for 12 years, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was years of my life that I wasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say my wife?
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that was so bad with him because he
goes to Benson and Benson's so on point
[SPEAKER_06]: with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, here, get a picture with me and
my wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, I'm giving
it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then my plan is I'm going to do another
run after it with the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to add tees to it once a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just see, you know, compare final
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a side-by-side comparison with
two different nutrient brands right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, now your shit's cutting out because I
touched it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I touch it again and fucking killed it
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wiggle it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_07]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I quit touching it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're running and we're going to retire
one brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what I'm allowed to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because some of it's like confidential,
but we're testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've talked about it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got veg bloom in one tank and we're
on week one, like three or what's the
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursdays we're four days in the plants
look fucking happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, we're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure I would see something by now
if they were not happy and they get fed,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're on a cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they get fed multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're getting plenty of opportunity
to show me if they're happy or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look really, really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been intrigued by the,
I mean, I'm an organic grower also because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've always been intrigued by the
simplicity of veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all, they send you like four powders
in one liquid and you weigh them out by
[SPEAKER_07]: the gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's so much per gallon,
so many grams per gallon.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just weigh it out on a scale and just
pour it in there and stir it real,
[SPEAKER_07]: real well and just let it go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just let the reservoirs, I put huge
pumps in the rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: They fucking spin real well and the
water's cycling in there all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you use RO water?
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, it's hard to produce that
much RO water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I fill you in on a little secret
there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Walmart has RO water for a $1.59 a gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go in there and fill up waters,
like gallon bottles, it's 89 cents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water station, you can get it for like
about 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just saying like Walmart's are
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm not trying to pitch
Walmart, but they have RO water,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is- 65 gallons this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cost alone out of our day is going to
be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you're doing it, you're- All
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I use a thousand gallons of water a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking for the listeners,
well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: A thousand gallons of water every other
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then- We're in the same- Get a
fucking budget plan with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have them just back the truck in and be
like- Just use water, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's- The reason we asked that is-
I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: VegBloom actually sent us a mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sent us a two-part mix that I use
half one and half the other, and it
[SPEAKER_07]: balances the pH and adjusts for my- Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tested the water and sent them some
water tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sent us a formula for design for our
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it changes across town.
[SPEAKER_07]: pH goes to 6.5 if I mix it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that's killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's Thursday, so the tank was
getting about halfway down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just threw the hose in there and
filled it up with water and let it spin at
[SPEAKER_07]: totally 6.5.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the tank was all the way to the top
and it's still at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, organic's great, but I mean- Yeah,
it took time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is sustainable too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're using one fucking product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, fucking boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four packages.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like our kind of style of
growing too, are very simple and
[SPEAKER_06]: simplistic and this is more.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the stuff grown at Green and
Healthy, I used six bottles total on the
[SPEAKER_07]: flowering cycle, like total.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's A, B, Cal, Mag.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have a big flood system,
right, that runs back and forth?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't want to give away your
secrets.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're tiered, right, is what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just tables at an angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flood tables at an angle with pots with
cocoa, essentially with a sprinkler in
[SPEAKER_06]: each pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it seemed like they were at an
angle, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gigantic version of my little
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, it looked good though, with all the
gavitas running and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys want to go see that,
go check out the Cc420 on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the Ccc420.

[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little carried away with the Insta
horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't thought of that name of that
show in a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's always there.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I give a shout out to my sponsor on
your guys' podcast?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we're heating up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam is heating up the quartz banger from
our good friends at Elevate Glass in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Colorado Springs and you're
looking, if you're in Pueblo and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for glass, if you're in Denver and
you're looking for glass, drive to
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful ladies, wonderful glass,
great friends, great prices.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 517 South Tejon in beautiful downtown
Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't park right in front of the place
where you got to fucking pay for parking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn left or turn right, and there's
fucking free parking just right up the
[SPEAKER_07]: street.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to pay for that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get these dope ass rigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope ass rigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, both of them have Colorado leafs
on them, and it's like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Their little logo is pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out my little dabber they gave me
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got the little Colorado flag in the
teardrop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I've been saying we need Colorado
stuff, like so heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys rep Colorado heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've sent people up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they're in the canapages.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would believe that, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's called ELEV8, so it's Elevate.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have another store called Higher
Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you break your rig, you can take it to
Higher Elevation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Elevation Masterpiece
Productions, and they will repair the rig
[SPEAKER_07]: for you at a very reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check them out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they got a website?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the web address.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have found them when I Googled them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the Elevate Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're on Instagram too, I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That Instagram post they did the other day
looking out the window was fucking dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Elevate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, it was just a picture
looking out the window.
[SPEAKER_07]: My phone was broken for a day and a half,
so Instagram got away from me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I realized how much Instagram and Facebook
I see because everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you see this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got an extra two hours worth of work
done that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Jeep in an older car.
[SPEAKER_07]: It only takes me three minutes to pee
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I have my iPhone, it takes me seven
or eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dangerous place to have your
iPhone out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what happens?
[SPEAKER_07]: I put it away, and then I go pull out the
iPhone and stand in the bathroom and just
[SPEAKER_07]: use it and check all the messages so that
nobody can see me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you go back to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see what you're doing now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn on the water like you're washing your
hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let that fucking water run and check your
Instagram for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, damn good well, you're Wookiee-assing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, bro, I got some hoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to clean the hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean the hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just not the feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: The feet are fucking filthy, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wash them before I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't climbing into my bed with Wookiee
feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: This ain't so much work anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like classy girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be the last person I'd be like,
yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You clean your feet, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to look at them?
[SPEAKER_06]: I even got clean toenails.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even going to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to insult you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to insult you, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I left my sandals on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take your shoes off in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept them on, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect him.
[SPEAKER_06]: You still leave these greasy footprints
across my carpet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Harry and the Hiddersons walk
through your fucking house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you walk through tar on the way in
here?
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dude that does the ankle monitor had
to touch them today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, dude, they don't smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just look like crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks literally like I've walked
through a cow field to get here,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, dude, you're lucky they
don't stink because I would have literally
[SPEAKER_06]: told you to go home and wash that shit and
then come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would have been like, dude,
I live across town, but please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you have a sink or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get down the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, living in a car life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam just hosing his feet off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even that, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm strictly Jesus with bowls by the
fucking door.
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to wash someone's feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you feel humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: The life of real life, we Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: The life of 43.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the pump that you would use?
[SPEAKER_07]: A penis pump?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it got stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one testicle stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not supposed to put your testicles
in there, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I got carried away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you know now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this after you were like, damn,
this really hurts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me read the instructions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just blew every listener's headphones
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job with that peeking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got a compressor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a compressor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It stopped it, but holy fucking wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have it hooked up for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not on Adam level, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But between GarageBand, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your thing, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know the pump you would use for a
water wand?
[SPEAKER_07]: You just throw it in a big container and
you just fucking push.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use those as stir pumps in a big 300
gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use one of those and then I put some
hose on it and then I run the hose to
[SPEAKER_07]: something and clamp the hose to something
so it stays in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could hear it slipping out like the hose
was creeping while it was pumping.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I ran to it to grab it and it came
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This hose shot water up my shorts,
up my balls.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, how did that even go there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, that was a little
undercarriage rinse.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fucking awkward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag Colorado problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Went up my shirt, got stuck in my shirt
for a brief second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to grab it and couldn't catch it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It slipped out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It went back up and hit me in the chin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got veg bloom up my nose.
[SPEAKER_07]: The water was coming out of my nose and
eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I could do was reach to find the plug
to turn off that fucking hose.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today I solved it by fucking drilling a
hole in the center.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause then wouldn't the res leak if I put
a hole in it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what I did was I took a cinder block
and I fucking zip tied the hose to a
[SPEAKER_07]: cinder block.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I'm going to do this
fucking Italian style.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: I just fucking tie a brick and drop in the
bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They looked at me funny when I went to
Lowe's and bought a bunch of zip ties and
[SPEAKER_07]: cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have been periscoping that shit the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this crazy bitch looking at me
like I just killed somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have, bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't cross the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get in the car?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was measuring cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, three should be enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this would like say,
keep a hose down to say if I really needed
[SPEAKER_06]: to keep it down?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was life imperative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be real vague as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it is Lowe's and you can't talk
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to be real vague.
[SPEAKER_07]: The old man at Lowe's asked me what I was
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, I needed some cinder blocks to
keep my hose underwater.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how long your episodes are,
but dang.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just having a break and some music.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's going to be long apparently.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to pee, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to pee?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a fucking podcaster
bladder?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting here with podcaster bladder,
still drinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got that Joe Rogan bladder, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever listen to Joe Rogan bladder?
[SPEAKER_06]: I went with you to see Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wouldn't let us up or order food or
drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was recording a fucking comedy special,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Jeff went by himself, he got first
class service.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he did get put in the front row.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, yeah, pretty girl,
but no, ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got put like middle row, like right
underneath the other, like it was right as
[SPEAKER_06]: the audience stepped up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was directly under the camera is how far
back it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: The very back camera was right above my
head.
[SPEAKER_07]: That cameraman had to view over my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Joe Rogan was telling jokes to that
camera and it looked like he was talking
[SPEAKER_07]: to me all night.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he did the vegan and the Grateful Dead
joke right at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like totally fucking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was pretty freaky.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I catch a lot of shit for that,
but that was well worth getting in trouble
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of those moments that like
he's going to say, fuck it and go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was worth it, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that was, that was a very memorable
experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you're a grown ass man and you can
get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that like years ago?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still getting shit for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to leave that alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, I have to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to learn how to catch and
release.
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got no game, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you need to, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alone too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife, my wife, not her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got four listeners left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've all checked the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was good to you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Invited that fucking redneck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you send me to hillbillies and drugs?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did I just decide to play with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I see why everybody plays with those
once they take them off their water
[SPEAKER_07]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen everybody else do it and
you're like, well, I want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play with my little water bottle
tag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my little, my little shower proof
cap from my inclusion zone unit down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like me and Buck, this is Buck Rogers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I tried to put it on my other ankle.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your probation officer's name?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a probation officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a bail officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your bail officer's name?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out, Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out, Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me come record another podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoop, whoop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for letting him come to my spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you tell him where the fuck I live?
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 100% GPS on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fictional characters, fictional
characters.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all made up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all fake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I'd go in there looking exactly like
I look like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, can you work where?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, a pipe shop, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sell people bongs, you know,
like, oh, strictly water pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like, dude, he gets it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got pulled over and I was like,
do you have any weed in the car?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so, yeah, they know what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they gave me my possession of
cannabis, they didn't take my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my first question in the court.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, excuse me, officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the day of question, did you collect
any evidence?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, no, no, your honor, I did not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, case closed then,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's literally exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody laughed in the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they played the video and it was
like, hey, your honor, I'm just a grown
[SPEAKER_06]: man living in the car, trying to keep my
pussy warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody laughed in the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, the fucking, the cops like just
fighting it, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could see it on his face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, he's not mad then, but he was mad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe the fucking cops showed up
to court.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I can't either.
[SPEAKER_04]: You must have made some kind of impression
on him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't have a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, dude, I'm the most compliant
stoner you're going to mess with.
[SPEAKER_06]: All night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, there's no excuse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm smoking in my car, but I live
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in pajama pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: My keys are back there in my real pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, bro, I got my cat in my lap and I'm
watching the star wars movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_05]: That might've been part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably why he showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to drop his name,
but he was the most racist person when he
[SPEAKER_06]: got back to his car and thought he was all
alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that dash, that, that chest camera
still rolling brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I literally had to tell your honor,
we can, we can skip the racism and get
[SPEAKER_06]: back to my case.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was, dude, it was brutal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, was he racist against you?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm white.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one, it's one.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was his name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Officer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just say it's what you do to a
joint, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: His name was officer cells officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how that's all fictional officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fictional officer pass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm retarded.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're looking at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not supposed to use the R word
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that, does that hurt people's
feelings?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's politically incorrect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, dude, it's a micro version.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look who you're using it towards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to go, yeah, yeah,
I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, that one's always kind of
bothered me a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a dude who does videos on YouTube
that uses that word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavily though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavily.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, do you know who it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you watch, you're probably
thinking of like walking dead stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a really big crew in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know exactly who.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hashtag YouTube growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all free.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, bro, if my phone wasn't such a
piece of shit, maybe once I get a better
[SPEAKER_06]: phone, I'd love to put your, like your
podcast on and our podcast on down at the
[SPEAKER_06]: shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing hash church because
it'll play on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have a computer down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do, but it has no sound and it
has no speakers and you need a password to
[SPEAKER_06]: put the speakers on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the password.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get told that there is no password.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're not in the club then.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not an admin.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can play it over the loudspeakers
through a phone because we have that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, that we can plug into the phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it, but my phone sucks cock sprint 3g,
just saying step it up to the game on
[SPEAKER_06]: blast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lasers fired.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to let him keep going with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, don't let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: My listeners have smashed their phones by
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've unsubscribed to my show because of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to, I'm going to try to get
Jesse and Derek to stick around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do another episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you, I told you, I was going to
give you shit earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: You sure I'm allowed here?
[SPEAKER_06]: You sure I was invited?
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of feel like it's just like,
so you guys still work with that fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: red net.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is exactly what I expected from this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no doubt that it would come to us
talking about taking shits and random
[SPEAKER_07]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know it was going to start with
us telling people to fuck their mom,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I mean, it was a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse tries to keep it like informational,
you know, like he tries to bring the
[SPEAKER_06]: information to the table, but I mean,
me and Derek pretty much ruined that at
[SPEAKER_06]: any point in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you know what,
Derek, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had, we, you know, we've,
we've done stuff with that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've just sat around and bullshit with
fools just been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, why aren't we recording
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like those memorable fucking
stories are going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I would love to just listen to
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I wish we had a private loop,
you know, where there was some kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: private kind of podcasts, you know,
thing that you could, you could do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay us $500 an episode and you get the
unfiltered version.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can totally make that stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado podcast.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just plugging all over your show,
huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your show too, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to get double penetrated
by our shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, people are getting DP,
not you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Derek stepped right up to the plate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's welcome here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take the mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not hating, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: My listeners have been assaulted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck reptiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Rasta Seb's still listening?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is definitely going to be like a
Thursday bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be a main Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had people might send me some funky ass
emails.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I'd love to hear your emails on
my show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, either, either show that you,
if you're hearing me on the, on my,
[SPEAKER_07]: on my feed, email me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's go from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're listening to me on the Colorado
podcast, do it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Email me grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you guys are thinking of this fucking
chaotic, random show here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a whole nother new kind of show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's definitely another podcast
here in the works.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wish we all had fucking seven hours
to record tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a decent name for that,
but I mean for your podcast too,
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought of one the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in this group right now is on
that, that I can own your domain name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've already been on that hype
for a few years, but Jesse just found that
[SPEAKER_05]: hype and he's like, dude, I can,
I can fuck with my friends pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: hardcore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still open.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wouldn't really call these people
friends, but your friends close and the
[SPEAKER_06]: other ones closer on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just hate, follow them on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make troll accounts and follow their
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too much work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even want to hear that from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put your phone down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on how committed you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're way too committed to the whole
trolling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on Snapchat, rub one out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't like do it with your own real
account, it's not really worth the effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, it's been an hour and 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: My listeners have shot themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're going to edit this.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm putting it up just like it is,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty high.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way it's going to go on ours in
one episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to cut it in two.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get it on the website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a special episode just for on the
website or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want me to edit it down to a solid
hour, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I could put it up on SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do it as two episodes in one week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just part one or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not argue about this while we're
wasting precious time.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, this is the end of
this part of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're listening on my feed,
I'm going to come back and talk in a
[SPEAKER_07]: minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: So listen to music on my feed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll probably do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah, I think we're just going to
record post-production.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to tell everybody to say
goodbye.
