sour best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also lemon tree northern lights on the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as lemons,
lemons and more lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that lemons and
lemons and lemons description.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super lemony, super terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It punches me right in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be great podcast concentrates
on the back of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it does contain 70.10% THC and non
detectable amounts of CBD.

[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the quickest way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get your email to the top of the pile
is through
[SPEAKER_00]: the email address at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: or to better open up your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are rarely discussed
in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe grab a plant from a tent at two or
three different stages of veg and show us
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as always, much love and respect and
thanks for making my growing better every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out from Mobius Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love hearing that I make your
growing better every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few things to make your garden more
simple, more enjoyable will go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kind of compliments recharge me and
make podcasting better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say it's like recharge for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is human recharge right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a little bit focused and talk
about the question at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is quite often overlooked and
it can be very beneficial if done
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly and timed perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start pruning kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a lot of commercial style grows and
I need fast heavy production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I find that too many leaves are
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are where the powdery mildew
develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are where the bugs hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are where the shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have excess leaves in the
grow, it is easier to avoid what is known
[SPEAKER_00]: as a microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a perfect environment in your
grow or your meters are hanging or the
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer is hanging or the humidity
meter, the hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain would not say that word or the
humidity, the hygrometer and the
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometers are hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a perfect environment right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about down in the canopy where
all those fucking leaves are where all
[SPEAKER_00]: that moisture is coming out of the plants
at different levels at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have fucking microclimates within
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take off all those leaves that
will help minimize microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of heavy pruning in veg and
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little tiny when the plant barely
starts growing those two little tiny shit
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I begin pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those come off immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I've got a good developed
plant, that bottom stuff starts coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about pruning in veg
strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just said, I start with those first
little shitty leaves that start those come
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will start getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning is kind of depends on the shape
and size and goal of your plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take off a little bit of stuff
to increase growth and also minimize
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in early veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the plant is growing, you're going
to get good growth at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom, you're going to get some
little weak shitty shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pinch those right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I plant the plant into my three
gallon pot, I kind of let it grow a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the bigger branches start to grow,
that is when I start to do pruning and
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the bottom branches and give them
an opportunity to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't look like they're going to
meet the top of the plant, the stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom gets taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the branches look like they will meet
the rest of the plant and be viable
[SPEAKER_00]: branches that will reach my scrog and turn
into useful buds in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I take all the crap at the bottom of
the branch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will have a long branch with nothing
on it except a couple of leaves at the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those leaves at the tip will turn into
buds once they're in the scrog and they go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take off all the little tiny sucker
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the branches and take off the
shoots and kind of clean up the messy part
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as it grows, we will do more
defoliation and manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, the plant will get topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a full lesson on
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do more lessons on this in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some things planned for you,
but we're going to focus on this while we
[SPEAKER_00]: are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will top the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I see what the plant does when it's
topped, I know how much I need to take off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I taking things off of the bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned this a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send that energy from the bottom
up to the top of the plant and get maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: growth from the top of the plant from
those big beefy branches up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to remove some leaves so that
I can get better light down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lower parts of the plant want light
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get better growth from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like I mentioned a moment ago,
we are mitigating problems, eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for problems by removing
some of these excess leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't as many places for bugs to
hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites can't hang out if you don't
have as many leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew doesn't have as many places
to happen if you don't have any leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things won't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have humidity issues if you
don't have as many leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we start doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have topped our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice little shape going on up
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it just is a little short sucker
growth and not a real branch, I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: use scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use my thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a little excessive
thumbnail and just pick that shit right
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't look like it's going to be
worth trimming in the future, pick it
[SPEAKER_00]: right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big long leaves that are
shadowing and shading that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: My rule of thumb is when the plant is in
its big veg pot, when it is established
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing and developed and it's
booming, I take off almost everything in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take off every leaf with a
purple petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just strategic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an easy way for me to train people
that work in a cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that purple petiole,
that leaf can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves, in my opinion, if the
petiole is turned purple, that leaf is big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be blocking something underneath
it and it can probably be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start doing that before I move the
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of a way to describe
how I'm opening up the plant and pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out all that shit in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've topped the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got four big tops by now,
at least two nice tops, at least four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a couple of under branches coming
up, some lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see where the light is hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the plant under the light and I look
to see how far down into the canopy that
[SPEAKER_00]: light goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can move a few leaves out of the way
to get that light down further into the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, that's exactly what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get that light into my plant
a little bit more to get that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated in light all the way to those
bottom bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I clean it up, take the leaves off the
top and I see how far down the light can
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the light will no longer penetrate
into that plant because there's a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: depth of how far the light will go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a certain depth on its own,
then it is blocked by shadows of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where it stops being
sufficient light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that plant isn't getting sufficient
light down at a certain level,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the sucker branches, all of the
developing potential bud sites there get
[SPEAKER_00]: removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that nothing's going to happen
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That area where there's no light is going
to get yellow shitty leaves, small
[SPEAKER_00]: spindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it larvae growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little fluffy shit that you don't
want to trim that always ends up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash pile that is like, I don't want to
trim that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may just turn it into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim that shit off now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut that shit off the bottoms of
the plants and early veg, it will send it
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the tops and you will have bigger
fatter beefier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not wasting time on that shit at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you're not dragging crap you
don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got good things in your bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to grow big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the veg part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that briefly because I do
intend in the future, like you requested,
[SPEAKER_00]: to drag a plant out of a grow room and put
it on a table and give you a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the podcast is not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more equipment coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things coming for this
podcast in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tease you but not give too much
shit away, but stay tuned because I am
[SPEAKER_00]: improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon deliveries are taking longer than
they should because of the COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some items are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like everybody on the fucking
planet decided to start a podcast this
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some equipment is harder to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are happening, but I promise you,
I assure you, there are improvements for
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This smile is not fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking excited for what's coming for
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more better visuals on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be plants pulled out of grows
and you will see things in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you and promise you that that is
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stick around for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, this is what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I have abandoned any of my
audio listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: What just happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: My audio just went weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure it's still good and
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, sorry, you guys had to edit a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying that I apologize if I have
abandoned any of my audio listeners by
[SPEAKER_00]: switching to a video format.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt there was more to offer with the
video format.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be able to show plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to show more visual
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening on Apple Podcasts,
Stitcher Radio, Spotify, any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast services that do not provide
video, I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to come check out the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the videos because I do promise
there is more cool shit coming up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'll be pulling plants out of
grow spaces, giving grow lessons with
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked a little bit about pruning and
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to move into the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in flower on day one,
I really strip those plants kind of hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost to where it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like, oh shit, I go medium
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I give them about two and a half,
three weeks and I do it again and I give
[SPEAKER_00]: them about two and a half, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's almost harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At harvest time, I strip the shit out of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that proper pruning and
defoliation can really increase the vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants, the speed of growth,
the structure of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is done strategically, it doesn't
stress the plants out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, it's hard to
send a guy in there to go defoliate that
[SPEAKER_00]: room a little bit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send the whole crew in and you go hit
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it defoliated at a level four today
by the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys go in there and they do the whole
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the whole room a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a few weeks later, we'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easier to send them in there that
way instead of just pulling a few leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there and here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go hit it on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it again about day 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it again about day 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll defoliate real hard before harvest
so we don't have all that fucking leaf in
[SPEAKER_00]: the harvest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered a basic veg pruning and
defoliation area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your idea is to take off anything that
will not be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do that, it's going to
be useful in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if you're going to run
sticks, if you're going to run just plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't topped, if you're topping the
plants, if you're running a scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a scrog, I usually
recommend multiple layers of scrog net and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything below that first layer of net
gets picked off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not a branch, you can tell the
difference between branches and shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not at least the size of a pen or
a pencil, it doesn't belong on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut that little wispy shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is when you start working on
popping and twisting to make those
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining branches a little more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, we're going to save that
for when we can grab a plant and pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the grow and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mobius, remind me to do this
lesson all over again when we've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: video set up improved, we got some table
space, we got some plants to play with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will get a video on a little bit of
pruning during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure to get this message
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also wanted to make sure to tease you a
little bit about the upcoming improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where are we going to go from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message comes from our friend
Kill and Kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, this is a kind of a recap of
a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I got four yellow pH pens with
four different readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were talking about that,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the equipment is not as reliable
as we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to use it against another pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, so I actually snagged a
blue lab, snagged a blue lab pen from work
[SPEAKER_00]: and all is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some quality equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We quit using those yellow pH pens and the
blue lab is reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that little check mark is not in place
on the screen, it needs to be calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrate that bad bitch at least once a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Store it in the proper solution and it
should last you a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Lemon Jeffrey makes a beautiful
short bushy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my third run and I love everything
about this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great update on the pH
pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have been listening to the
show, you remember what that is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure to get Kill and
Kind's message on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more stuff he sent to me in this
one and I will be in touch with you about
[SPEAKER_00]: the personal message included in this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make sure you check out your pH
meters, your pH pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they are calibrated and cleaned
and compare them to another meter because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you only have one, how do you know if
it's even right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to get some drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try the drops one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare the drops in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that reading to what your meter
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it is right because those drops,
they're always calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep moving because like I said a
moment ago, I am super rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next email comes from somebody who
does not want their name said,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I hope all is
well with you and the fam and the friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are great, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for checking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it says, call me fur free bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoners from the 70s may get the
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you were referring to the furry
freak brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've been paying attention to my older
stoner friends, I think that may be who
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, what's up fur free bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I first tried my hand at
cultivation back in the late 80s when
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow stores started popping up in
my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan stoners have always been able to
find ways to build up the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Michigan has a great group of
cannabis enthusiast cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to those guys out there
killing, guys and gals out there killing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, doing some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, needless to say though,
the latest gear was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information and education was not
yeah, we're still learning and evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were not what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, unfortunately, for me,
my employer instituted random drug testing
[SPEAKER_00]: at around the same time and I had to drop
out of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 25 years later, wow, our friend had to
drop out of the cannabis community to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: a job because the drug testing wasn't
going to allow him to stay employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he dropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now here we are 25 years later,
seeing retirement right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was time to get back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this a lot in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that all of the cannabis
consumers are young stoners, a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot of retired folks, a lot of
people in your situation who have just
[SPEAKER_00]: want, they've been unable to smoke for
years because of a job or
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it is time to just chill the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of them coming to get
some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep up with myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, luckily, talking to a coworker
helped, sorry, let me fix myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, talking to a coworker about it,
he tipped me off to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely the best grow advice I have
ever received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to your coworker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for introducing the show to our
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I learned something new from
almost every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read and listen to a lot of sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something catches my attention and
it wasn't said by you, I'll search your
[SPEAKER_00]: library to see if you've touched on the
subject 10 times out of 10 you have had
[SPEAKER_00]: you have and your recommendations have
been so spot on and you have helped me be
[SPEAKER_00]: a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I love knowing that I'm covering
the questions that you have questions come
[SPEAKER_00]: up and you go, I wonder if he's talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you search and I have that that really
makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes as a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pitching balls out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if anybody is even
swinging at him, but it feels like you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be hitting home runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes me feel good because
without feedback like this, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're getting any success if I'm doing
any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, because I do get plenty of
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this still it's good to know that I'm
putting out episodes that are serving a
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just talking and you guys are
going, okay, here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep up with myself again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I started small and cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened and learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I saw my results get better,
I started investing in better gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people say I want to grow
cannabis and they grow fucking they buy 20
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and a giant tent and too much shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the house can't even run the
electrical that they bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I started with deep water culture
under a cheap Amazon LED under the stairs
[SPEAKER_00]: and eight grows later I'm growing in cocoa
with a bedroom and a bloom room under HLG
[SPEAKER_00]: 550R specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, you were killing it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That under the stairs grow is how so many
people start to that space right under the
[SPEAKER_00]: stairs that diagonal angled space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people have a grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a grow there for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the club, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing it just like we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've only been able to enjoy the
fruits of my labor within the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks to you and your info about
storage, I've been able to sample my
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier results versus today's I can say I
came into this on the short bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm riding the big bus,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the big boy club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were never on that short bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got to start off somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part about starting off as kind
of a sub par grower is that you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking improve and improving encourage
you encourages you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see growth, you feel growth,
you want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys see the podcast getting
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's encouraging me to do better,
which is making the show better,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you guys send more messages,
which makes me want to do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of investment in time and
energy coming to this podcast very soon
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will see the fruits of your labor,
your encouragement, your Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions, the encouragement to me,
my new motivation that will all show real
[SPEAKER_00]: soon here on this show if it's not
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a big improvement coming soon
that I'm fucking excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will know when it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even need to announce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the big bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the big boy club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hanging out with us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always been invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made it to the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says grow in the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, I'm finally on the big bus now
growing the dank with much thanks to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just you putting in the work and the
effort for the plant and for the community
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are paying me back by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, I listened to you
in the DGC show when I'm gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if it was your recent
podcast or theirs, but the topic of pH
[SPEAKER_00]: meters came up and a lot of good messaging
came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is one suggestion and I've never
heard made that may be helpful or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: too anal about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may be a little bit too uptight
for some people, but this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: great advice for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is not for you, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is for you, you're going to find
it very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says when you're building your
calibration curve in your meter and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be using four, seven, and 10
standards and then using the seven
[SPEAKER_00]: standard as a check, or if you're just
dipping your meter in seven standard and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting the meter to read seven,
then your meter is not accurate for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just checking to one number,
it may not be calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says your calibration standard should
never be your check standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like having me count the money and
then me verifying the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have just took 20 out and said
that there's a hundred and there's only
[SPEAKER_00]: 80, but since I counted and verified,
it's counted and verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody double checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're calibrating with a seven
solution, you should have another seven
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to dip it in, to make sure that
it is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: First day with the new tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll learn how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on to say, if your calibration
curve is created with the standard that is
[SPEAKER_00]: compromised, let's say a seven standard
that for whatever reason has a true pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you check your meter with the same
seven standard, the meter will still say
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I just said,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you check that same meter with a
seven standard from another source,
[SPEAKER_00]: the meter may say anything but seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without that check from a second
source, let's say you'd be adjusting your
[SPEAKER_00]: nudes to say six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be actually adjusting to five or
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually curve errors aren't linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pH is like exponential as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you fuck up one, you only fuck up
five point one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fuck up two, you actually fuck
up five point one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fuck up three, you actually
fuck up five point five point two hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go ten, eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like ten, one thousand ten,
one hundred one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain the curve right now
because I didn't pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't study for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is basically exponential on the pH
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: One point one doesn't mean point one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One point one means one point ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one point two means one point two
hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really adds up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need to research that to give you
a better explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you got my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say I've been working
with pH meters for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though it doesn't happen a lot,
bad standards do happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, anything can be failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can fuck up anything in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping can be stored for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're only supposed to use that
stuff for up to 30 days after you open the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says if you want to extend the
life of or is it the life of your meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: store the probe in the proper storage
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another expense, but cheaper than
replacing meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people don't think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One small cost today can save you one
hundred dollars down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That storage solution is about twelve
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meter was one hundred and twenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the twelve dollar solution,
that's 10 percent of the cost of a new
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will make your meter last probably
three or four times as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saving a lot of money by
spending twelve bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are too damn cheap to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I use a pen style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three and one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have filled the cap with storage
solution and the cap and cap the meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just pour some solution in there
and then cap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what I'm doing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instruction book on mine says if I
keep the little pad inside of the lid wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will store it safely forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule of thumb is if it dries,
it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I also have two different EC
standards that I use in the same manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this wasn't too much of a who shot
John, but I've been I've seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: mismanagement of pH up close and it ain't
pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How frustrating is it to fucking think
that your pH is correct to think
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is right with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is wrong with these fucking plants
are turning yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look angry at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pH is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go and check your equipment
and your pH pen is way the fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been doing work to fix the
nutrients, to make things correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your tools were failing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that can really mess up a garden,
really piss you off, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can drive you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you sent this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, thank you for taking the
time to read this and helping us all
[SPEAKER_00]: become better growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for trusting me and thank you
for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thank you for contributing to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great message, a great update.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about pH pens for
several episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one was great to get on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it wraps up with by the way,
has anyone ever told you that your
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery is similar to Jim Rome with that
voice?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do a podcast radio show on any
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have said I sound like Jim
Rome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time since I've googled
the dude to see what he sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I saw it or heard it the
last time I googled, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you were comparing me to
Jim Rome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of shit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy that you think I could do a
podcast or radio show on any topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't give a shit about much else to
do a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we've got this passion for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be able to do a drum show,
but why do you what do you talk about when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to drums?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to play the damn things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says stay iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm not sure if I'm supposed to read
this part, but it says I lost my mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: stepmom within the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give them spiritual hugs,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big hug to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for contributing to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry I lost both of your moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need anything, give me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not say that you want your name
said, so I'm not going to read your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the show, you know who you are,
