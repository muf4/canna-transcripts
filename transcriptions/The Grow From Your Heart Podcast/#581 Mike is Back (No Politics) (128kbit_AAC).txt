[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're watching on YouTube,
you see that smiling face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome Mike back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are hanging out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you as freezing as I am?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cold fucking Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so cold out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to break it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked over at the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single digit madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was seven degrees last time I
looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just peeped the cameras before we
pressed record and you're gonna love this
[SPEAKER_00]: update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking snowing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got at least seven inches out there
in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be 10 or 12 inches by the time
we wake up this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got like 10 in my yard, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over a foot in a couple of spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to shovel it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm intimately familiar with that snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Tony posted a picture of a 16
ounce Mountain Dew bottle and he posted a
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline over the day of that bottle
getting filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the day, it wasn't
filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just stacked up along the side of
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 12 ounces deep by the time
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got pummeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't seen this much snow in Pueblo
since I moved here like a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, hey, we might get some snow
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was like, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the fucking snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we expect it on Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we say Halloween, we're gonna get
snow here where we live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just about a week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mother Nature for kicking
our ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys got your outdoor plants
down on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first thought is I know two
people that did an outdoor this year and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know they both got out of the ground this
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all in dry and clear already.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of outdoor grows down
this part of the state, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they got out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people growing from here to New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who had to cancel his
weekend plans to just harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got pummeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not expecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the grow from your weather
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk about how freaking
cold it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cold Colorado evening kind of set
the tone for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to set the tone is to
talk about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, what are you smoking on this
evening, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been enjoying some local flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shop in town that had some I
mentioned it the last time I was on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show some really good golden goat that I'm
enjoying some sensei star from that same
[SPEAKER_01]: shop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been impressive lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said so much on the last show that I
don't know if anybody remembers or cares
[SPEAKER_01]: about my herb recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find some good golden goat,
grab me some real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to move right on
forward about the last episode you were
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate the feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you smoking on these days,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good toss, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am smoking some sour best lemons live
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blend of sour best shit ever and
northern lemon tree northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, they describe the flavor
as lemons, lemons and even more lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking agree, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lemon tastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lemon herbs are my friend,
my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work with my got a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still I've got weird lingering
fucking fuzzies from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the years ago joke,
shout out in a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: But years ago, I had a brain injury,
some lingering effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, I've noticed the lemony
limonene type turps kind of correct some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the in my opinion, I don't know,
you may see differently on that from
[SPEAKER_00]: another perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like it kind of fixes my
glitches, my skips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if your brain is a fucking record,
I've got a little little skip somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally songs, it'll just it'll
just it'll just and you got to nudge the
[SPEAKER_00]: record player to get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the lemon a little it wipes
off the scratch on my CD or it fills in
[SPEAKER_00]: the scratch on my record or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes my my brain flow a little
more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My beats don't have that weird skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when you would download music
from limewire?
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally, fucking boom and chat
can't boom and chat and then occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of the song and fuck you
have a little seizure from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my brain does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, you'll hear the beat will be
smooth and then in the middle of the beat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get just this weird fucked up note
that doesn't belong there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes those notes go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemony turps makes that not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I'm headed with all that
bullshit rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your regular advisement to avoid head
injuries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's the first piece of
advice is don't banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: When at all possible, you should duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or don't be six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what some of us are just born to
smash our faces into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the moving object in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am to blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like something went nowhere and
hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The streetlight didn't dive in front of
your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fucking I was in a town,
an older part of town where there's a word
[SPEAKER_00]: that they used to describe the people,
the descendants from this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a derogatory term,
but they call themselves that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those people are very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smaller people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the houses here were built for those
shorter people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were five, nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think their doorways are six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through that doorway and cracked
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knocked myself out, fell down the stairs,
slid down the stairs while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up to my friends carrying me up the
stairs, wondering what the fuck had just
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six, five worth of human tunneling down
some stairs makes a racket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fucking internet connection.
They're all blood.
I'm not telling you.
You're not food.
You're a dog.
That's a dog.
That's just a dog.
Feeling like somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck out, anybody in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer just told me that my internet
connection is unstable, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if things go weird, I'm going to keep
recording as business as usual and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll keep rolling folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we lose you will, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of unstable shit in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This internet connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the player.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder with all the snow if we're going
to have any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a fun show already,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even to the Patreon shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the part where we give
shout outs to the members of the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 club who support the

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.

[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking spoil them little kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one of me and there's like
fucking how many of you over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is a lot more than enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's one of me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got another one, but she's not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 17 meter to deal with than the tiny
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait until like long paragraph
form explanations will fly with my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're five and two right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because I said so is as elaborate as
I can get without causing confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said that there was a 17 year
old female in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to clarify that that is my
daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded kind of creepy for a moment
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna step in.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 year old daughters are expensive,
but there's just one or her and me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like fucking the tribe that
you've got fucking there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say, no, that's $900.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your kids are like, but daddy,
why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow is their first real snow,
so we've been having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time for everything with that little
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The littlest one, the two year old first
real time in snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have gloves on for like five
minutes and then came in and we knew it
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to happen, but he lost his mind
when those poor little fingers started
[SPEAKER_01]: warming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what my afternoon was right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anybody that's got a kid knows how my
day went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fun and then they were wet and
then they were exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of dabs in a pot.
Oh my.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I did the remake of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast seems like the perfect way to
wrap up the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That picture of broccoli that you posted
was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the people falling along with my COVID
garden, the last thing we harvested was a
[SPEAKER_01]: stem of broccoli the size of my five year
old's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He carries it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like hidden behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, where's your boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just walking broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have fucking lived underneath it
if it were a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered the basics of the... We
talked about it being cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff's here, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sweat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more here than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to... It's got
a new office space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too cold to do anything today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got all this energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to Black Sale
Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith personally, I know it's a company,
but Keith is the person that did this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that stepped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes ago, I read an email from a
combat veteran who had some money for a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light and they were a little bit
short of a quality light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably could have gotten a decent
light for their money, but it's the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't fuck with decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fuck with high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was talking with my friend Keith on
the Embracing Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little hangout after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Embracing Organics and the
whole crew there, but Keith was on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were bullshitting a little bit and he's
like, Hey, did that veteran ever get a
[SPEAKER_00]: light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, we got a couple of
opportunities and a few options,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd love to hear what you've got to
say because I work with Black Sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run Black Sale lights in my... I've got
a flower space with Black Sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a veg space with Black Sale Canon
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me and he goes,
bro, I want to give that lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, bro, I want to give that
person, he didn't realize, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: that combat veteran is a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you people that were like,
shout out, bro, shout out ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we got to correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lady, a very nice lady too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken with them several times,
but Keith was like, I want to give that
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, here's the info,
be in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put them in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today Keith sent that person a grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a Canon on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to toot my own horn, but they're also
going to be growing some iry genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath that Canon LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get them set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stepped up, sent them a Canon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them keep the money that they had
in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that they had a little bit of
money for a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even ask for that funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they can get some change or some
soil or some newts or some power bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always more to be covered when it comes to
building a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith is also a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should remember the branch of military
he's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel disrespectful now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't stick in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this weird brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things go, some things don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one that didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I at least respect him and remember
that he's a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he realized it was a soldier,
he definitely felt some compassion and
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a soldier helping a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disabled person has been helped by a well,
a younger fucking person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith is a young, healthy dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really good to see something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got people helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast brought people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean we have to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other veterans out there that
need lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is terrible that we have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a veteran in desperate need of
a light, I know another person who has
[SPEAKER_00]: offered, there are several other people
who have offered lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got leftover lights laying around
that are still usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that you and I know very
well, who offered brand new grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get those to veterans that
need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that I have to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like you to kind of verify that
you're a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith knew how to do it because he said as
soon as he spoke to another veteran,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like if you don't know
calculus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something you can fake for more than
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when bros and I talk, we're a bro,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bro out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But veterans, I don't know, veteran lingo
and I couldn't catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to vet these vets a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're actually, because I hate
to say it, nowadays people are not
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fucking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole world's belt got tightened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's up in their scam game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, it could be someone in a
totally different country telling me that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's somebody that they're totally not
trying to get free shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible that the world is that way
that I even have to question somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a veteran, but we need to vet a
couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to find a couple of people
who are deserving and in need of some crow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and the people that have offered to
give out these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told you, we got the one taken care
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you guys are going to come
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool that I love that I can
have this pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was talk into the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people sent messages saying I
have got equipment for these veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that we can create that sort of a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who sent a comment or a message
or an email or any sort of feedback or
[SPEAKER_00]: reply to episode 579.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Mike did a very good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very well spoken, very well put
together the past two shows you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't have to agree with us 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are adult ways and non adult ways to
go about agreeing and not agreeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody who replied in an
adult manner if you agreed or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as far as I'm going to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to address anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we gave everybody a shout out that
deserves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always welcome back no matter what the
YouTube comments say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People suck on the internet sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't read the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: My skin is thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check them on YouTube because I'm the
host and producer of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some feedback, but I don't,
I try to avoid the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh bro, we're so blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's one of the reasons why I'm so
pumped that the community was able to help
[SPEAKER_01]: out the vet that that's been doing emails
with the show and get some lights out to a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's, it's so cool that we can give
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're so blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we live in the U S we're white males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no one's hunting us for sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like life is good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't have blood locks, I'd be,
yeah, the cops wouldn't even fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is herbs legal here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, life is good and we're fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to give back is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people being rude on the internet,
like, Oh, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I avoid most of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody say, I get better shade from my
toddler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked if I had noticed the
negative comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, the what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know, I know what content I'm
putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be a different person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a different show
because somebody says, here's showy socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I don't know how to,
like, get out of that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll do the other free cannabis
podcast out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we've given them an attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you did a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a shout out to
everybody who hangs out in the premieres.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the premieres of the show at
midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the show comes out on Monday
morning and Thursday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 12 o'clock Monday, 12 o'clock
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those premieres are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting more and more people in
there every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fun chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not comment a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lurking though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not commenting, I'm lurking,
watching the comments, watching you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funnest part is we do our chat there
on the premiere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I hung out last night and left
some comments and chatted with the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it ended, I was like,
well, now what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I clicked over to watch Eagle because
Eagle gardens was live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody from the chat just migrated
right over to Eagle and we all watched
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that's been on
Eagle lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not watching Eagle gardens,
the name of the show is fucking talking
[SPEAKER_00]: shit with Eagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time you're listening to
this, where you're watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude fucking doesn't log out of
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love him and respect him.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day he's going to need a fucking break
and I'm proud of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone the entire time of COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire time that the quarantine and
COVID situation has been happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has not missed a single night of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do at least an hour or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll have a guest on like you and I do,
and he'll interview the guest and then
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll wrap it up and it'd be like,
I'll be back in two minutes, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure he goes and takes a
piss and gets a drink and comes back and
[SPEAKER_00]: he does the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to talk about whatever,
go down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes until I fall asleep,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never am able to end that show because
they go forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Eagle for keeping us
entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody putting out all of
this amazing content.
[SPEAKER_00]: When quarantine happened, people got
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what we were going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Content providers have stepped the fuck
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a consumer being self-employed and I
basically live alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here by myself 90% of the time I'm
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Joey Diaz or Rogan in my ear,
but a lot of the time I got Eagle gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Fumador.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all those guys that are our local
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm watching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of cool friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of friends through it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just on both sides of the screen,
people that are on the shows, I'm friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: new friends with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family tree seeds, Cascadian grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made friends with those guys through these
kinds of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've become really close with them over
the COVID times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to- I've gotten to chat and
interact with a lot more viewers and
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stepped way up the last couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for reaching out everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we provide you guys content,
but you guys recharge us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that you guys are like nutrients and
recharge for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put these shows together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little tech issue fucking before
we recorded here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had me scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to figure it out and we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took us a few minutes to write a
podcast together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all just fucking press record and
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go to the internet.
Usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what show I'm on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shows we just fucking press go and
hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't even remember where the fuck I
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we've had a lot more interaction
time because of this COVID time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recharging us all the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that's been putting out great
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that join us in the premieres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was worried about the possible
depression with COVID times, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we didn't get a summer to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what recharge and then it got
dark and gloomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people, myself included,
I can get bummed out in these cold fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from California, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from sunshine and beaches and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's depressed or what,
but it's a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, people are basically complex house
plants with emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you need water and you need sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take one of those away,
the human ain't going to do so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opportunity for sunlight was about four
hours today and it was seven degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: during that window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was outside working a snow shovel during
that period, but my shit was on fire.
It was on fire.
It was on fire.
It was on fire.
It was on fire.
It was on fire.
It was on fire.
It was hot as hell.
It was hot as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was out on all of my, all of my
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was not awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have tipped you fat to shovel my
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the people making the content,
interacting, listening, participating,
[SPEAKER_00]: patrion-ing, uh, they are keeping myself
sane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my Instagram live audience helps keep
me sane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hung up an hour and several,
like an hour and a half today on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: live and that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's like social interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the best part is you don't have
to kick them out when you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be like, all right,
guys, I need to poop and get some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to leave now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, all right, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking they're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't fucking linger if they
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to kick any stone people
off the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too fucking high to drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm off on a ramble today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lemon dab got me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a fun podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really all of the interaction,
all that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's been a podcast filled with
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for almost 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really done a lot of cannabis
related content, but we need to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the last show that we did,
there's a couple people out there with
[SPEAKER_01]: their cheeks clenched wondering which
direction the show is going to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be rambles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to do cannabis stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Mike going to do another politics rant?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I may have lost a couple of
people because that last episode honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we lost the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing about people who jump off
the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clearly didn't want to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If y'all made it to 570 some episodes and
hadn't realized that I was a liberal's
[SPEAKER_01]: liberal liberal, y'all ain't been
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pull this one back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting into that water again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show has a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing politics tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a fun 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just enjoying the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Posted and then got back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the show has only been out for 12
hours at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours now while we're recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show has been out for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were seven comments before we
recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 200 and something emails when I woke
up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them were comments and emails
about the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that we're doing a bunch of
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't, we haven't done any cannabis
content, probably not going to do any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis content on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hang out and have a good
time because Mike and I wanted to catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike missed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Mike had some free time,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to give a giant shout out to
my friend Buzz bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Buzz bros on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like it sounds B-U-Z-B-R-O-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nice guy has rebuilt my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've complained about my website for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to have Colorado with the end of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to convert everything to the
new website iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about the build.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're putting, we're sprucing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The framework is in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a lot of work on that
over the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a three week deadline about two
weeks ago and he's already way ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pleased with what he's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scrolled through it for a couple of
moments here before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go looking for errors and things that we
need to correct and update when I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited with the way that
the website has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you were looking for
anything iregenetics related, sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about my genetics, where to buy the
genetics, where to buy t-shirts,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to join us on Patreon, how to listen
to the podcast, how to contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One location.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more of the scrambling around
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all in one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got connections wavering buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your voice just went all you walkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it is recording properly in one
of our devices, I've got two recording
[SPEAKER_00]: devices here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw your face, I definitely knew
the spot for an edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just have to double listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not even take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get to see that little behind the
scenes part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's snowing like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's six degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're liable to get some tech insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first time we tried one of
these Zoom podcasts, I called it a bunker
[SPEAKER_01]: session and it feels more and more like
that every time we do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got the technology figured out
mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I sound really good in
everybody's ears this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new piece of tech that should be
bringing my volume up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's snowing like a beast outside and we
can't do anything about the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having fun though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody that listens to the show
really likes the content we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your show's been crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grow episodes have been so good
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep teasing stuff that's coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a couple of hints of things that
may happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliments,
but I know we can do better and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk too much about it
here because I just want to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: things are in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Patreon, we'll see you at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for us to be podcasting from
the same space again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is something lost when I'm staring
at a screen with lights in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just that millisecond of social.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he done talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I talk now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I talk over him?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that one millisecond that we both
hesitate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot harder to do this over Zoom
than it is in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hanging out with you for a brief
moment the other day as you were headed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the dispensary, just seeing you for
that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human interaction was golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You forget what human interaction is like
during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the store clerk and the people
in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, someone's at the doorbell and
I didn't order Grubhub.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not bring you a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a human with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Conversation and Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to hang out with White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen you in a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, how you been, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's everything going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the wife?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that new house coming along well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just fucking excited, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to skip the odd social
engagement because I'd rather stay home
[SPEAKER_01]: and avoid people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, we've had enough of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invite me to a fucking mixer and we'll
chit chat for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm torn.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want me to go to events and people
are throwing events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, give me just a little bit
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how all this stuff plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a little bit, we'll go to
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fighting the urge to just try to chit
chat with people texting me random
[SPEAKER_01]: political stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote no on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, but how was your day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send me a message like, hey,
have you voted on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them my views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I asked them weird questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sending them quotes from some of my
favorite comedians and other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I decided that maybe some of the
things that we're saying might be lewd and
[SPEAKER_00]: could get me in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might not want to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sent a quote from one of my favorite
podcasts to one of the political whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they replied with another quote from
the same podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called the account on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to vote for you just because you
knew what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I had fun trolling was the,
we want to warranty your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fun with those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you really don't want to
warranty my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch, I'll tell you about it and watch
you hang up on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got me off their list quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a telemarketing firm for a
summer and they gave me Jedi training.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also stage presence and just so much time
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a musician for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the front man, but I was on the
stage singing or playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking at you and that
fucking, and then I worked, I've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: retail, but yeah, I've totally lost my
train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jump in with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you get, you get comfortable in
front of a camera in front of the talk and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing retail.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to come in and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you teach us a little bit about how
that felt?
Can we kind of wrap this up, man?
In line with something?
Yup.
Shoot.
Yeah.
That'd be a Sleepy.
Luckily that simplicity, that trust.
And last two weeks ago it was all of a
sudden the clock stopped.
Like, no, it was the first time ever in
like a last minute, when you're like,
Hey, f***, why am I doing this?
Am I yelling at you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Ek then Kb I checked in with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, am I going crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this sweater thing that I bought
this fucking it's all wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking for complete warm season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the heater on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm warm because of this fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought this in like March because I
couldn't tell what season or month it was
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got ripped off for a summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, we don't get to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like in the summer I go to a
concert and a comedy show every fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I roll comedy show concert
comedy concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought it was fall because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Found myself buying pants and sweaters and
things online when I was doing online
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that the winter is here,
I've got a whole new fucking fall winter
[SPEAKER_00]: outfit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I was just like you're
saying I didn't know what the fuck season
[SPEAKER_00]: or time of year it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that it's dark so early,
I really have no concept of fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I woke up at 630 in the morning and
looked at my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the clock and it said 630.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the sky and I was like,
AM or PM, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not even fucking sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had somebody asking me, it was basic
stuff about like how long my kids been
[SPEAKER_01]: back in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was completely unable to give them
an accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's been six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been nine months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just no concept of time anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would base my time off of events that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, it had to be in March because
we saw Bobby Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be on the way home from the
Brendan Schaub comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been none of that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gearing up for the holidays and
talking about like, well, we only want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have one or two people at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that person gets to come for this one,
but not that one, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an interesting winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for some.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: More content coming at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I'll be Ramblecast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have a couple of good emails
selected for this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do those next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are definitely going to come up in
another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have already happened in the
episode before this, just because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: magic of the way that podcasting and
editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be different, good emails for the
next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's how she go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked a couple, but I think we had so
much fun just hanging out that we may have
[SPEAKER_00]: forgotten that there was a job to do,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had too much fun in the break.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chatted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came, they saw, we went.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a COVID cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask us questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of baked, bro, let's wrap up this
podcast and take some freaking dabs.

Jeff?

how would I go?

that if this message garnishes,
