[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else do I have for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Portions of this podcast are brought to
you by Our Good Friends at Hemplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemplements, you guys, Hemplements are
bringing to you Hemp History Week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp History Week, June 6th through June
12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 11th annual Hemp History Week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp History Week began in 2009 when the
Hemp Industry Association and Vote Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: joined forces to raise support for
industrial hemp farming in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, the Industrial Hemp Farm Act was
introduced to clarify the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between cannabis and industrial hemp and
to repeal federal laws outlining the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp was illegal based on the ideals that
it is easily confused with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp does not contain THC,
the main psychoactive molecule in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp is a highly sustainable
crop that can be used to make products
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging from lip balm to hemp bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Hemp Hemplements in
Colorado Springs will be hosting events
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown which will feature classes on how
to make and use hemp fibers and
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions on the benefits of hemp and
CBD products for health and wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a variety of activities and
vendors on hand for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to learn
more about industrial hemp, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: check out Hemplements in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday will feature arts and crafts and
story time for children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also be having a barbecue
featuring hemp burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information, check out
Hemplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give them a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's area code 719-358-8667 or you can
check them out at 22 East Bijou in lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're down there, stop at Bambino's
and get yourself a pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big shout out to my friends in
the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listened to the last episode,
episode number 136, that was what I call a
[SPEAKER_00]: swap cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also known as a crossover episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my friends from the Colorado podcast
come by and they hung out for about two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and re-recorded a ridiculous
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jesse Gross, shout out to
Despicable D and also a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for coming and recording
this show and make sure you guys support
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't listened to that one yet,
make sure you go back and listen to 136.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all the ads and information
I have got to start the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about a message I received
from a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about wondering if CBD
derived from hemp is any good if it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as CBD derived from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was thinking that hemp derived CBD
would not have any medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD derived from hemp and CBD derived from
cannabis is the same CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pulling out the same CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference between hemp and
cannabis is the amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Colorado has set a threshold
of how much THC is allowed to be in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before they are considered hemp or
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I do not remember the exact
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 5% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 0.5% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhere between three and 5% THC to
the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got more than that, it is
considered cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got less than that, it is
considered a hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends over at Sansol, a giant hemp
farm here in Pueblo, Colorado produce
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amounts of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were confused, if you were thinking
that CBD derived from hemp versus CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from cannabis is a different
product, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the same molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have the same medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do the same thing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took what was considered a hemp
plant that was high in CBD and a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that was high in THC and you ran
them both through the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction method, whether it be BHO or
CO2, you would pull out very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: products, very similar concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hemp product is going to be very
high in CBD and it will not contain any
[SPEAKER_00]: THC or very, very trace amounts,
if any at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only difference is the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main difference of the source is
just the lack of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pressed pause and I did a little bit
of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state of Colorado, the difference
between hemp and cannabis, if a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: contains greater than 0.3% THC,
it is considered a cannabis plant and it
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot qualify to be on a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a threshold that is 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got more than 0.3, it cannot be
grown on a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be then grown in a medical
marijuana or a recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility that is regulated by
the MED, which is a totally different ball
[SPEAKER_00]: game than growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to produce large amounts of
CBD products now because we're using hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: farms to do so, which is making CBD
medicine available to many more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that clears that up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from another listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say, if you send me an
email and you want your name set on the
[SPEAKER_00]: air, include that in your email,
because I try to be respectful and not
[SPEAKER_00]: bust out people's names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get you in trouble by
saying your name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like me to say your name,
just let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
thanks for putting out such a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me the motivation to keep this
show coming at you every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of effort to do a weekly
podcast when you work as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these compliments and the words of
affirmation, is that what that's called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The compliments and words of affirmation
are definitely keeping me moving strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the email goes on to say,
I'm looking forward to your upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor show you mentioned is in the
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if you can discuss strains
that do particularly well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to get more outdoor episodes
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get Jesse here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is busy with his own podcast,
his own gardens, his own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Jesse's free, I will get him here
for more outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says, I'm growing an organ
outdoors again this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When researching strains online,
I couldn't find much information on which
[SPEAKER_00]: do better indoors and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up picking clones of Blue Dream,
Green Crack, Sunset Sherbet and Gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: Glue 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read that Blue Dream does
phenomenally outdoors, but couldn't find
[SPEAKER_00]: much on the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at past Emerald Cup winners to
see what has won there since those grows
[SPEAKER_00]: are outdoors, but I couldn't find many of
those strains locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in PM resistant strains as
well, since that's something we battle
[SPEAKER_00]: come fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the email, but I took a
screenshot and I didn't get the rest of it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you sending me that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few strains that I
think would do very well for you outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I could recommend almost
anything from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short's Flow and Blueberry do
wonderfully outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains are very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finish kind of early and they will
give you nice heavy harvests outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you want to keep in mind for an
outdoor garden is you need stuff that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to finish kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to take a super long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it done before the fall or
the winter comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe out there in Oregon, you have more
time than we do here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have maybe a little longer window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you might be able to get something
like some Sour Diesel or some Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains do very well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to stick with strains
that finish around 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: About eight weeks strains would be ideal
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like from my lineup,
I would recommend Capelton for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finishes on time and puts on nice
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loves the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow it in soil, add plenty of
kelp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make it taste nice and funky,
nice and earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capelton is very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it finished in time,
Golden Goat will take about 65 to 70 days
[SPEAKER_00]: to reach full maturity outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outdoor Golden Goat is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat loves that sunshine and it
will harvest super heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another strain I can recommend for great
outdoor growing is Old School Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu Kush finishes on time and it really
loves to be grown in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some wonderful Hindu Kush going
through our area a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he never had problems with mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs didn't like the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wonderful plant for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some great outdoor strains
that we can recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you've already chosen your
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blue Dream should do all right
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should produce really heavily if it
gets finished on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Crack, I don't have a lot of
experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sunset Sherbet, I don't have a lot of
experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue 4, that is a hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will grow like a beast outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything finishes up on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your outdoor harvest goes perfectly
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for the email and I hope we
answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, if I can pull it up on the phone
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from one of our friends on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I have a quick
question that I feel you can easily shed
[SPEAKER_00]: some light upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, words are hard today you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I've started my outdoor crop
early indoors under a 400 watt metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halide and July 1st is my outside plant
day and currently my plants are on a 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel I should 18 six to start
acclimating them to get ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on this subject?
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerely, a long time podcast listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs with his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, I don't know if you want me to
say your name, but he's asking if he he's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing his plants indoors and he's
getting them started so that he can put
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside July 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's asking so far he's got them under
a 24 hour light cycle and he's asking if
[SPEAKER_00]: he should adjust his light schedule to 18
six to get them ready for the outdoor sun
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm talking really fast,
so I'm going to press pause for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs in
a drink and I will be right back and we
[SPEAKER_00]: will talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I had enough dabs to kind of
override all of the caffeine I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some fat dabs of lemon G grown
by myself at the Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: Wellness Garden, extracted by our good
friends at Turpex and available on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves at Green and Healthy Wellness in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm talking about Green and Healthy
Wellness, I want to do two quick shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to John Randall Jr. That
dude has been trimming his ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you shop at Green
and Healthy Wellness, most of the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: there are trimmed by our friend Randall's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you follow Randall's on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at nugtendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him know that you appreciate the way
he is trimming the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I owe a huge shout out to my new
friend, Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach is helping out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach, you were killing it, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a day off and I came back and all
of the plants were still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that Green and Healthy
Wellness is a medical cannabis only
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs does not allow any
recreational cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to shop with us,
you do need your purple medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop in and see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green and Healthy Wellness, 430 West
Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to help you out with all of your
medical cannabis needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check us out in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're called Nugs 303.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, a medical only facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, let's get back to this listener
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our listener was asking about putting his
plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had them on a 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know if he should adjust his
lights to an 18 six photo period before
[SPEAKER_00]: taking them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I sent Jesse a message and I
asked him what he thought about this
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had my own idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and I have two different ideas on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both of these ideas are going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this before I get too far into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you do, I recommend that
you take these plants outside and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sun for maybe two hours on the
first day and then bring them back inside
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take them outside and put them in
the sun for maybe two and a half to three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day and then bring them back
inside and then take them back outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: just give them like, you know,
maybe 30 to another hour every day of
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight so they can get used to that sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe by about the seventh to 10th
day, you could just leave them out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you should slowly adjust them
to the sun or they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might get fried.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're, if they're not super hardy
plants, that sun might kick their ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, slowly introduce
them to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you just put them out there,
they're going to get a sunburn and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion about your light cycle was that
you should just leave your lights on 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and then start taking the plants out
and get them adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you take them outside,
once you're permanently out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have them in pots and you're going
to leave them out there, or if you put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the ground, once they're out there
forever, it will only take a few days for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to adjust to the sun's natural photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is much more intense than the
light that you have in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will, it will train those plants what
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are specific spectrums that the sun
puts off at sunrise and sunset that
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger hormones inside your plant that
tell it when to go to sleep and when to
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun will start programming your
plant when to wake up and when to sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take very long for your plant to
adjust to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave your grow lights on 24 seven,
then you take it outside and you throw it
[SPEAKER_00]: in that sun on that normal cycle,
it may start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only downfall to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may start to auto flower a little bit
early and then it'll go back into veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it will flower at the appropriate
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be an issue if you have a
plant that has a very, very sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the only downfall to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Jesse said to do was to try to
match the schedule of the sun with the
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule of your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a little bit
challenging because like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that the news or your farmer's
almanac are going to say that the sun is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to rise and set, that is those times
in those books and on the news are
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when do the far red and near red
spectrums of the sun start shining onto
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to figure that out exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to try to match
the sun rise and sunset as best you can to
[SPEAKER_00]: get those plants on sort of a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that you'd be just fine if you
ran that 24 hour light cycle and slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce your plants to the sun it's
called hardening them off, get them nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and stable, put them in their forever
homes and then just let the sun work its
[SPEAKER_00]: magic and put those plants into its
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the time and the energy,
do some research, find out what time the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun will be setting and rising for about a
week and then start adjusting your timers
[SPEAKER_00]: every day to that schedule and get your
sunrise and sunset times matched up
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly to the outside time with the sun
and then start putting your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, harden them off and get them on
that schedule and by the time they are
[SPEAKER_00]: outside permanently, have them adjusted to
that schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the time and the energy to
research it and make that happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the energy and the time
for that, run it 24-7 and throw them out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running some indicas,
you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running some sativas,
they may start to flower on you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those sativas will flower a little
bit sooner because just a slight change in
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period is all they get in their
natural habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to trigger flowering with
just a little bit of a variation in photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do notice that your plants are
starting to flower a little bit too early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season, one good way to stop that
from happening or to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't happen is to get a light and get a
long extension cord and just carry a light
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and shine it over all of those
plants about three hours after the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down and that will keep those plants
awake and it won't let them turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: their flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way you can make sure that they
don't flower too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see them starting to flower a
little bit early, that's one way to revert
[SPEAKER_00]: and prevent this from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what kind of light you
use and it doesn't have to be really super
[SPEAKER_00]: intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you just get out there for a
few minutes and shine it over each plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll wake them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't start sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get enough sleep to go into
their flowering period and you can extend
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that helped you make a decision on
how you're going to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: your adjustment.
Just make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got powdery mildew, if you've
got spider mites, your shoes, your hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: your clothes, it's the greatest way to
move those bugs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just introduce problems to every
garden you go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep in mind when you're moving
from one place to another, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: from your garden to your friend's garden
to another person's garden, just keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind you're just spreading garden STDs
everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a change of clothes in your car if
you're that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can to stop spreading spider
mites and fucking powdery mildew through
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough listener emails
for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everybody that sends me
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me messages at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get messages from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like making content that is aimed at
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know that I'm giving you what
you want and what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it easy for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to a
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company does not pay me, or at least
not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they will after they hear this,
but this is just a genuine product
[SPEAKER_00]: endorsement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I can highly recommend a product
called Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Time Exterminator will get rid of your
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it for a patient of mine who's got
a small garden, an elderly gentleman who
[SPEAKER_00]: needs a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a powdery mildew issue,
and Big Time Exterminator seems to have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten rid of his powdery mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it got rid of white flies in another
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen a white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen a spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a fungus net.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like Big Time Exterminator is
doing a very good job at getting rid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also approved by the Colorado MED,
so it is allowed to be used in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow let those guys know that I am
endorsing their product for free,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it work, and I approve of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great product, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find yourself some of that if you've
got some powdery mildew or spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just use it as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will definitely work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, that's enough product
endorsements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another episode coming up pretty
soon for my friend Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred asked about harvesting a seed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has done his first breeding project.

episode for you all about how to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of your seed harvest.
