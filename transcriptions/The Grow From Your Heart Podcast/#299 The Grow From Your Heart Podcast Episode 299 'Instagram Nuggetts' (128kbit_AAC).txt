[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a bonus episode of the
Instagram Live Feed Podcast Bonus Episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the question was, what are the
benefits and drawbacks of bigger oil rig
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a smaller oil rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: A small oil rig makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a small Hitman rig right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would say that's really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I like it small is because I'm
not trying to fill this chamber with smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and carb it like we used to do with the
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my smoke to go from the nail down
this tube into the water to cool it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I want that smoke in my lungs,
in my head punching me as quick and hard
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a big chamber filled with
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the point of a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a bong, you light it and you suck and
suck and suck until this big old glass
[SPEAKER_00]: area, the whole area is filled with smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you pull the carb and then you get a
bunch of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: With oil, you don't really need that
because as soon as you hit the oil onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the nail and put a carb cap on there,
you're getting plenty of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like a big rig because I'm not
trying to inhale a gallon of oxygen or a
[SPEAKER_00]: liter of oxygen before I even start
getting my dab into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to breathe in the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this little rig, there's no
resistance and hesitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as soon as my dab touches this
nail, the smoke is in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes through the water just enough
to get cooled and then it goes into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a whole bunch of extra glass
for the resin to stick to and steal my
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to suck in a whole bunch of
extra oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to get a big ol' smoky
fill and then pull it and carb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all coming to me right at once
because I've got a little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not smoking flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna smoke all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With flowers, you're gonna smoke until
that chamber is full and then you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's as much smoke as I can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you carb it and then you put the
bowl back in and you pass it to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: dude and he gets a rip, unless you're
doing snaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, there's no need to get that
big ass chamber of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a small rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here is perfect to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Hitman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Hammerhead because of the
perk inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perk goes straight down and it splits
out left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bubbles out of the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Hammerhead perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits in a cup holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the size rig I think is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my rant on benefits and
drawbacks of bigger versus smaller rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to fill up a whole bunch of
space with smoke and I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a whole bunch of air before I get my
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna take a dab right to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my rant on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you heat the glass part?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on which glass part you're
using, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how thick it is and what
size it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two different nails right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I have to heat for about a count
of 45 or 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, I only give this one like a
35 to 45 count.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just two different styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let it cool until I feel like it's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go hotter than most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do it is to practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat it up, let it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat it up till it kinda glows and then
set a timer and count 45 seconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: then hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel it was too hot or too cold,
set your timer for 30 or a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try again and just see where you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no perfect temp for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say there is a perfect temp or this
is the perfect temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like kind of a hot dab because I like a
big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about the lung expansion
part that I feel in my lungs that I enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to take really cold
dabs and when you do that, you waste a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and then you gotta get a Q-tip and
clean it out and I think that's kinda
[SPEAKER_00]: silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to clean shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here trying to smoke to waste it
to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps me out mentally, physically,
spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you talk about interesting
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now defend why you like it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about that lung
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes your breath away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you, I don't know, it kinda makes
your body go into shock maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something about that feeling
of, it's a mixture of a stroke,
[SPEAKER_00]: an orgasm, a heart attack, a panic attack,
and bliss and ecstasy for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's adrenaline in that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not supposed to get that
much smoke at that heat in your body at
[SPEAKER_00]: that one time, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my body goes, hoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something that comes with the
high also with that that I just enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my defense for it, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because I do, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glow squad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been thinking about switching rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go with something kinda small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to go expensive either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna buy a rig, make sure that
when you draw through it, that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: put water in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch, I'm gonna hit it semi-hard and
hopefully I don't get water in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even gonna dab through it that
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you can put water in it to
get bubbles and not get water in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth, that's an important thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is it comfortable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it up to your face and think about
dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gonna work?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your drying process in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole episode about drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quick rant about drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying and curing actually starts a few
days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go in and pull off all the big
leaves, all the fan leaves, anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: a petiole, anything that's hanging off,
anything you can snap off with your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger, anything with a purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the larger leaves have now got
purple stems at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snap all those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can cut off without scissors,
just go in there with your fingers and
[SPEAKER_00]: pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let the plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the day you plant on harvesting,
go in there and cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang them upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them hang until the sticks pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the stems to snap when you bend
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to explode with
dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to be pow and then
they fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them to just go crunch when you
bend them in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't make a crunchy noise,
they're not dry enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are gonna be real, well they'll be
real wet when you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be rubbery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be real juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go until they pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when they pop, then you can cut the
buds off of the sticks and you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: them into an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna grab something, but it's over
there out of reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the buds into an airtight container
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can start trimming them at will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you need to trim some buds,
dump them out on the table, trim them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into the next jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That next jar is where your trim buds go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're drying and curing them in that
jar at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the sticks pop, get them into the
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make sure you open that jar
frequently because you do not want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting funky in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get them into the jar,
open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how moist they are when they
go in there, honestly, it's gonna kinda
[SPEAKER_00]: depend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would open them up about two hours after
you put them in there and feel them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it wet inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does, leave that jar open for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, close it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it again in four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too wet, dump them out and just
let them sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let them sit out like on a table or
something just for a few hours until they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't feel real squishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put them back in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want them to dry slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them to dry fairly slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slower the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang them up for four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically your dry process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the sticks start popping,
now you're safe to put them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: container, an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them off the sticks, get them into an
airtight container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been trimmed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna trim them before you put them
into the container, you can, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to be trimmed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I do it because I've got large
batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go into a container and then you
have to burp that container frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The burping interval will extend over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your first day, you're gonna wanna burp
them like every two or four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna wanna be kind of obsessive in
there and get in there and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start getting a warm, hay,
funk sort of a smell, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts smelling like ammonia,
you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You waited too long to open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every two to four hours, open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stir those buds around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're not getting funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure nothing's pressed together too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure nothing is too juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's not sweating in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it open for 15 to 45 minutes based
on how much moisture is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're gonna have to learn this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an art that you're gonna have to
adjust to in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much humidity is in your
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the vapor pressure deficit in
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the temperature in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much water content is in
your starting product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is gonna have to be
adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it in the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burp those jars frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you have time, dump it out and
trim what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate the little trim leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that aside for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the buds in another jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna have to burp those dried
and cured buds as frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can seal them up, put them on the
shelf, or put them in ounce jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you wanna do it, quarter pound
bags, fucking pound baggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you wanna do it, stack them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just check them out every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they don't get too dry or too
wet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Juanzilla just asked, what are your
thoughts on Boveda or the Boost Two-Way
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidipacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like them because they kind of put
a weird wet taste in my product is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were using them at the dispensary
before I was part of management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would dry and cure the buds at the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would throw a few Boveda packs
in the packages and seal it up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: drive it to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would take the product and put it
into a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would add a Boveda pack to
each jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I would buy the flowers,
I could tell something was funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I noticed that it was the Boveda
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started taking those out and I
think it tastes like cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it imparts a watery taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts a wet flavor into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your buds are too dry, maybe that would
help you moisten them up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, it gets really dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why people use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the Colorado crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your herb is dried and cured
properly, you probably shouldn't need a
[SPEAKER_00]: Boveda pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I feel about bud stored in a
freezer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been dried and cured properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was dried and cured properly and
then it's sealed in something to where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that there's no moisture going to get
in there, I don't see a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: storing it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't find it necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the refrigerator, that would be
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to freeze it, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freezing is a good way to preserve shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know what that's going to do
to your cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in a bag, then glass, then freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if that's what you want to do,
man, that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may be doing something to your
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to convert the THC and the CBD
to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that heat converts things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cold's got to be doing something to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps are essentially VOCs, which break
down with light water and air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wouldn't burping be counterproductive?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dried, then just lock it in a jar
for a week or two preserves more terps
[SPEAKER_00]: than burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but also if you trap it in that jar,
you got to burp it to get the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to remove chlorophyll is to
have moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxygen and the moisture and the
darkness create anaerobic acid within the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and that starts breaking down
the chlorophyll and xanophil, and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it able to become a vapor, which when you
open the lid, that escapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without opening the lid, that wouldn't
be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you kept it closed for too long,
it would get funky in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we do want to preserve the terps,
but we have to get the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, keeping it in the jar would be
better for terps, but you got to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: dried and cured first before you want to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get the chlorophyll and the
xanophil out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is have a
little bit of moisture so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll comes out during curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it drops a water molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that water comes out, it brings out
the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture and the oxygen create an acid
in there that help break down that
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open the jar, that pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when it loses that water molecule,
the THC drops a water molecule and becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: more psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the drying and curing process
are all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is homemade, open, and BHO decent if
purged properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about open blasts,
like somebody just blasting it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: house or in their backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're not blasting in the
house, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, back in the day, all we had was
homemade, open blasted, BHO, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what people used to win cups and
shit with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if it's purged properly,
it can be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the better stuff is still the
small batch stuff, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good idea about your keeper
phenol while hunting before smoking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, as the grower and the breeder,
I can see it by week five or six,
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long veg my plants before flip,
mate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do I veg my plants before I flip?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all based on the size of your grow
space and how many plants you've got and
[SPEAKER_00]: how long you've got to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a low ceiling, you gotta
flip early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a whole bunch of space,
go forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the size of pot you're gonna
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the size of plant you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you finish, I would say veg it until
it is about a third of the size you want
[SPEAKER_00]: it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third to a half, it's gonna double or
triple in size based on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start off, if you veg your plant
until it's a foot tall, by the time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done, it is going to be two to three feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, it's gonna double or
triple in size depending on the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics, where it's from and how much
light you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough light,
it's gonna stretch even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first three weeks of flower,
that plant is gonna take off and skyrocket
[SPEAKER_00]: and just start stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to learn how to keep it
down if it gets too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So veg it until, if you've got six foot
ceilings, I would say veg it until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about two feet tall and then you gotta
flip it because it's gonna end up six feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall by the time it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe flip it at 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do the math and make sure to save
yourself some ceiling height from the
[SPEAKER_00]: light because you wanna be at least 16 to
18 inches from the light if you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: really hot light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to get closer if you've
got some cooler lights but you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to save yourself some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long do I let my plants veg before
I flip without knowing about your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space, without knowing about your plants,
your pot size, your environment or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: My best guess is to say let them get half
to two thirds or half to a third of the
[SPEAKER_00]: size you want them when they're done
because they're gonna double or triple in
[SPEAKER_00]: size by the time they finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your favorite stem turps you look
for in your male plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about when I rub the stem on
my male plants, what is the aroma and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kinda depends on what I'm going after.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds disgusting but the puke turp,
there are male plants that smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great success with male plants
that smell like puke every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells like vomit on the stem rub,
it's always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells like vomit and it makes
trichomes and turns purple, that's always
[SPEAKER_00]: a good male plant in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking to breed something more on
the sweet side, I start looking for those
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking for a fruit or a candy
flavor, I kinda start looking for that on
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it goes into flower,
I'll go bust open some of the male flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and smell them and rub my fingers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male plant's gonna put off some good
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go with just stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go up on the flowers also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your male plants go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they flower out and give you
pollen around 25 days and you can coat the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole fucking room doesn't mean you have
to cut it down then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the trichomes build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's something else you can do that
I don't talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a trade secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I don't know how
many breeders do this, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I thought of a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not reverse a male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a male plant and you wanna
know what kind of flavors and aromas it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put off, reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we reverse our female plants to
make males, you can reverse a male to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reverse your male plants to make
them females so then you can see what they
[SPEAKER_00]: do as a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what your progeny from that
male has potential of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what you're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I worded that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your male plant turn into a
girl and then you'll have an idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: it would look like as a girl and you'll
have an idea of what you're gonna make
[SPEAKER_00]: when you breed with that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to find out what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about the burners for
spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid of flavor in my buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burners for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you burning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about sulfur burners for
spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that a sulfur burner for
spider mites is what you would do and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that that's what you're talking
about but tell me more and I'll try to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burners for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up 702?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for jumping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about semi-industrial
home rosin presses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think rosin tastes like a burnt popcorn
or a popsicle stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not happy with rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: No thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no good info for you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend has a burner and he said he
would give me but I can just order
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I would order the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in flower and you have got
bugs, the predatory mites are probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the Swarovskys, the Californus,
maybe get yourself some lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even fuck around with the praying
mantis at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there with smaller predator
mites and let them do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you avoid in a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Way too stretchiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a 10 pack of seeds and five of
them are a boy, five of them are girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never use the first two males that
flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may sound weird but those two,
the first two males to show me that their
[SPEAKER_00]: boys are gonna be too robust, they're
gonna make hemp, they're gonna be too
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant in my cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my crosses will come out just like
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to find a male that if I had five
males, probably that third or fourth one
[SPEAKER_00]: that flips that starts to show me that he
has a strong stud, that's probably more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be used than the first two,
the third or fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it auto flowers, I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can't handle nutrients, I don't want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't give me any trichomes or any
colors, I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't have a good structure,
I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's more of what I do want is easier
to list than what I avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what about stripping the males of a
select few pollen branches or just let it
[SPEAKER_00]: go natural?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't lollipop as heavily as I do my
female plants, but I do lollipop a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they start going,
I like to set them up on another plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: that he gets up a little bit higher,
so that he's up above the canopy a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit so that when he does start dumping,
his stuff falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't strip them too heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of branches because I need a
lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I fuck around, I use a lot of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavors do you prefer, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit tasting strains or fuel and chemi
type strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it just depends on what I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In flowers, if I'm smoking... So you're
from the UK, if I recall correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call the buds the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates, the hash, we call that
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flowers, I prefer more of the
gassy, chemi, fuel kind of flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the earthy stuff out of my flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm smoking concentrates,
I like the candy, fruit, lemon,
[SPEAKER_00]: skittly, kind of watermelon-y sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowery, earthy concentrates,
or flowery, earthy flowers, earthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy flowers, fuely flowers, and candy
concentrates is kind of my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a fat dab of some Stardog or
whatever you got, if it tastes earthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: fuely, but I would just prefer the candy
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dosi dough that I was smoking,
it had like a nice vanilla creamsicle sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a thing to it with some chocolate
behind it and some earth in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skywalkers got straight up this cush,
but then I've got this lemon taffy that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's candy and lemons, which I really
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got, what else do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the cantaloupe, which is real
fruity, and it tastes like a cantaloupe,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly.
