[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 388 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that I start the
show off by letting you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Fatso OG from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Fatso OG full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just the right amount of chunky
crystals and just the right amount of terp
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do approve of that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross on this, or the blend actually,
is GMO and Legend OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as dark roast
coffee, garlic, and fuel, and I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that is absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has given me some ridiculous cotton
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can almost hear it on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I have been having a
really busy couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out of town twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back out of town Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a comedy show in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will be attending the Endo Expo in
Denver on Saturday and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am doing another repost for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode was determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know when the plants are ripe,
it is time to begin flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that many new growers and many
experienced growers overlook the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of flushing our plants and it
is not happening properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this in the episode over
and over again, but flushing is free and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can improve the overall quality of your
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why wouldn't we focus heavily on
flushing at the end of the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm going to say that plenty of
times through this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's jump right
into an episode about flushing our ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 320 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check out our friends
at P.L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at P.L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, first off,
let me apologize for my terrible sounding
[SPEAKER_00]: voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Brett, also known as Mary's
Motivation, had a going away party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to that going away party and I
smoked way too much flour and way too much
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate and my voice sounds like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of a chest cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a throat thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a sinus thing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we get too far, I just want to
apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you for listening to
this episode while I sound like poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start the episode off by
letting you know what I'm smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking little baby dabs of Gorilla
Glue 4 Ambrosia and also I've got some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going light today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to stay lightly medicated and
not mess up my lungs and throat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the path to recovery and I want to
keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a minute ago, I mentioned that I went
to my friend Brett, also known as Mary's
[SPEAKER_00]: Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Brett's going away party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett is leaving the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett's a little scared and nervous about
his trip, but honestly, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody deserves this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett needs to make this adventure happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a great
experience for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am super proud and super excited for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His party was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the party, we were joined by,
of course, the always awesome Brett was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab and Granny and and Kevin showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mama Bear Dabs was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to see Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to bump into my friend Twisty Seeds,
who I don't see very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to have a conversation, a long
conversation with Chandler Dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earl Tycoon was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude from Hits on Hand was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: LJ Fresh was there and several other new
and old friends were there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of folks there who
brought Canna Gars, which are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: blunt, rolled with cannabis leaves as the
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really fucked up my lungs,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs did not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were delicious to smoke and we got
really lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is why I think I sound like crap
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Brett for the great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party was a private party,
so not a lot of people were invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event was at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shout out to everyone at
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do an event there,
every time we do a large or small party
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it goes very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is very inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff is very accommodating and I
always have a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody who came to
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra huge shout out to Brett for inviting
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was only able to invite 30 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to be amongst those 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great party, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked that place out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For how few people there were in there,
it was a pretty big building and we smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: that bitch out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear to my voice still All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I've still got some good voice left,
let's do a quick podcast about flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we talk about flushing,
I should do a quick recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I talked about
determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I went fairly fast and we got
kind of rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I made it clear that determining
ripeness is usually done by using some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a loop so that you can see the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned using a 60 or 100 X loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends from Instagram,
what's up, Dank Sinatra?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Dank Sinatra, sheer photo and
seeds, sent me a message and he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I can't see trichomes with my naked
eye, but I can tell ripeness of a trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: with a 16 X jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, of course, in my mind,
I'm in my mid 20s, so my eyes may work a
[SPEAKER_00]: little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, dude, you are a little bit younger
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got those fresh new eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he corrected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he can see the trichomes with a 16
X jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not need that bigger loop,
that 60, that 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the 60 is working or the 16 is
working for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need that big loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 may get you through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's recap a little bit about what
I said about harvest times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that if you have a plant that is
said to go 60 days, let it go the full 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days and start flushing at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that's supposed to
go 70 days, let it go the full 70 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: start flushing around day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may say, Rasta Jeff, I want to
dial it in and cut these plants down at
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're going to have to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I wanted to stress is this is
not your last grow with this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is your first run with
this cultivar, with this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a new girlfriend that
you've got to learn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take her out a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to see if she wants to come
down at day 60, day 63, maybe day 67,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe day 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dial it in exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly to the right day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use different nutrients,
you may get different ripening days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a little bit of temperature
difference, you may get a different
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to find the window
and dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is not your last grow with
this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is the first of many grows
with a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's your first run with the 60 day
cut, start flushing around day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time with a cut that
you think may go 70 days, start flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: it around day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you get to day 60 or day 70 on
whichever plant you're running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to cut it down just because
you've been flushing for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying more attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not amber, don't cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep flushing for a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to over flush than under
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you're doing is not giving
it nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten a little beefier,
but we're just trying to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how to determine when to begin
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know the cultivar that you're
using, maybe it's a brand new seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's a new clone, maybe you're just
new at growing and you don't know when to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allowing the plant 60 to 70 days to grow
and then giving yourself extra time at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end is always your best bet with a new
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I have established how to
tell if the plant is ripe and ready to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we have a good idea of
when to start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about flushing our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think flushing is super simple and it's
something people could easily improve and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really skipping that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure why, because it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy step to improve your
cannabis and it is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people simply don't understand the
importance of flushing and why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you quickly why flushing
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine you've been pouring salty
nutrients into this plant for nine weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of flour plus another three or four weeks
of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just been filling it up with
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring whatever nutrient
brand you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been pouring carbohydrates into
these plants for the past 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of that stuff is built up inside
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not using all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's letting some of it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turning some of it into a gas and
transpiring some of it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of it is still in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those nutrients are left in the plant
when we harvest, dry and cure that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to taste like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed too much Kalmag, too late in
flour, you're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed your plants too much potassium
silicate, late in flour, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants are not going to burn
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dry and cure these buds,
they're not going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grind it up in a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to roll a joint and it's just
going to burn black and make a funky weird
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there are leftover
nutrients that you did not flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get that stuff out of there by
properly flushing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were mostly flushing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to clean out the soil so there's
nothing left in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's soil, soil-less mix,
if you've got peat, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working in, you're going to want to flush
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's rock wool, if it's cocoa,
you need to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each thing is going to take a different
amount of time to clean out, but you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean that out so the roots don't have
anything to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant will start starving itself
and it will start showing its harvest fall
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and it will taste proper when you
dry it, cure it, and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why flushing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get all those excess nutrients
out of there, all those excess salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you roll a joint and smoke it,
you don't want it to turn into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: briquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to turn into a nice white
fluffy ash and just flake away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from a properly flushed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that also comes from a properly
dried, cured, and trimmed plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that comes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're focusing on flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why flushing is important,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your herb to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to burn well, and you want it
to leave a nice, white, clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: soft ash with no weird chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about flushing the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing the plants is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 to 14 days before you plan on
harvesting the plants, prepare the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water that you would normally water the
garden with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 1,000 watt light,
maybe you've got a five gallon bucket full
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that amount of water ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you would normally put nutrients into
the water, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, if you're going to add anything,
put some enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an enzyme, that will help
break down all the decaying roots and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the matter inside of the root zone,
and it will speed up the process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are pretty much the only thing I
would put in there other than maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one to two grams of shine from veg
bloom, but you really don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly, all you would need is some enzymes
for the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to flush for 14 days,
maybe go for four to seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: add two grams of shine, and add some
enzymes, but then cut out the shine and
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep the enzymes going until the end
of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you would put in there are
enzymes and possibly some shine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you would be probably just fine with
nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add the enzymes if you're going to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: For four to seven days, add the shine if
you'd like to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, adjust the pH to somewhere between
6.3 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine, 6.3 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good window to adjust it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, simply water the plants with that
minimal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is pour that right
into the plants just like you normally do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak the plants and let it run through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you're doing, pouring the
enzymes in there is going to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural decaying process happen inside
that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dead things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots that are dying are dying in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes are going to eat that,
and they're going to speed up that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that shine is going to keep adding
density and tricone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need to flush for the last week
without the shine, so make sure you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave the enzymes in there if
you'd like to at the end, but cut out that
[SPEAKER_00]: shine for the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're probably at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to cut down at day 60,
we're at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mixed up a bunch of water,
and we just soaked that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got pHed water with enzymes
and possibly some shine running through
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are going to start looking
for phosphorus and potassium and
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum and all the other things that
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 16 minerals that the plants
really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys start thinking about that and
learn all 16 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really help you think about what
you're feeding your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll talk about that in the future,
but the plant's going to start looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, and all it's going to find are
enzymes and shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like, well, I've got
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go beef up my trichomes,
and it's got stuff to build trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have the building blocks to
grow more plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have all the nutrition that it
needs to keep building bigger buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter stems and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's going to start showing you its
fall color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start turning into these
yellow, golden colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some unique oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like taking pictures of my plants
right at the flush phase because they
[SPEAKER_00]: really start showing great colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are nice and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are all greasy and shiny,
and then the leaves start getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: cool golden tones to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when you know that the flush is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no nutrients left in that soil
for the plant to eat, and it is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry, which is a good thing because now
you know that bud is going to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, molybdenum,
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, calcium, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have all this other
funky shit in it that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll burn nice and smoothly, and it will
taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to start seeing these
fall colors come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timing is going to depend on your
medium, how much nutrients you have been
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very strain specific,
and also temperatures are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge effect on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a little cooler in the room,
your plants are going to turn a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lower nighttime temperature,
you'll see a little more purple from the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little more fall activity
from the plants like would happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to mix up the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, depending on your container size and
the vapor pressure deficit in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to have to water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the shine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH adjust it to 6.3 to 6.5, and water it
right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat this process right up to a week
before harvest, and then do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but simply take out the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add the enzymes, adjust the pH,
and then feed it right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the enzymes are totally not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shine is totally not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all of this with plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding the enzymes and shine,
you are going to have connoisseur quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do the shine up to the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, after that, I would just do the
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, I'd probably do just two or three
days of plain water just to give them time
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going that 60 days, I would end
up going 63, and that last three days
[SPEAKER_00]: would just be plain water, and my grow is
what would happen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just keep repeating the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse these plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse the soil out as many
times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking that much time to water,
that means you've got a large container,
[SPEAKER_00]: or that much time between waterings means
you've got a large container, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using quite a bit of water to flush
that out, which means you need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to get at least 10% to 30% runoff
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you've got a 10 gallon pot,
you're going to want to get at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: to two gallons of runoff coming out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you're flushing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, get plenty of water coming out,
and then flush the shit out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it as many times as you can,
but be careful not to drown the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to sneak in another flush time
just to get more water in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that may do more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill the fucking plant right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just drown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may suffocate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be cutting down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't ruin it right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay on your normal watering
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you soak the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that as many times as you can in the
last 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to add the enzymes,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use Shine, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only things I would really
add at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have determined how to tell if the
plants are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have determined a good time to start
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to put in the water to flush
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know why we're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically don't mix anything up,
and you run that through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will clean out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that's happening, we're going to see
colors changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see trichomes ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see plants finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're going to get a bunch of funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your genetics, your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get funky yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get dead foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem with just yanking that
dead stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just pull all that dead stuff off and
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, about a week, maybe five or three
days before you harvest, go in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and just start stripping off all the
big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to save you a lot of time
when it does come time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be all these big giant leaves
in your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut them off while the plant is
standing up, while they're still stiff,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just snap them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need scissors for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the thumb technique of just
popping a leaf off, you can just go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and de-foliate a whole section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days before harvest, go in there and
pull off all those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you a big headache and a
bunch of time when it comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang them upside down, dry them,
and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes time to trim, half the
leaves are already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will save you a lot of bullshit and a
lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them starting to get funky,
take off the dead ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, just a few days before harvest,
probably when you cut out the shine maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go in there and start pulling off the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing you might want to do is
you might want to reduce the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not create a large swing in temps
between your day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go too cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not try to create something drastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can bring it down two or three
degrees during the day and two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees during the night, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go crazy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shock the plants right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give yourself powdery mildew right
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to mimic nature and get a little
bit colder right at the end because what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens right at the end of the season,
it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how things know, oh shit,
it's winter time and those plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: hurry up and finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you'll see more color, you may get a
little more density, and cool temps are
[SPEAKER_00]: good for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, lower the temperatures a little bit
right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I'm sure people are going
to send me messages about and ask is,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I use any flushing agents?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not use a flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of the flushing agents are
kind of a sales tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they make your herb taste like
whatever they taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to put in a new
ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I do not use a flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to use anything, I would just
use the solution I told you, the enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shine, and then I would add
powdered coconut water would be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing solution that I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are saying,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, coconut water would be ideal,
but that would get very expensive to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it, have that much coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine trying to get a five gallon bucket
of coconut water shipped to your house
[SPEAKER_00]: every three days for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get real expensive,
but you can buy powdered coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is readily available from a lot of grow
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build-A-Soil can take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not sponsor the show or anything,
but I know that that's a reliable source
[SPEAKER_00]: for powdered coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I should mention,
a lot of people are growing no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing in living soil
or super soil or some sort of live soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if that is what you're working
with, you probably do not need to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have created the perfect
environment inside your plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere to where it's taking up what
it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not feeding it bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being force-fed shit,
so it doesn't need to be flushed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Subcool, when he would mix up a
batch of super soil and put a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, he would just beat it water for the
whole flowering phase, and he would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been flushing the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before people start sending me emails,
yes, there are some situations where you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not need to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going no-till, if you're going
all organic, flushing is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running that, you're
already up to speed and you know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to teach you about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in the advanced black belt class
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've got one more thing I should
mention before I wrap up this so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: quickie episode that's going on for 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good thing to do is to measure the EC or
the PPMs of your runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are pouring a bunch of water into your
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect the water that comes out of the
bottom of your plant into some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your pH pen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your EC or PPM pen in there and see
what the EC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a soil or a soilless
mix, you're only going to get down so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cocoa, you can get those PPMs
down really, really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe before you start flushing,
the first day you flush, measure what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then measure each time and see how low you
can get it and then just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low it goes every day and see how
low you can get the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give any recommendations
on how low to try and get it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to vary based on your medium and I
don't want to fuck up your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn this based
on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa, you'll get it really low because
cocoa is inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa is not going to hold shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to get the PPMs of your
rockwool and your cocoa down to amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, soilless mixes, those are still
going to have some high PPMs because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are soil and soilless mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But play with your runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low you can get it and it'll be a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a fun experiment and then you'll
actually see what's going in and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should just talk about measuring
runoff anyway in a full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about checking the EC or the
PPMs of a solution before you pour it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and then we'll re-measure that
same solution, the EC or the PPMs when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of the bottom of your plants and
we'll compare that to the pH going in and
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH coming out and we'll see what's
happening in your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys measure the electrical
conductivity or the particles per million
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's coming out of your plant and you
will know if you need to flush more or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you cut it down,
write down the PPMs and then pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are satisfied,
hit that number next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not satisfied, maybe flush a
little longer and try to go lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be discouraged because it's not
all about the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have dry and cure to fuck this
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could ruin your whole crop after you
cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank
you for listening to my flushing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we have done determining ripeness,
determining when to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next episode in line is
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we're going to do the
dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some interruptions to that
schedule because I've got an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled with some friends and things
always pop up, but those are on the chart
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for
listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me ramble for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you felt like this podcast was
educational and you learned something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would like to contribute to the
podcast financially, I would truly
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the support and you can do so
by going to patreon.com slash grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart and all of the information that
you need to sign up will be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really simple and I would appreciate
the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging for payments or
contributions or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do this podcast forever for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not trying to get rich off of
podcasting, but there are a few people who
[SPEAKER_00]: said they would like to contribute to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make sure there is an
opportunity for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will do with those funds is I will
pay for my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I host this podcast on my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a little bit of money to do that
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I purchased a better MacBook so that
I could record more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: My old computer was not efficient is the
polite way to say it, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions will help to go pay for the
MacBook that I bought and also cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you may have heard Mike mentioned
that the little microphone cover needed
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the funding for things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to contribute,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will quit begging because that got
uncomfortable quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if
you would stalk me on all of the social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
