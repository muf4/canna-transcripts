[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I like to start
these episodes by letting you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: am smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I took a little container and I
threw some of the Lemon OG live resin in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I topped it off with some Lemon
Jeffrey high terpene full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took way too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of burned my nose and made my eyes
water a little bit and it made my head
[SPEAKER_00]: spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go sit on the couch and
reconfigure my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after I learned how to walk and talk
again, everything was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at the Garden
of Whedon for the amazing Lemon OG live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, shout out to my friends at
Apothecary for the Lemon Jeffrey high
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when I talk about the high
terpene full spectrum extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: people say, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is about 95% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took Lemon Jeffrey flowers and
extracted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the exact extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to act like I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they make high terpene and high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the aroma and flavor put into a
liquid form in a small vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take a little bit of that and I mix
it in with my other concentrates and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enhances the lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings out the lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in the Lemon Jeffrey
terps that do a really good thing to my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get what I call glitches or
skips toward my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just seems like the thoughts just won't
connect as easily as they normally should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke some of the high terpene full
spectrum extract that came from the Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey and it fixes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my brain work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great combo for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Lemon Jeffrey high terpene full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love anything Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, I'm going to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to everybody involved in the
concentrates today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's get to a podcast, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn down this music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some sad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate starting off the podcast with sad
news, but I've got news I must share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that knows me knows that I have
been listening to a reggae artist by the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of Joseph Israel for quite a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Joseph Israel when I lived in
Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was coming through playing a couple of
shows and I got the privilege of promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: for the two shows that he did there in
Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I promoted for him, of course,
I got to meet him and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a great reggae show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved his band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved his style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved his vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first time I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I saw Joseph, I was taken
to a Matas Yahoo concert at the Beaumont
[SPEAKER_00]: Theater in Kansas City, Missouri for my
birthday in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matas Yahoo brought out this guy named
Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought him on stage and they sing a
song together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, that guy's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look for that guy in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shortly after that, I hear that
he is coming to Lawrence, Kansas,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was living at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend was a promoter and a booker
and he had happened to book Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows I'm a reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came to me and he said, hey,
will you promote this show for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which meant pass out flyers, pass out
stickers, just talk about it, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody in town knows that this guy
is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in return, he gave me a free ticket to
a Burning Spear concert that was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I advertised for Joseph Israel at
the Burning Spear concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's leaving Burning Spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passing them flyers for Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people came to the Joseph
Israel show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet Joseph, also known as Joseph
Fennell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to his family and friends, he was Jojo
or Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to meet Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph was a very knowledgeable and
spiritual and peaceful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time he came through Colorado or
wherever I was, he would stop and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute and spend some time with me after
his shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph was a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously what I'm leading up to is my
friend Joseph has passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's no longer with us and I'm
heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be okay, but I had to take a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: To share my love for Joseph on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph, I miss you and I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer's a motherfucker, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph was a very healthy, well,
tried to be a very healthy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph didn't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph didn't do drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph smoked very little cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did consume cannabis, but he didn't,
he wasn't a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smoked medicinally or, I don't even
know, spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smoked spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't, he wasn't, he wouldn't smoke
every time we lit up, but sometimes he'd
[SPEAKER_00]: want to participate if the time was right
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't drink caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't eat processed foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived on a farm in California with his
family and he raised his own fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables and ate his own foods and
taught about being, about eating clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dude died of cancer at 40 and I
find it to be fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer's a motherfucker, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surround yourself with people you love and
spend some time with the people you love
[SPEAKER_00]: because Joseph was healthy and then one
day he wasn't healthy and then he was
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no time to deal with it or
prepare for it or cope with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, hey, I'm on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was, hey everybody,
I have cancer and I'm going to try to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle of that process,
he didn't make it and he's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, shit happens so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let weird shit hold you back from
loving the people that you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go tell somebody you love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go give somebody a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be around those people because cancer
gives you some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Car crashes happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Car crashes happen fucking unexpectedly
and surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart attacks happen immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never really know when the people that
you love can be taken from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So love them while they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph, I love you and I miss you and I'll
see you on the other side, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think after that, I'm going to press
pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take way too big of a dab and
then I'll be right back to read some
[SPEAKER_00]: emails about auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to deliver content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, before I go too far,
I want to thank everybody for letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little personal on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to have an outlet and I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before I took a break,
I said that I was going to come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: read emails about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to send me an email and
get your email read on a future episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to check out patreon.com
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how you can get your email read
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's get right to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I am so very happy that I found your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just started listening today and I am
hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, I'm glad you found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to every episode that's
available in the feed, you can go to
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube and listen to the first 180
episodes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube and search for the grow from
your heart podcast and you will find old
[SPEAKER_00]: content that you'll get to listen to
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get caught up, check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says I'm a newbie at this,
but I've been listening reading and
[SPEAKER_00]: researching for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're doing it the right way,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening, reading and researching are
definitely the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm finally ready to
start a run except for a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I'm in a not so legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, be careful and be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can really say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, I'm kind of torn between auto
flower and photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, I will say photo period
just because I prefer photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like auto flower plants
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say go with photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep on with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am leaning towards a high grow
1000 watt led and a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to find some soil and go
as organically as possible all while
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to not break the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any insight for me,
it would be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if you had an auto flower
episode you couldn't refer me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being outspoken for the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get the first harvest on the
lookout or be on the lookout for me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of things you asked for
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you are not in a legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you once again is be
completely careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not trust anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring anybody to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post pictures of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hide that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your new biggest fucking secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first person you tell is going to tell
another person and that person is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a not legal state,
one of those people is going to be a cop
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to get fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring chicks to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for you to impress girls
by taking them to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impress yourself by having a cool ass
secret that none of those girls get to
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke dank ass weed with those girls,
but make them think you're buying it
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take girls to your grow to impress
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring dudes to your grow to impress
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to have anybody in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they know where it is, they can steal
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can snitch on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to say, Rasta Jeff,
you post pictures of your garden every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I live in Colorado where it is legal
and I'm not going to go to jail for having
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow photo period plants and don't tell
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring anybody to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, try to not be seen at the grow store
too frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the hydroponics store in your
neighborhood and they start knowing you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that you've been seen there and
that means that somebody knows what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and you will be looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get things delivered through
Amazon, I would recommend getting them
[SPEAKER_00]: from Amazon because everything comes in a
box and it has an Amazon smile on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be getting cleaning supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be getting food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be getting electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have gotten a new sweater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows that you've got a whole bunch
of nutrients in that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend buying your stuff online.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have to go to a grow
store, especially in an illegal area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's much cheaper online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds terrible because you
should support local business,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when local business wants to rip you
off, buy it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any insight for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to go a thousand watt LED
and a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five by five tent or a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to use a little bit of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a reason why your power bill
went up?
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to control odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also put it in a part of the house where
nobody's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I've got to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to encourage you to follow the
rules, not break the laws and do what the
[SPEAKER_00]: state laws are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, I have to tell you to be
prepared for what could happen to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever else is in that home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something should go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anything to go wrong with
anybody, but you have to keep in mind if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing cannabis in an illegal
state, shit could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The door could get torn off the hinges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men in uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniforms with guns could come in your
front door and put those guns in the faces
[SPEAKER_00]: of everybody in that home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will destroy your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will destroy your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to destroy your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the investigation and raid,
they will destroy everything that means
[SPEAKER_00]: something to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your speakers will be cut because there's
possible drugs hidden inside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your couch cushions will be cut open
because there could be drugs inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: your couch cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your contents of your fridge and freezer
will be dumped on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there could be drugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They take you to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave your house unlocked and your
house is open for your neighbors to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking steal all of your shit while
you're in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get bailed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, if you've got good friends,
then you get home and all of your shit is
[SPEAKER_00]: in disarray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably fired from your job
because you were just on the news for
[SPEAKER_00]: having an illegal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life will never be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow cannabis in an
illegal state, keep in mind that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what could happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to jail for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not see your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get to smoke cannabis for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get no booty for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might, but it might not be the booty
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be given some booty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that shit in mind if you're planning
on growing cannabis in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a broadcaster, being a responsible
adult, being somebody who wants to keep us
[SPEAKER_00]: both out of trouble, I have to say out
loud, I discourage anybody from breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: the law or growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know that we're adults and I know
that people are going to do whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can also encourage you to think and
do what you like as an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say legally, you shouldn't
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that when you do break
the law because you're an adult with free
[SPEAKER_00]: will, shit could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to have that slight fear in
your mind because that's what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep you careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing that hot girl from the bar to
your grow is going to get you sent to
[SPEAKER_00]: prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring the hot girl from the bar to
your jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the hot girl from the bar to your
house and smoke weed with her and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let her ever know you had a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to put it in your head,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit could go terribly wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to keep us all on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow from your heart if you're
in a fucking cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was just a random rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not write anything down about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just came to my head while I was
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're talking about trying to save
some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to spend decent money
on your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also talking about going organic
and not breaking the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to spend good money
on good amendments and good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a cheapskate on that because your
plants will show you that you were a cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: ass in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get to the main part that you
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, I wasn't sure if you had an auto
flower episode you couldn't refer me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do an auto flower episode where
basically I said that they're not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers do have a time and a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like an auto flower because you
can't take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you grow that auto flower and it's
the most amazing shit you've ever grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot take a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to buy seeds every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got one space and you're
not looking to keep clones and keep a mom
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a veg space, maybe auto flowers
are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can run one room and you can
just have constant stuff going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plant seeds every three weeks and
you can keep them all in the same room and
[SPEAKER_00]: then your shit will just keep flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not experienced enough with auto
flowers to have very good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like auto flowers, so I don't have
a lot of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice would be to grow photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also say, thanks for being outspoken
for the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the amazing work and when I get
the first harvest, be on the lookout for
[SPEAKER_00]: me on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, I hope that first harvest comes
off well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you stay out of trouble and I hope
nothing goes wrong and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing you on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also said, thanks for being
outspoken for the cause and to keep up the
[SPEAKER_00]: good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I think that was my job was to be
outspoken for cannabis, so I do not plan
[SPEAKER_00]: on stopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I am physically able and
mentally able and I've got all the right
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, I will continue to do this
podcast until it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one day I would like to
transition to this being mostly my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be young and agile forever
and when I get too old to be working in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and doing stuff like that,
I'd like to just shift to new media and
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting and YouTube and that sort of
thing and consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could, provide the income that I
provide by having a full-time job by
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting, I would totally make the
transition and I would do five new
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes a week and then I would do four
or five YouTube videos a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still find a way to be in
commercial grows and spend some time in
[SPEAKER_00]: large gardens, but as I get older,
I'm not gonna be able to work so hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that may be the plan for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inspired a lot of good ranting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question
about cannabis and you'd like me to read
[SPEAKER_00]: it, on a future episode, you can send me
an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next email comes from somebody
that I've interacted with before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sent me an email about auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read the most recent email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, your reply to my email and my
continuing listening to your awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast has led me to change the way I've
been thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my previous email, I was highly
considering auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to a couple of episodes on
breeding that you put out, I have changed
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a bit of soul searching and asked
myself what I really wanted to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to the conclusion that it's not the
speed of a grow necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about taking care of a plant
that has been around for centuries and to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve upon it if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good medicine for people who truly need
and enjoy it is my goal at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a goal so you're already on
the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully when my state comes out of the
dark ages, I'll be ready to step into the
[SPEAKER_00]: light with it, much like you and other
pioneers have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a thousand watt LED that is suited
for a four by four footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up some digital dream from Hela
Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 13 regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those seeds should I germinate
to ensure that I'm able to fill the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put some outside as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, have you heard of Bloom City Organic
Nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would a five gallon fabric pot be suitable
for what I think to be a big photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell Larry O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: An avid listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed it Lone Starred.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff to cover in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I'm glad that you decided to
grow photo period plants for the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that you decided you want to move
this plant forward and you want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: quality medicine and nourish a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: An auto flower plant, that's just fast
food of cannabis in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to prepare a meal and you want to
nourish people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great way to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you also say, you've got a thousand
watt LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's suited for a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how many of those seeds should you
germinate to be able to fill the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would germinate all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would germinate all 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only if a few things apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space to take a clone of all
13?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to, this is what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would germinate all 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would veg them out in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use six inch net pots or one
gallon, maybe two gallon pots at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg them out until you're able to get one
clone off of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got good clone tech and
one is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't trust yourself with one,
take two in case they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get one or two clones off of each
little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see roots on that clone,
start flowering the originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to find boys within seven
to 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them the fuck out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have approximately 50%
boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're down to somewhere between
five and seven plants in a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a nice little run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to veg those to fill
in the space a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those are going to fill in your four
by four area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully those clones root and you're
going to have plant number one and clone
[SPEAKER_00]: number one and plant number two and clone
number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you label them to where the
clone and the corresponding plant are
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any questions here because
what you're going to do, this is called a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grow these seeds and
you're going to find one or two that are
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others aren't going to be the ones you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be undesirable completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to grow too tall or too funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be one or two in there
that are what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find those and hopefully you've got a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of all the other clones and keep
those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's one that's obvious,
keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The keeper phenoh out of the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is the one you want to grow over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're going to keep a mother
plant of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we cut a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've only got one space,
this may not be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a place for
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a place for
mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a veg space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend having another small
area for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it's not always possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run all 13 of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would put them into flower when
they're little.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they start showing you sex,
take the boys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put your plants back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them at least 18 hours of light,
maybe 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer an 18 on six off veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put your plants back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know how many plants you're going
to flower and you can up pot them into
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can decide the size of pot based
on how many there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got more plants, you need to
stay with smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have smaller numbers, you can use
larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just decide based on how many females
you're going to take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you've got, if you've got four,
then you can do four five gallon pots if
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got six, I would do maybe three
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of base it on how many you've
got and how many you're going to fit in
[SPEAKER_00]: that four by four space comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about how long you want to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want this to be a quick run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want them in and out?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want them in and out, stay in small
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even bother up potting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to water more
frequently, but small pots will work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to veg them for quite a while
in your limited space, I would do bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger pots are going to give you more
time between waterings, but they also take
[SPEAKER_00]: up more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the way I would think
about how many to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that our situations are different,
but I would sprout them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find the good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unable to take clones,
fuck it, sprout them all, grow them all,
[SPEAKER_00]: finish it up, buy more seeds, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when that first crop comes down,
you get more space and you set yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: a veg area so that you can take clones and
keep those clones alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the most heartbreaking
things that has happened to me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, as a new grower, when I was just
getting started, I would plant seeds and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would grow these plants and I would take
pictures of them and I would nurture them
[SPEAKER_00]: for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd trim them up and I'd smoke them and it
would be fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have any clones of it because
I didn't know how to take clones worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and my clones would die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got the most amazing smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends are going, dude,
this weed is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't grow it again because I didn't
keep a clone and I couldn't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking clones to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had to go online and order
another six or 12 pack of those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because I couldn't get the clones to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend every time you grow
something, take a clone because you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the most amazing thing you've
ever grown and it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbreaking if you start off your first
grow or your second grow and you grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: hottest fire you've ever seen and you
don't even have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how many you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then up pop from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may be asking yourself,
did he say to put the plants in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for them to show sex and then put
them back into veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them into flower just long
enough to show you if they're boys or
[SPEAKER_00]: girls, it shouldn't be more than seven to
12 days honestly, before they are fully
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you if they're a boy or a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some books, go online, find pictures
of what male and female cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look like and become comfortable with
identifying that before the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there, identify your males,
get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would probably put the lights on
for seven to two hours without a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them on for 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to tell those plants you are
not flowering anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to go back to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put them on for 72, 48 to 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start your 18 and six cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your plants are back in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then up pot them to the appropriate pot
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you've got several left,
go smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got a few left,
go larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an indoor environment, in a tent like
this, there's probably no reason to go
[SPEAKER_00]: larger than a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done seven gallon pots indoors in a
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to put them into flower
and then bring them back once you see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a five gallon pot would be
suitable for your big photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three gallons are probably more
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a three gallon if I'm using a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A smaller pot, smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need big gigantic plants in a
little grow hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a three or five gallon pot should be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of plants, you could go
even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go one gallon pots and you'd be
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your other question was,
have you heard of Bloom City Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I am not familiar with that
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no input on that part of your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also say, thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, tell Larry OG,
hello for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Larry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give Larry OG a fist bump the next
time I'm in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lone Stard, thanks for listening.
