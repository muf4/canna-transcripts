[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Podcast World, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 497 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this episode is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at
www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me on today's podcast,
to my left is White Mike, and right in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of me is Double Door Dank,
also known as Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking stoned, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having us, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually start the podcast off by talking
about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had kind of a buffet of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lots of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A buffet of flowers and concentrates,
a smorgasbord, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all nice and baked here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that I just took a dab of that
really stood out to me was the Fuzzy Navel
[SPEAKER_02]: Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a cross of Jilly 13 and Peach Oz.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the package, the flavor is described as
orange push pop and peach daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely got the orange push pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure about the peach daiquiri
because I don't drink, so I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_02]: what that tastes like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some peach in there on the
afterglow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The afterglow, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm digging that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got afterglow in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but the Fuzzy Navel from Green
Dot Labs, that's the orange push pop and
[SPEAKER_02]: peach daiquiri.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the back of the package, it says the
product contains 63.93% THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm popping it open right now to give
myself a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like orange rinds and candy
coming out of the package.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs
for the Fuzzy Navel Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also smoking some flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do those flowers have a name, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I try to tell somebody what the
cross is, they keep calling it motorboat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're just going motorboat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked something called motorboat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been dubbed the motorboat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice official announcement, motorboat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that now and later and motor breath?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm digging that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice ... That's the one we
spoke of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the grape leather flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of searching to get something
unique in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that actually stuck
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the culmination of my year of hard
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great find, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in the room is nicely stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's just smiling at the microphone
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just enjoy when a year of hard work can
end up in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something cool has happened over the last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in the room got to enjoy the
hard work they came out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the room still smells like that mason
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed the leathery,
peach, whatever smell you get from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep smoking it, dude, so we must like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You left me a bag of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke a lot of flowers,
but I'm smoking through that bag that you
[SPEAKER_02]: left me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep a bowl of it sitting around so that
sometimes if I'm just passing from room to
[SPEAKER_02]: room and I walk by the table where the
bowl is, I just pick it up and hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep the buzz going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple of great friends here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very experienced grower and another
semi-experienced grower, but two qualified
[SPEAKER_02]: people to be on an episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, let's talk a little bit
about lollipopping our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little technique that I call
bottoming the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll also talk about what we call
shaving the legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all got the same idea behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump right into a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about bottoming,
lollipopping and shaving the legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about why we want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the point of, and we'll talk more
about what bottoming and lollipopping and
[SPEAKER_02]: shaving the legs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the basics of what we're going
to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we want to do this sort of
technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: In a small grow, in a large grow,
in any type of grow environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: much of the stuff on the bottom of your
plant, unless maybe you're running a
[SPEAKER_02]: coliseum grow, much of the crap on the
bottom isn't going to be a very useful
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be very productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not ending up with an A or a B
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be the stuff that ends up
in the trim bin that you're going to turn
[SPEAKER_02]: into concentrates or that you'll make
edibles out of that you'll be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is so small and annoying to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about stuff whose,
whose final potential is at best a C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just, it's so much easier to
just remove it from the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way early before it even has a chance to
be part of the equation and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: even help the buds up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the plants only got so much,
you know, it can only eat so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can only dedicate so much energy to
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're taking away energy,
it could be spending growing a C quality
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom nug to a cola up top by all means
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got the right idea and we're not
going to get light down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why those buds are going to be
crappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be any light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light gets stopped by every leaf,
every bud on the way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time we get down there to the
bottom, you just got a little popcorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it larf where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a different name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a different name in every circle,
but it's larf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little fluffy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also by taking off a lot of the
unnecessary crap, we increase the airflow
[SPEAKER_02]: and by increasing airflow, we increase the
overall health of the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reduce the likelihood of a number of
negative events.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We reduce humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We reduce respiration and transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: We reduce the opportunity for powdery
mildew with less foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are less places for pests to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also it is easier and more effective when
we do apply a pesticide if we're applying
[SPEAKER_02]: a spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even stupid stuff like you can see better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get to the pot and water it
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see if the spray nozzle is on your
watering system or functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of strain specific too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of those things where you
want to know the plant you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the first time you do it,
you don't go as hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go light and slowly work up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't glue leaf back on, but you can
take off more tomorrow or the day after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got that written down on how
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strain dependent and it's also
environmentally dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a room with a lot of light,
you're going to produce more leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to produce more branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to cut off more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got big pots, you're going to
produce bigger plants with more shit to
[SPEAKER_02]: cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something like an OG Kush
that grows like kind of lanky,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to want to take off as
much shit off the bottom because you won't
[SPEAKER_02]: leave as much stuff up the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something like strawberry
starburst, she gets branchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably take off quite a bit of
that bottom stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very environment dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got weak lights, you don't want
to take off as much, or you may need to
[SPEAKER_02]: take off even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get as much growth,
but you're also not going to get as much
[SPEAKER_02]: light penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I take this off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I leave it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the light going to get to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a decision to be made when it
comes to bottoming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that pretty soon,
but we want to kind of clean up the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what I mean by
lollipopping and bottoming and shaving the
[SPEAKER_02]: legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically all the same thing,
but slightly different variations of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same words.
[SPEAKER_02]: By bottoming, I mean, so you've got a
plant that's growing naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a- Kind of looks like a Christmas
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of looks like a Christmas tree,
but on the bottom, you've got multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: branches coming out and then up higher,
you got more branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those bottom branches are probably thin
and wispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of them are kind of
substantial, but you can see where the
[SPEAKER_02]: light doesn't get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take those branches off the bottom,
you don't waste that energy like we were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about earlier, weight growing
those bottom buds that aren't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: amount to anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can put the energy from that
plant up to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've still got the same root space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to feed the same amount of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if I just took your backpack off
of you and told you to run laps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have that backpack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to make that plant a
little bit more high performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's basically bottoming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that crap off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when I talk about lollipopping,
there are a couple that's kind of the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing as bottoming, but I like to work my
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of determine how far the light is
going to penetrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a little defoliation so I can see
where the light gets down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm looking at my plant and I see the
light doesn't get to about this branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any branch below there, it's coming off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then branches that reach or branches that
have potential to get up to the light,
[SPEAKER_02]: I clean them up to where just the tips may
have some leaves at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel afraid to have a naked branch
with just a tip if the tips are reaching
[SPEAKER_02]: up to where they will get enough light.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're hanging a trellis, I basically
lollipop everything below the first net.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important in developing
your canopy, especially if you want a
[SPEAKER_00]: really even canopy where everything comes
out consistent all the way across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipopping up is going to really
increase your upper canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How this works in practice really depends
on your growth style and method and your
[SPEAKER_01]: plans for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much you cut off, when and how and why
you do it, all is about your goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all got the right idea to just clean
up that bottom part and get more energy up
[SPEAKER_02]: to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, like you said, it will help work on
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all want that even canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us want a nice even canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a commercial environment, that big one
giant glory bud, that donkey dick to take
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of, that's useless.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a bunch of usable product that is
very uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got one big bud, you've got
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get mold in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get mildew in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want a bunch of consistent buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spread it out using a screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use one screen to spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant's growing straight up and
branching straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put a screen down.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those branches that are going straight
up, I would spread them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of going straight up, now they've
got some horizontal growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The net slows them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they fill more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of going up, you've got more
square footage wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put that first net down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them grow up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them grow into the second net and then
flower them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything below that first net,
you've got what I call little sucker buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little finger size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their shoots is what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little worthless shoots that aren't
going to measure up to much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's smaller than a pencil in a
commercial grow, I basically cut it off of
[SPEAKER_02]: the main branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got branches that come up from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the non-substantial branches come
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You leave the main branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way up to where the light happens,
you take off all that sucker crap and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I give you, or what we call in
a commercial environment, nice-looking
[SPEAKER_02]: shaved legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just see those sexy stalks,
those nice shaved legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then your canopy makes a skirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing your canopy across there is
just going to give you that consistency in
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower stuff is never going to help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to get the light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think of it like the old slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slab windows where they close with a
little draw string.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it works like blinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your fan leaves are blocking out a lot of
that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting through to those bottom
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're doing vertical growing like
where I'm doing, they'll open up and
[SPEAKER_00]: direct themselves towards the light and
work themselves towards whichever
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing standard canopy and
training, you're going to get a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: success from your top end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that you can't glue shit back on
once you cut it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always recommend, if you're going to
try a new technique or a new product,
[SPEAKER_01]: to try it on one or two plants and wait
for a few days or a week and see how that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant reacts rather than do it to the
whole garden and come in tomorrow morning
[SPEAKER_01]: to realize you read the label wrong and
know all your plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to setting yourself up for
success too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those steps you're doing in
preparation for a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you go to flip,
everything is just going to be spot on and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even do some of that in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is just preparation so the
plant can develop to be exactly what you
[SPEAKER_00]: intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that in mind, you've got to think
about what is this plant going to look
[SPEAKER_02]: like in three days?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it going to look like in a week?
[SPEAKER_02]: What will it look like in 10 days or two
weeks because of what I'm doing right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pull off those little shoots,
those won't grow back.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you cut off those branches,
they will not grow back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants grow from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the new growth comes out of the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect anything down on the bottom
to replace itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people thought, well,
won't that stuff grow back?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you cut it off, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is gone for good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not familiar with the cannabis
plant and you're totally lost right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're talking about is taking a plant
that wants to grow like a Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_01]: and making it grow like a menorah with the
goal of an increased overall harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically in a commercial environment,
when we move the plants into the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: they start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a table and the table is filled
with three gallon pots that are in nice
[SPEAKER_02]: straight lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look down the row, you can't see
through the row to the other end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get done bottoming and lollipopping
and shaving the legs, it's like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see all the way down to the other
end of that table.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a good 12 to 16, maybe 18
inch gap where you could just see nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: but sexy looking shaved legs and
irrigation lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scene in the horror movie where the
lights kind of on and off and the scary
[SPEAKER_01]: thing moves real fast up the hallway like
in chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either the lights are going off and it's
getting darker coming close to you or the
[SPEAKER_01]: scary things running at you like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things in a grow like
filling up a room with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always take pictures that made it
look like the plants were rushing up
[SPEAKER_01]: behind me like that filling up or going
through and lollipopping a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the first day, you can see the first
four rows deep and by the end of the week,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see all the way through the
fucking big room and it's weird because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can never see all the way through the
big room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you duck down right now,
you can see like 200 yards down the row.
[SPEAKER_02]: People just went 200 yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: How big is your grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see some of the shit we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always laugh when I read about big
busts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw one that the cops had online
where it was literally eight one gram
[SPEAKER_01]: baggies of weed on the table and they were
like busting another one going into
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever venue and I was like,
oh dude, I could just post some pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: from work where there's more keef than
that on a tray that's about to get swept
[SPEAKER_01]: into the hash bag just because that's what
we do with it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you guys doing out there on the
East Coast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on now, catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, you're going to get some
hate mail coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bail you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in the quicksand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to get more airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to move that crap that the
plants would grow on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to basically cut that off and
put that energy up the top so we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: those big, fat, juicy buds that we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to spread that out with the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, I do recommend a bottoming and
lollipopping and shaving the legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes the room look better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it easier to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want leaves hanging down on the
pots and in the soil anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just helps you out getting bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: By cleaning up the inside, you help get
airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps you prevent bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also helps move that energy out to the
ends of the plants to get you bigger,
[SPEAKER_02]: fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty simple technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to take off anything that
you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: The branching, you have to be selective
with the branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decide what branches you want to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always take more off later.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't look like it's going to be
worth the shit, cut it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do this and we're going to talk
about timing next.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do this into flower so you don't
have to make your decision today.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those little suckers that are just
little tiny shoots, take those off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically anything on the bottom third of
the plant or so can be removed if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go up high doing this
kind of stuff on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'll stunt the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start taking off potential bud
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the stuff on the bottom, feel free to
go ahead and chop that off of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you might want to start light the
first time and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like Mike said, maybe a fuck one plant
up on a level 10, fuck one up level seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go a little lighter on each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go hard on your first try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go slow and learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you are going to top your plants,
a lot of people like to top.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next episode will be about topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's write that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about topping the
plants in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But top them first because think about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you bought them, you lollipop,
and then you top them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you already kind of fucked up the
height of your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took off too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So top them first.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good idea that we should mention
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top them before you do bottom and
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe put them in the trellis before you
do the bottom and lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this part is kind of up for a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I'm talking about people have
their own method and a different approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will say that they do it a
different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most debatable part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The when to do the bottoming, the
lollipopping, and the shaving of the legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do this just before flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can do this all the way up to the
start of week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can start at the beginning of
flower and continue all the way into the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of depends on what you want
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've taken some off and you realize,
oh, those plants got much larger after
[SPEAKER_02]: they went into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can probably clean them up more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull off the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can clean that shit up all the way
into week three without causing too much
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to take off a full branch at
some point, you're not going to harm the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant just by whacking one off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're worried too about how
the plant's going to react to your
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation techniques, being in veg when
you do it can be a little safer of a
[SPEAKER_00]: technique because you can give it more of
a chance to bounce back from any damage
[SPEAKER_00]: you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're a first timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I'm not sure how much to
take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a little worried about that,
just try to take off some of the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and kind of work your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with experience, you'll get more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get an idea of what the shape you
expect from your plant for your
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll learn how to start shaping
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can start kind of working
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm saying now to do this right
before flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get better at shaping the plant,
you can do it earlier in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And earlier in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can start shaping that plant
exactly how you want it from early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the time you get a clone started,
you can say, oh, I'm going to want these
[SPEAKER_02]: branches gone for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to want these branches here for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by removing a bunch of the shit
from the bottom early on, you actually do
[SPEAKER_02]: the same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You send that up to the top in veg as
well, because you're not wasting crap on
[SPEAKER_02]: that bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not wasting nutrients, energy,
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spraying, you're not wasting all
that crap on the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead and pull that stuff off,
send some energy up to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That part down on the bottom part of the
plant that just looks like, it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: a chia pet growing on your fucking weed
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the spider mites want to hang
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the powdery mildew wants to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the thrips want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I hear people talking themselves
into keeping it is they go, it's hash
[SPEAKER_01]: mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be hash mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be hash mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be plenty of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please just get, you will be happier with
yourself if you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of times if you have genetics
that you aren't too sure about,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking off some of those can be a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea as well because
generally they like to herm towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't sure if the genetics are
going to be solid or not, taking off some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those lower inners can kind of be a
lifesaver for not pollinating out your
[SPEAKER_00]: entire flower room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you, if it's going to be a
herm, it'll show you that down lower where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you see the herm parts for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which it'll still like, if it's going to
herm, it's going to herm, but that might
[SPEAKER_00]: buy you some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to see it if it's not
down there in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I always laugh, the day after a big
defoliation run was always, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found six sprayer heads that are
clogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see everything better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get in and work your plant better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant gets more light on every piece
that's growing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what you're doing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see your equipment better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many benefits to this,
so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people do some really amazing
things with the cannabis plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoming topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scrogging, lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it grow long and down a row
where one plant grows halfway down a
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just every couple of feet, another branch
goes up and it keeps moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just every summer or every day that
summer, the grower went out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbed the top and dunked it under the
next rung of the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take your time, you can work this
plant into any shape or mold you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: fit your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to take your time and
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes back to knowing your space,
like you just said, knowing what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with and what you're trying to
accomplish in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a plant that's going to be
really short and squatty and bushy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can accomplish that even with a strain
that isn't going to naturally want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that just by training it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bend and pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all kinds of topping stuff
we'll talk about in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got popping and twisting in another
episode coming up, so yeah, good hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of techniques you can do to
really make this plant into anything you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've run a strand a couple of grows
in a row and really got a feel for how the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant grows, you can find ways to maximize
that strain in your space with your
[SPEAKER_01]: method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some growers do some really
beautiful things with this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: so play with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For new growers, a lot of people will
successfully do this by setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: string so that way they can across their
canopy area where they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a more consistent all the way
through your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a trellis system, run one
string across the bottom, all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not getting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, take off everything below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be more consistent that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good way for new people
to get an idea, okay, this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: what I need to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like drawing a chalk line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main idea is to take off all that crop
off the bottom, increase airflow,
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do it basically about the
bottom third.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it starting early or late in
veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can continue to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend a nice bottoming,
lollipopping, and cleaning up about the
[SPEAKER_02]: second week of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where your little bud sites
are going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see which bud sites are going to
be worth the shit and what's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in there and just take off anything
that you think is a waste of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: a waste of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it won't turn into a bud that is worth
trimming, you probably don't want it on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your goal, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, in a commercial
environment, if it's not at least as big
[SPEAKER_02]: as my pinky or my thumb, we don't trim
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That becomes concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about that when it comes to
taking stuff off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put shit back, but you can
always take more off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see that a branch just isn't
performing, you've got those little
[SPEAKER_02]: branches that just stick up in the middle
of the plant, feel free to take those off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see that it increases airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants will just look happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like a happier, cleaner
canopy in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's not for you, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's simply how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a defoliation first, clean up the
bottoms, and then if you're going to top,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you top first also because you
don't want to bottom and then expect to
[SPEAKER_02]: have another foot that you just cut off
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll throw you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got any more input before we
start wrapping up this episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we gave a pretty decent lesson
on bottoming our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with strain-dependent,
I've also had strains where they golf ball
[SPEAKER_00]: out real hard and they stretch their arms
in a way that you don't have to defoliate
[SPEAKER_00]: or take off as much of the lowers because
they all just golf ball up into nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: big, dense nugs all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains are rare and you don't come
across ones that grow in that pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some ghost OG and ghost dog sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely try different techniques with
whatever you're working with and get
[SPEAKER_00]: proficient in that because just the
experience is going to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: overall growth knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happiness, experience, harvest,
yield, potency, all of the above will
[SPEAKER_02]: increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all stoned too, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to bail this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symmetry and getting a good, equal
defoliation through your grow is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this become a major problem and
grows as small as four lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got three or five gallon pots
and the plants get to a decent size and
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to defoliate, you're talking about
several hours of the work, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of lollipop and whatnot you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first plant gets a perfect,
exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second plant gets about the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third plant gets 85%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last plant gets 25% of what you
intended to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That causes all sorts of weird problems in
your grow from air flow and light problems
[SPEAKER_01]: to little pest concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to make it even, even if that means
giving the first plant an 80 so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can give all the plants in the room an 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back tomorrow and do the last 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another thing people miss is when
you first transplant into a one or three
[SPEAKER_00]: or five gallon, you're going to have a lot
of lower stuff on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go ahead and take a lot of that
lower stuff off in veg that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the soil because that stuff's going
to be bad for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things in your soil that
you don't want getting systemic into your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and take all that stuff off that
it looks like it's going to touch the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or could potentially touch the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, go ahead and start taking some
of that lower foliage off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start cleaning it up and you'll start
sending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all that stuff that you're feeding
the plants has to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got little straggler shoots and
leaves that you don't need, you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: that energy in a better spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, it's like taking off
your backpack or if you're taking off crap
[SPEAKER_02]: on the bottom, it's like taking off your
shackles or your ankle weights or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: just a heavy anklet or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe taking off those baggy Genco jeans
that Mike wears, giving the ability to run
[SPEAKER_02]: a little faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't run in these visits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can't run in those.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I gave you running shoes and shorts,
are you still going to run?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able, but usually unwilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need four dogs and two cops if we need
Mike to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also sucker branches, I call them on the
bottoms that you'll have where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: almost tempted to keep them where they
kind of go halfway up the plant and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, it might do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and get rid of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it does stretch, you're just
potentially taking away from all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that could have done way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need a stick or something to
hold it up anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't waste your time with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of what we said, like we keep
talking about is strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants are going to love this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants won't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also environment dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a lot of light, you're going
to produce more plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have more shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you're going to have more canopy
penetration, so you'll have to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: equation on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I take this off?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do I take off?
[SPEAKER_02]: When do I stop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, I keep saying it,
you can always cut more off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any plant glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to glue those branches
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't want to be messing with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to glue shit back onto
your cannabis plant, you have gone into a
[SPEAKER_01]: sad and strange place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some angry trollers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a safety meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to glue shit back on,
it's time for a safety meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some angry trollers fingers just blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant grafting, plant grafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, you could do with apple
trees, but you don't want to do it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 day harvesting plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite things to do is in a
trim room when right after I cut down a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of plants, like a whole room,
a hundred plants, I take a couple out to
[SPEAKER_02]: the trimmers and I get them going and then
I'll get them trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let them trim for an hour or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I always go check on
the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll walk up and I'll pick a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like trimmed and I'll look at it and
I'll look mad and I'll go, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, plants aren't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all give me this, what the fuck
kind of a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to mess with trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun and metric people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, here's another fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you work in the cannabis regulated
cannabis industry and you've got plant
[SPEAKER_02]: tags that are required to be on your
plants, walk out of a room with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and find your compliance person or
the person in charge of the tags and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: why don't any of the plants in that room
have tags?
[SPEAKER_02]: And watch the look on their face because
those plants must have tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't have tags, they're going
to get fired and we're going to get a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of fines and to watch them frantically
piss their pants and try to figure out how
[SPEAKER_02]: to tag 300 plants right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a funny thing to play on
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like walking into the dry room and
going, so I guess we're not taking any
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh frozen this round, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And watching the trim manager freak the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an inside industry joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always sublime in the trim room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're wondering, all right,
I feel like we had fun in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, that look on your face, Mike,
that's priceless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we had fun at the end of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: People got to learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with my bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got plenty stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time to start wrapping it up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to start wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, what is, you got to say,
you got something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we choose the next episode coming
up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do you, how do you know when it's
coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the numbers are sequential.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't pick a random number.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at 97 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting close.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting close to 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 500 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to get all the crew, the gang,
the gang gang, the boys, the iry army,
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow from your heart squad over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boys together and mash through some
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like, yeah, it's going to
be like getting the band back together,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a pretty good idea of what
should happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be a good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big 500, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us for 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you can't get too hype right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try not to get too hype for the future
coming up because, no, join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 500 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one will come out the weekend that we
are at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't say there's another big thing
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, it looks like white Mike will be
at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking like I'm going to be at the
Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you make it, bro, because you're
like my partner in crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I make it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't make it, I'm going to be like
in the hospital or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like either that's why I didn't make it or
I ended up there when you got back on
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday and we were like, fucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Endo Expo in Denver, Colorado,
at the Denver Mart on January 25th and
[SPEAKER_02]: 26th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Saturday event is what they call
industry insider day or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have a business,
something to get in on that day.
