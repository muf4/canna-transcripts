[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 397 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Lemon G
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this contains 64.4%
THC and 74% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part about the Lemon G is the
disgustingly delicious flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gross and delicious all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like Lemon G with armpits and onions
on top of it, and for some reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking the Lemon G Ambrosia from
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me nice and talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me really chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my brain in a nice flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be all about what
I call the Colorado Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is the Colorado Crunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to Colorado and you shop in a
Colorado dispensary, most of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to be served what is known
as the Colorado Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis community around the
nation, Colorado is laughed at because
[SPEAKER_00]: most of our product is way too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in the environment in which we are
in, that is hard to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a very high altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, all of the buds that are in
that environment are going to become dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand being a commercial
cultivator and somebody who takes pride in
[SPEAKER_00]: my work and takes pride in my final
product and wants to deliver the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that the Colorado Crunch
can be an issue for a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also understand how and why it's
happening and I see the chain of command
[SPEAKER_00]: that is creating this Colorado Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the Colorado Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the Colorado Crunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Crunch is what I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come to Colorado and you shop at
one of our dispensaries and you buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: product and you go somewhere safe and you
attempt to smoke that product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you put it in the grinder and you
go to grind it, instead of grinding it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a nice rollable consistency,
it basically just turns into a dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy, crunchy powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I call the Colorado Crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an ideal environment, that herb would
be a little bit sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have a little bit of moisture to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put it in the grinder,
it would feel a little bit sticky as you
[SPEAKER_00]: twist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take that material out of the
grinder, it would stick to your fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you roll it, it would have a
little bit of fluff to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you went to smoke it,
it would have a nice, delicious,
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth, full flavor to it that tasted like
a freshly rolled joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of what is sold to
customers in Colorado is way too dry to be
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, once your herb gets that dry,
it grinds up like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns up when you try to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it doesn't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have dried out all of the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the flavor is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now instead of smoking what could have
been connoisseur quality product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're now just smoking like a seven out
of a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now being the lead cultivator,
I would like to deliver a 10 to the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not satisfied with putting 70% of my
quality out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want 100% of the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name, my face, and my reputation are on
the line when it comes to that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know which grows and which
dispensaries I am affiliated with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will shop at those stores just
because they know I grew that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's embarrassing to me to know that
we're putting out 70% of what we could be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to deliver a 100% top shelf
quality product to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to talk a little bit about
what happens to the product from the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it leaves the commercial cultivation
facility to the time it finally reaches
[SPEAKER_00]: the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most large commercial cultivation
facilities, there is a person in charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is that person's duty to make sure that
product is dried and cured properly and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it never becomes too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side of that token,
part of their job is also to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that herb doesn't stay wet too long and
stay sealed in a container too long and
[SPEAKER_00]: become moldy or funky and ruin the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a lot of responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of their big responsibilities is to
maintain correct moisture of finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the facilities which I operate,
we do that by keeping a dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: running constantly and a humidifier
running constantly and we set them both at
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% and we seal a room and we let them
battle it out at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that room is constantly at 50%
humidity, which keeps our buds at a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on how much product there
is, the buds will be kept in different
[SPEAKER_00]: size containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there is a lot, we use very large,
like rubber-made storage containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get down to smaller batches,
we use smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get down to the pound level,
we start using turkey bags actually and we
[SPEAKER_00]: seal the turkey bags up and those turkey
bags and all of those packages are still
[SPEAKER_00]: kept in that room, which is maintained at
50% relative humidity at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while any flower is in my possession in
any facility, in which I am responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for, we are very careful to maintain the
correct humidity and moisture levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: our flowers at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people may say that herb is
going to sit there in that dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: room for a long time and it's just gonna
get funky waiting, but that is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, cannabis is in high
demand, recreationally and medically,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a high demand for quality
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I determine the flowers are
ready for the shelf, the store will take
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that delivery immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower is not sitting around at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we don't have any space to
store bulk flower in most commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, it's in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no back stock at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get that product from us to
the store on the shelf to the consumer in
[SPEAKER_00]: a pipe and keep the cycle moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no back stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sitting around getting dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no opportunity for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we harvest a crop, it is
basically sold and then all of the trim
[SPEAKER_00]: material is immediately sent off to a
concentrate company to be turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't sit on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need quick returns in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is the bud crunchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still haven't gotten to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, this product has to leave
my custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got to leave the commercial
cultivation facility where it is kept in
[SPEAKER_00]: that controlled environment at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is transferred to the retail location
and that is where I feel the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, the dispensary will
place an order from the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, hey, we see you've got this
in stock on your spreadsheet because I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a spreadsheet of my entire inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll say, hey, we need this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this conversation, we're going to say
they just ordered two pounds of Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send us two pounds of Golden Goat with the
next order.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more stuff in that
order, but we're going to stick with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat for this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, the person in charge of
the product in our facility will weigh two
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll package it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give it a package number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be all marked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be all sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will go with the delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets taken to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is at a store without a controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just in the store environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably whatever it is in the room,
77, 78 degrees, whatever ambient humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got in that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that product is now stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably in a back stock room,
just chilling out on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows if the budtender or whoever is
responsible for the product there knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need to reseal that bag when
they're done pulling out whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where it is stored?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sitting right by the heater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sitting right by the air
conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea, nor do I have any control
over what happens to this product once it
[SPEAKER_00]: has entered the dispensary and it has left
my custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I did mention that there's not
much back stock and that we're not hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: on to a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do deliver enough product to last about
a week so we don't have to keep making
[SPEAKER_00]: deliveries every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a little bit of excess
product in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is probably that bag of two pounds
of Golden Goat sitting somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what will happen is an employee will
get the jar that is on display,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will take that to the stock room,
and they will fill it up with as much
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat fits in that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of this conversation,
we're going to say that jar probably holds
[SPEAKER_00]: two ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna pull out of that 32 ounce
bag I just sent them, they're gonna pull
[SPEAKER_00]: two ounces and put that in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That jar is now going to go on display.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said earlier, who knows what
happens to that big two pound surplus bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they seal it back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they leave it wide open?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problem of the Colorado
Crunch begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we've got the big bulk
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got about 30 ounces remaining in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in a store room somewhere that I
can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the Colorado Crunch is
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about this display jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've pulled out two ounces and it is on
display.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoppers are going to come in all day and
they're going to see the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's what happens in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in, you look at the jars,
you see the labels, something gets your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention and then you start by saying,
can I smell the whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pick a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this conversation, I'm going with my
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The budtender will turn around,
grab the jar, get the Golden Goat off the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar or off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will pop the lid of that jar and
let you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it depends on how busy your specific
dispensary is, but imagine how many times
[SPEAKER_00]: in one day that jar is going to be opened
and closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You close the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of moisture in that
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be moisture in the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is properly dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we seal it up, that moisture starts
to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to even itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to redistribute all through that
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got one bud in there that's
kind of wet and one bud that's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to kind of even each other
out inside the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture is going to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture will also be in the air
inside the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be moving around in the
environment, in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the jar, we crack open the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now guess what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the moisture goes flying right out of
the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stick it up to the customer's nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take an eighth of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The budtender pulls out an eighth,
3.5 grams, throw it into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: container, seal it up, put the jar,
put the lid back on the jar, put the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: back on the shelf, ask you what else you'd
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that process happens to that jar over
and over and over again all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they shop from it or not, they may
choose not to even buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got the moisture built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got cracked open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It let the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it got resealed so it can repeat the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens all day, every day until
all of that product is sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that dispensaries like to
do, it looks way better to have full jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks better on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a retail manager, we like to see full
jars instead of half empty jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that jar starts to look a little
empty, about halfway, most retail managers
[SPEAKER_00]: will send a budtender to refill that jar
so it looks like you've got big,
[SPEAKER_00]: full, fresh jars and it looks like you've
got a lot of product and it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happened to that product on the
bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been getting open and closed for even
longer now and it's just going to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to sit there on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a lot of what is contributing
to the Colorado crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I try very hard to prevent
crunchy herb in the commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to maintain a perfect environment
in a very large room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require a little bit of equipment
and it requires a lot of attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, but I feel like I do a very good
job at delivering a properly dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to pass the buck,
but I feel many commercial cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: take as much pride in their product as I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like this Colorado crunch is
happening after the product leaves the
[SPEAKER_00]: custody of the grower at the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it is happening in the back of
the store and it is greatly happening
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that jar being opened and
closed all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my explanation of the Colorado
crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I can fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I can do anything
about, but I hope I taught you guys about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you understand what the crunch is
and I hope you understand why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and I hope you see that I
understand that it's an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also understand that it is beyond my
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have a solution to the Colorado
crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of podcaster would I be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of commercial consultant would I
be if I just came and told you about a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, but I did not offer any type of
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have what I feel is a good solution,
but what I have noticed is consumers do
[SPEAKER_00]: not like this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the solution to the
Colorado crunch is pre-weighed and
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-packaged products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had everything pre-weighed and
pre-packaged, we wouldn't be opening that
[SPEAKER_00]: big jar all day every day and we would be
able to maintain the proper dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture level that we deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ideal scenario would be that we've got
a small jar of each offering available on
[SPEAKER_00]: the counter that you can look at at your
own leisure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just grab the jar, pop the lid,
give it a smell, and if you want an eighth
[SPEAKER_00]: of that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I've got to do is turn around and grab
a pre-packaged eighth off of the shelf and
[SPEAKER_00]: hand it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be advantageous in a couple of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, it would save budtenders time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The budtender wouldn't have to weigh out
your eighth while you're standing there
[SPEAKER_00]: staring at me and I've got a line of
customers behind you that also would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to get an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pre-weighed eighth would make it
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, I want golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reach back, golden goat, bro,
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies offer nitrogen-sealed
cannabis in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any problem with it because it
keeps the herb deliciously fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get too dry in that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get funky in that container and
it is just as good as it was when the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower sealed it up when he felt it was
perfectly dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a pre-weighed product is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason a lot of people don't like
the pre-weighed product is because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are old school and they don't trust the
person who is selling them their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is a retail environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be there tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We paid a lot of money for all of our
licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a reputation to uphold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our name of our business is on a sign out
front of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to sell any of your
cannabis products to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: A short bag in the legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bag is going to weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your product will be what you expected it
to be, even if it was pre-weighed before
[SPEAKER_00]: you came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a packaging department.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire competent people to work in the
packaging department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their only job is to weigh eights all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put those eights in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seal it up, put a sticker on it,
put it in the bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, all of those eights
are delivered to the store and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be sold to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dispensaries are doing that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, it is the common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, you don't hear about the
California crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that pre-packaged eights and
quarters would be the way to go for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future to prevent the Colorado crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over time, consumers will become
more comfortable with being given a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-weighed eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now a lot of people still probably
get their package from the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people probably drive home and
dump their package right on a scale to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that it weighs and I'm sure that
all of those packages that you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: from a dispensary, I'm certain that they
all weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most bud tenders are hourly employees that
also get tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they give you good service and give you
a nice eighth, there's a good chance that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get home and see that nice
eighth, the next time you come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, you're going to give them a better
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they have no incentive to give you a
short bag because the product is owned by
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason they would want to short
you is because they don't want to sell all
[SPEAKER_00]: of their weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they short you half a gram here,
half a gram there, they can sell a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more grams, make a little bit more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not street dealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to make any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product, again, belongs to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are an hourly employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they don't put that half a gram or
whatever you think they're going to rip
[SPEAKER_00]: you off into your container, they don't
make anything off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to give you your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to keep shopping there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to develop a relationship with
you and they want you to start giving them
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that the dispensary is
going to short you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to keep shopping there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to keep selling them.
They want you to keep selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that really breaks my heart
is when somebody tells me that they tried
[SPEAKER_00]: a new strain, perhaps something I bred or
perhaps something they think I may have
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, and they tell me that they did not
like the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often feel like if they would have
purchased a gram or maybe an eighth,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have gotten a much better
representation of the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that I intended to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about pre-rolls and why
people complain about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember earlier, I was talking about that
display jar that we open and close all day
[SPEAKER_00]: and we just keep topping it off with fresh
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that stuff at the bottom,
it's really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the bottom popcorn buds
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where all the stuff that nobody
really wants to purchase ends up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that super dry, super crunchy,
super tiny shit all ends up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the dispensary is slow and the bud
tender doesn't have anything to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll grab that jar of bottom dried up
crunchy popcorn buds and they'll pour it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a colander or a strainer and they'll
use that to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crunch it up real fine and real small
so that the buds fit through the colander
[SPEAKER_00]: or the strainer and all of the stems and
the junk stay in the strainer so it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that fine, dusty, crunchy material is
used to roll all of the pre-rolls that go
[SPEAKER_00]: on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time somebody complains about
a pre-roll, just remember it's because you
[SPEAKER_00]: are buying the very bottom of the barrel
literally and it is also the cheapest item
[SPEAKER_00]: on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want a good
representation of a strain, don't buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll if it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of dispensaries offer
strain-specific pre-rolls, meaning you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go in and look at the menu and get a
Golden Goat pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can get a Lemon Jeffery
pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's a Lemon Jeffery or a Golden
Goat, I still suggest you get a gram or
[SPEAKER_00]: two and roll it up yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant on pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I want to bash is caviar or
whatever they call it in your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really popular for people to take
buds small buds, like one gram size buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they roll it around in what they
call honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's butane honey oil, B-H-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it's rolled around in the B-H-O
and it's nice and sticky, they coat it in
[SPEAKER_00]: keif.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, I am always
very suspect of caviar.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, why did you want to hide your bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know why they hid the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the bud that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did they want to cover that up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people want to show off their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you hiding the buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's something to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first suspicion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, why did you hide the oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: You rolled it in oil and made it nice and
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of makes me question the
consistency and the quality of your oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you coated that oil in keif.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just seems like you had a bunch
of shit that wasn't really up to par and
[SPEAKER_00]: you thought you could take three low grade
products and combine them and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make one high grade product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I'm just not buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am always very suspicious of the caviar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's three products that were
all problematic that were just combined
[SPEAKER_00]: and put into one product so they could put
it on the shelf and get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: return on an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion on the moon rocks
and caviar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been really impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always found it a pain in the ass to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when you hide your buds,
I immediately wonder what you're hiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with the quality of the
flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with the quality of the oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did you put a bunch of keif over
all of it to hide it all from me?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough bashing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bashed pre-rolls and I bashed
caviar pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to be negative Nancy on the
podcast, but that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give you a heads up as a
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it is partly my responsibility
to look out for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more quick thing I want to
talk about since I'm looking out for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look out for the people who work in
the grows and in the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick rant that I've wanted to
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in the legal cannabis
industry, I highly suggest that you look
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rules the laws and regulations
involving your position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you are not doing anything that
can put yourself in legal jeopardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, if you do break the law at
work under somebody else's direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still be arrested for a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a bud tender and you
accidentally sell product to somebody with
[SPEAKER_00]: an invalid license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: A customer walks in and they hand their
driver's license to the person at the
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a familiar customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person at the door looks at the ID
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture looks right, says Bill,
that's Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your ID back Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buzz you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into the bud room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill walks into the bud room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You as a bud tender, you say, hey Bill,
how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill has been there frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know what Bill is going to
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes there so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say the usual Bill and he says,
yes ma'am or yes sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you serve Bill right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give Bill product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take Bill's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have just committed a crime
because you did not check Bill's ID
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that Bill's ID is
valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that ID is expired or invalid for any
reason, you just made an illegal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sale and you can be arrested and charged
with a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that sounds like a very minor
infraction, a very small detail at work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a very serious matter,
which is why I felt like, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was my responsibility to make sure you
are aware that you can be arrested and
[SPEAKER_00]: charged with a crime if you make a mistake
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this applies for almost any position
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody in the industry from an hourly
paid bud tender all the way up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: salaried dispensary owner can be charged
with a crime if they are found to be
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you work in the industry,
I highly suggest you learn all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules, all of the laws and all of the
regulations around your position.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a bud tender, get very familiar
with which forms of ID are acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a bud tender, get very familiar
with transaction limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small details like that can really keep
you out of trouble and it is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to think that that
responsibility falls on the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: owner or your boss or whoever you'd like
to call that person, but it is not their
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got that marijuana enforcement
division badge, you signed up and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the rules and I'm willing to play
by your rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, it is your
responsibility to know those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, learn the rules, learn the laws,
do a little bit of reading and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions in the state of
Colorado, we have got the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement division and metric at your
fingertips to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to keep you out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to keep you compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many facilities have a compliance
officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A compliance officer should have most of
the answers to all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, they should be familiar enough
with the rules to where they can skim
[SPEAKER_00]: right through the rule book and get to the
section that applies to what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they should be able to answer you in
just a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the rules, the setup,
the laws in your state, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is your responsibility to keep yourself
safe at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not commit a crime while trying to feed
yourself and your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have turned this into a legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do our best to stay out of trouble
while in the legal market.
