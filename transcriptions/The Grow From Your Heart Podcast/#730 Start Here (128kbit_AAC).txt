[SPEAKER_00]: We do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint does appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've been following along,
you may remember that recently I bought
[SPEAKER_00]: myself a new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recently my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did allocate a budget for myself to buy
a new dab rig for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a whole new setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two carb caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some turp pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even got a new torch and a new dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went all the way and I got a nice case
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to my friends at
positively vibes for the sweet hookup on
[SPEAKER_00]: the new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I did talk about how it was taking
me a moment, a few dabs to get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in, learning the new temperature of
the banger of a brand new banger,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning the, uh, when to drop the dab in,
when to cap it, uh, just learning the
[SPEAKER_00]: function of a brand new rig and getting
the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it took me a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a couple of days, maybe,
uh, three or four days to get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased, ordered, arrived, uh,
cleaned up and in use and in action and
[SPEAKER_00]: test it and see what I liked the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am happy to announce that I have gotten
my new dab rig dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits like a fucking Mac truck running
at a hundred miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has knocked me on my ass a couple of
times this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am happy to announce that rig works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
positively vibes for making sure I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to my shopping buddy,
the person that went with me that day to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I had a great birthday and a
great shopping experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's segue into a little bit more,
uh, cannabis related content.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I wanted to talk about
on this episode was simply be careful on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that there are several
Instagram accounts that are mimicking my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am I re underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only account that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast account.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the Rasta Jeff account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rarely log into those just once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I realize I've got so many messages I
should check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't check those very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am I re underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the other accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I read dot genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I re genetic dot S I'm none of
those accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those accounts have been attempting to
sell seeds to people on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for the scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one of the things I wanted to talk
about, somebody was telling me that they
[SPEAKER_00]: take great photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a great grower, but they are
afraid to post because of their location
[SPEAKER_00]: and their legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really want their face out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wanted their plants to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice to them was just don't post,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really are that worried about it,
if you're that sketched out about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no need to post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to put your face on
there, if you're not going to link up with
[SPEAKER_00]: people and do business through the
Instagram, which I don't recommend anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good way to get robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to get your money taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the buyer, the seller,
it will go wrong for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing drug deals on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not trying to do something
where you need to be known, remain
[SPEAKER_00]: anonymous, remain in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is a, uh, a free market grower
allegedly, and nothing he does,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, gets left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all goes somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, bro, don't even post to
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to open up that Pandora's
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not out there, don't be out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so be careful on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I wanted to segue into
is that our phones do put a lot of data in
[SPEAKER_00]: our photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take a picture of something,
uh, with our iPhone, with our,
[SPEAKER_00]: any phone where we're using basically now,
also our cameras will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a high quality camera that tells
me exactly where I was my coordinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I took that photo, your phone is
marking down exactly where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take that photo, you can go and
if you open up your photos and you search
[SPEAKER_00]: on the map section in your photos,
you can search via the map and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: locations where photos were taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can click on Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows all the pictures I took here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Denver a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see all the pictures I took in
Denver, all the pictures I took in
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder, all the pictures I took in
California, all the pictures I took in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see them all by category.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my Meow Wolf pictures are already
organized into a folder and I did not do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phone did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knew I was at Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful when you're taking pictures
because that data is stored in your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're going to do with
that photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have taken it, I don't know how
much of that data travels with that photo
[SPEAKER_00]: when you post it, but that data is in your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That data is there, that picture,
the location, the time, the coordinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that phone perhaps could land in the
wrong hands or that info could land in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong hands, it could get you in some sort
of trouble, especially if you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing where you're growing, when you're
growing, why you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't, again, I am not the computer
expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much comes along with
that photo when you post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Instagram gets the
metadata.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Facebook gets that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if cannabis gets that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of those servers where
we share our info, where we share the
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, I don't know if that they get the
data that is attached to that photo with
[SPEAKER_00]: the new photos app on the iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually click on the photo and
you can see all of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the location, the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see what settings my camera was on
when I took the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I dig deeper, I can probably see how
far the subject was away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my aperture setting was,
I can tell a lot of stuff just digging
[SPEAKER_00]: into the phone, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're going to take pictures
with your phone, if you're going to post
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, not all accounts are your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned there are fake accounts of my
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fake accounts of a lot of my
friends brands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of those people aren't real
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would it take for law enforcement
just to make an account that said,
[SPEAKER_00]: my name is whoever they wanted to be with
a cool, catchy name and just jump into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and they could, they could cause
you problems if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the other accounts that are not,
I read genetics are not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with email addresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be very careful where you were
purchasing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you check my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's official or go to my discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for a link that will send you to my
official vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are somewhere between eight and 12
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what we've got up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to do some editing soon,
some shifting, but my website has a list
[SPEAKER_00]: of official vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people do have actual, I read
genetics beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know they're selling you good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those companies have good customer
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying from anybody else,
I can't make you any promises on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can back up Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Dave's not here is a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are actually I read genetics beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other people that I may be
able to vouch for, but not, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're not on the website and I don't
say their name out loud at least a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times, I might not know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not be selling my real seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of brands, a couple of
companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just buy buckets of random seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in labels and tell you that
they're my brand and sell them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it to a lot of other famous,
uh, popular brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful where you are purchasing your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a correction to make in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about, uh, auto flower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about DAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a quick segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if I lost you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about DAS making auto flower
seeds with some I read genetics lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that episode, I mentioned that to the
best of my knowledge, it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately five or six filial
generations to create an auto flower line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after conversation with DAS,
I realized I'm wrong as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what I'm talking about
when it comes to auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've admitted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's not what I'm into, but DAS
says, uh, he can make auto flowers by the
[SPEAKER_00]: third generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be solid auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start popping up in the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be locked in by the third,
by that fourth generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I needed to correct that because I
misspoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, another thing I
should mention is in a previous episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that seeds here now was
getting a restock of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the United States postal service is
taking their sweet fucking time with those
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those, uh, packages have not arrived at
seeds here now.com at the time of this
[SPEAKER_00]: recording, they're still in transit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do ask you, my friends, please be
polite, please be gentle with seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now be patient with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order is on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes them a few minutes to check that
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some work to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just get checked in and sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's inventory things to be counted
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give my friends a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do want to sell you the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody makes money with seeds sitting in
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do want to sell them as soon as
they've got the seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take your money, but please,
maybe I spoke too soon saying that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of people message saying we
want them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry guys, not there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait patiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going and we're going to do
our best to not run out as frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things in place, making some upgrades and
some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient with my friends at seeds
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they don't have what you want,
if they don't have what you want in stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was harder to say than it looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they still don't, when they do get the
restock, if the pack you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get stocked message me,
I'll add that to my list and replenish
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making selections today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made selections for the outdoor breeding
run, which will happen this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not going to tell you what I
selected, but I am very excited to have
[SPEAKER_00]: made selections to put in the outdoor
breeding run this summer, fall season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leak some info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you guys know what's going on in
the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to say that I'm super excited
to have the outdoor plants prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of seeds, the feminized seed
project is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that recently I made a batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate spray, which I use to
reverse three female golden goat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three golden goat plants will be
used to pollinate a lemon skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, another golden goat,
also several other female plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room that don't need to be mentioned right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is that the reversal is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That female plant is starting to make
pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the male parts on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The balls are nice and big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're turning purple, doing exactly what
I want that golden goat plant to do at
[SPEAKER_00]: this phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, at this stage, the pollen
receiver plants have been dragged into the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now kicking into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not too far in there, but they're
starting to show me pre flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized project is well underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in, I don't want to say a
timeframe because you guys will hold me
[SPEAKER_00]: too closely to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need a few days worth of leeway,
some time here, some, uh, some buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The grace period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need a brief grace period.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the lemon, Jeffrey, orange,
gasm, golden goat, feminized and many
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fem seeds will be restocked here in a
short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once again, short time to a breeder is
not as much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys are going to think it's been
a long time, so be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fem seeds are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the reversal is looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat that I sprayed,
uh, every third day for up to day 21 at
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% dilution is the one that made,
uh, that will make the most pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like in my opinion, uh,
so far from what it looks like with my
[SPEAKER_00]: observations, but that is the one that
appears to be ready to make the most
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I did the mix just right,
sprayed just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to get the fem seeds made for
you guys, because you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are other fems, you guys,
there are other fems that will be dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not have said it on the show,
but the after glow S one will be available
[SPEAKER_00]: at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more long part that I want to
ramble about in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take some dabs and have a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with a friend recently at an
event and we were talking about setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: a brand new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was mentioning the parts,
the needs, the components, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the instructions and details of a grow,
I could watch my friend's eyes kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into the back of their head and their
face glazed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw them check out and I was like,
you good bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I can't afford half of the
shit that you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have half that much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, you know, it shouldn't
intimidate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is how you grow top shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cup winning, uh, medical grade,
perfect weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best weed you can grow with
all of these details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to start off growing cup
winning championship weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not start off growing cup
winning championship weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody starts off as a black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody starts off as a master.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to start off as a white belt in
any craft in which you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be a beginner, uh, or you're
going to fail later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't start off as a beginner,
learn the basic steps, the fundamentals,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll never get truly good at anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes when I'm talking about all of
the things that are needed to grow good
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, sometimes when I'm talking about
all of the equipment, the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purchases, the cost of entry,
uh, the time that it's going to require
[SPEAKER_00]: the modifications and or adjustments to
your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for top shelf, grade a award
winning, best cannabis you could possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow some cannabis that you can
smoke and enjoy with very minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, cost set up time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effort, the time, effort, energy and
equipment that you've got will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be the way that I describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a lot of effort into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six, five, and I weigh about 190
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously don't put a lot of time into
beefing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got cardio for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm strong enough for what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get big and bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not for me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day, but that's never been a
thing on my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be huge, but then you look
at Brock Lesnar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Brock Lesnar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock Lesnar puts a lot of time into being
a big fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If let's just say that we're going for
elite muscular body types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you are looking to win awards,
you got to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to fucking take the steroids,
do the pushups, eat the protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the diet plan going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it all fucking in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look like Brock Lesnar,
uh, if you want the plants that look like
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock Lesnar plants, you need all of the
nutrients, all the equipment, the best
[SPEAKER_00]: whites, the best seeds, the best soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to be in that grow space
twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking on everything, making sure that
everything is fed, making sure that every
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf that needs to be defoliated is
defoliated, making sure that the stems and
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks are popped and twisted and
everything's lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're trellising, it's trellis
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in there twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in there right when the lights come
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once again, right before the
lights go off, you're in there doing work
[SPEAKER_00]: every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to, you could grow some
plants that look like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tall, they're skinny, they're
lanky, but they'll get the job done at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to spend a whole bunch of
time in the gym, a whole bunch of time on
[SPEAKER_00]: a diet plan and you'll accomplish the
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you stand us next to each other,
you'll go that dude right there obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: spent more fucking time in the gym and
that guy was playing video games or
[SPEAKER_00]: recording podcasts or some shit over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not in the gym lift and
weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that and you'll see that in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that being said, I don't want
you to start off being the best grower
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to start off with the equipment
you can afford in the space that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford with the best white and the best
genetics you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then piece it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, figure out how to control the
light cycle in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got a space where you can
control the light cycle, now you can focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on putting a light in there, putting some
seeds in there, putting all of the better
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grow a couple of crops,
read a few books before you grow anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: read a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as you grow, you'll experience
problems and you'll see things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see things you want to improve on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep reading more books, watch more
podcasts, learn things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just like any hobby, most,
most people don't have the advantage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blessing, the advantage to go out and
buy the best equipment for a brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to start karate,
if you're going to buy the drums,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to buy baseball equipment,
if you're going to get into hockey,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to be a new podcaster,
most of us don't have the blessings,
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantage to go and just buy the most
expensive, best shit, which is what we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do for our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to the grow store and you say,
I want the best light, the best tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best fucking dehumidifier,
the best soil, best nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit up Rasta Jeff, get the best genetics,
get the best equipment, get all the best
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we can't all do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the best shit costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the best light, get a good tent,
get a good environment, something in which
[SPEAKER_00]: you can control the light and dark cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be one of the main
elements which we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, get a good light,
then get good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'd recommend good seeds,
but you can get clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your friend grew them, saved you a
step already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're good clones,
but maybe also your friend selected some
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to get some seeds and find
the good shit, but spend the money on a
[SPEAKER_00]: good enclosure, a good tent, build
something somewhere you can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: light, the dark, and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then spend money on a good light,
then good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, everything else will come
into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need fans, dehumidifier,
something to control the climate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, some sort of air exchange,
a blower, stuff like that, a pH pen,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff will come in line,
but buy the best light and nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get to start off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as you get better, you will buy more
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing for production,
if you're making a profit off of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: how about every time you harvest,
you put a good portion of that harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: back into your grow space and into your
skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to pull a pound of okay
weed this time, how about next time we
[SPEAKER_00]: pull a pound and a quarter of even better
weed, and the next time a pound and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: of even better weed, and we work our way
up until we're pulling three pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: light of fucking top shelf, amazing,
impressive weed in every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't your last grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first time when we build this,
this is your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the starting run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a bike with some training wheels,
get a helmet, and just start training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to crash a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you're even into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you can dedicate the time,
the energy, the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like getting a puppy, but at the end
of it, you get to smoke it and take some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to spend some time,
some energy, some love, some money,
[SPEAKER_00]: some adjustments into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some commitments, some
sacrifices, some dedication to be put into
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any other hobby you start,
you don't need to start off with the best
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got into drumming, I've been
playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the drums for a good example
because I've been playing the drums for
[SPEAKER_00]: over, I don't even want to say how many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing the drums for over 20
years, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a drum set for over 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I bought my first drum set,
I thought I knew exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I wanted this here, this here,
these things here, this, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I wanted these pedals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my drum set is nothing like what it
was when I designed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was 15, I understand that my body,
my physical needs, my skill, my setup for
[SPEAKER_00]: my body and my drums and my budget and my
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all changed and evolved in so many
ways that the idea of what I thought I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to play, how I thought I was going
to play, who, where, and when I thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to play with none of that is the
same now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my entire drum set is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also my gross spaces have evolved
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also still continue to evolve
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every season I change stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gotten to the point where I can see
what's happening to the plants really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make changes on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to make some changes and
screw some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I try to add or change or subtract
or different, adjust, modify, change
[SPEAKER_00]: something almost every run, every other
run so that I can see where I can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: or see what products work or see what
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you've been following along,
you learned that last winter I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: that I should not switch to LEDs right at
the beginning of the fucking winter
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from my HBS is to brand new LEDs
that like a week later was negative 17
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way to keep my gross space
cold because the HBS lights that I had in
[SPEAKER_00]: there were doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've learned not to switch that
shit in the middle, but my gross space is
[SPEAKER_00]: always evolving, ever changing,
new ideas, new equipment, just like my
[SPEAKER_00]: drum set, just like your guitar setup,
just like your hockey gear, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our shit evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're getting started,
don't let all the stuff I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a light, a tent, pots,
soil, a dehumidifier, possibly a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier, maybe an air conditioner,
maybe a heater, definitely some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan to remove humidity and heat
from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe a duct to pull fresh air into
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need some sort of pH monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need an EC monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need all kinds of mixing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it'd be cool to have a VPD monitor in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'd like to add CO2 and a CO2
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to build an auto watering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to do this and then all of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to talk about trichomes
and terpenes and testing numbers and days
[SPEAKER_00]: and durations and fucking productivity of
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because I've been doing it for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let all that shit intimidate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature grows weed outside every year all
the time without us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gets involved in that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens beautifully just the way that
whatever you believe in, the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, the way that jaw, the way that
Buddha, the way that the flying spaghetti
[SPEAKER_00]: monster intended it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can definitely happen indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw it up as little as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need all the fancy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start off with a little bit of
shit, build up as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I didn't start off with the
greatest stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little tiny light that kind of
flickered sometimes when it came on,
[SPEAKER_00]: it hummed and made a weird noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was afraid I was going to burn down
the freaking house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little tent that had light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put duct tape all over the light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew two good rounds in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, we smoked all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second run, I sold it and made enough
money out of that second run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, possibly there was medical
marijuana then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe possibly sold that second crop and
bought another tent that was twice the
[SPEAKER_00]: size and bought another light,
bought an air conditioner, bought a blower
[SPEAKER_00]: and had two grow spaces now and turned one
into a veg space, one into a flower space,
[SPEAKER_00]: started production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every time I would harvest another
crop, I would just buy another piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: gear, another piece of gear, a better
piece of gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That piece sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's buy a new one when we harvest and
get another one and just make a wish list.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest, you're going to have
some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right, you're either going to
save the money you've been spending on
[SPEAKER_00]: product, or you're going to flip some of
it and make a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinvest in your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow is now your business,
your hobby, your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some money into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to put some love back into you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some energy, some time, some effort
on it and you will learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will become a great grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a white belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was brand new one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm here teaching the community how to
improve every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that you have to set up the
first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first grow should not be a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't buy your kid a Ferrari for
their first car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get them a Pinto or a Pacer or some
shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that Pinto, get that Pacer bro crash a
few times, then get that F1 racer and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking win the race.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
