[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is
time for episode five hundred and ninety
[SPEAKER_01]: two of the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're watching on YouTube,
I'm sure you can see by now that white
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is going to do a little bit of a
there's a recent political thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is going to clear up some myths and
misconceptions and kind of tell us what is
[SPEAKER_01]: going on with this cannabis news bill that
is happening that everyone's talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we do like to start this
show by talking about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be a polite host and ask
Mike, what are you smoking on tonight,
brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of local flour, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hitting different shops lately
and I think a lot of people heard me
[SPEAKER_00]: bitching about people not driven because
things have been looking a lot better than
[SPEAKER_00]: they were a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some dispensary herb and it is
completely super trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen herb trim like this in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very well trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may have been listening to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last couple runs I've made,
everything looked a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your local shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up some flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you noticed that shops, their menus
are changing rapidly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a lot more cannabis
consumption every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are buying the shops out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cleaning it out really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having to restock really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen traffic at the dispensaries
like this in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like four twenty every day at the
dispensary now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sales reports reflect that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get reported in the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been ridiculous for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of predicted that at the start of
the whole thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said this cannabis is going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when they were doing curbside
service, they were still crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the shop today and drove right
past because their parking lot was
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely full and they had a line out
the door, 15 deep out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't feel like waiting in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they must be having a sale or
something in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a Saturday, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird when one shop right down the
street has all the people and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three shops on the way with no
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, that's the shop that
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should probably just kind of
consolidate all those other shops or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the market will get there eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw we watched that happen in Denver
when the broadster dam, the Broadway
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue boom happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a dispensary every block.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dispensary and a Starbucks every
block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all the Starbucks survived,
but half of those dispensaries disappeared
[SPEAKER_01]: quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they all became a different chain
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all eaten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get ourselves back on
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you were polite enough to ask,
I am smoking garlic banger live batter
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those garlicky turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice mellow buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why maybe I'm a little bit slower
than usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm kind of slow all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It settles me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like nice winter concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a savory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's perfect for this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been able to find it or get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am really excited that the garlic
banger is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just checked my stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've got plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll socially distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pass you the dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw it at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do dabs like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also may smoke some flour here on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some double dose flour that I
picked up at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show it to the camera here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not often that I see things that I
bred on the menu at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said, Hey, did you see the shop
has your stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked it up and I was like,
they really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out who grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve of that grow that cultivation
facility does a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and checked out the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this snug is really dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see the density, but it's also
really dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that Colorado crunch to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tab it on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this mic is not, it's not that kind
of, maybe you can hear it drop on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear it hit the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really dense, but a double dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was there buying that and the,
the lovely young budtender lady,
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in right away and she's like,
do you know what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, I want a quarter of
double dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, Oh, you knew what you wanted
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know about the double dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, I know about the double dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, have you tried it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see what you guys did with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, do you know anything about
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, I know everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invented that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she kind of looked at me and the other
budtender looked at me and I go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got the double dose that I made
and you've got two others on your shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: here that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't know what to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't seem to care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just young budtender girls,
but they were kind of confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold me my quarter and I was happy
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been puffing on it occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of a dab snob, but having these
bowls around when you're talking,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I get you going, I love to have
something with my hands and smoking this
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl is definitely going to help with my
attention span.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will give me more time to let you talk
and not feel like I got to jump in there
[SPEAKER_01]: so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs are great, but they take a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it takes a minute to recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'm on a podcast and I do a big
ripper of a dab and the next two minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: is just life going in my head and you're
talking and I've got an audience and a
[SPEAKER_01]: camera and these lights, bro, they make
dabs four times more intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious that these lights just,
you're just like, oh, it's okay guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take out these lights off me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get used to it, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, that's a lot of light for a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've spent some time in front of
these lights, trying to get used to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first turned them on, I was like,
I bought the wrong too powerful light rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more comfortable than I was when they
showed up a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a minute to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of comfortable in these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I love changing the color behind me
and playing with these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting the temperature of the light
color dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using the MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not using the a 4k camera today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just on the MacBook since we're
zooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lovely 4k.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did notice that I recorded a really nice
4k video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted it up to YouTube and then YouTube
took it and squished it down and made it a
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty compression file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that was frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I did wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loaded it up as 4k.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty sure, but we did not get 4k
out of that bad bitch, but that's how it
[SPEAKER_01]: went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just happy that we're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm reaching for some notes
because I'm trying to do Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've got the notes on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you want to segue into doing Patreon

[SPEAKER_01]: kind folks who support the show on

those folks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Patreon, if you'd like to support the
show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: visit patreon.com forward slash grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the information will be right there
on the screen in the video description in
[SPEAKER_01]: the show notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will also include Mike's Patreon
link there so you can support white Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the part of the show where I
am polite enough to pass it over to Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: and let him do his Patreon shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it away, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to give a shout out to a
couple of people supporting me on Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Chris Sterling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate their support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa Z, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Purple Thumb, Farmer Z, Mobius Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights wouldn't be here without y
'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, really, really hits nice this
time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you guys' support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we should give them an extra shout
out because a lot of people, they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: weird situations in these times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of buying a gift or a bag of
herb or a bag of seeds or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bag of fucking noodles, they decided to
send some funds your way and my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is noticed and it is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do notice all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike notices it, especially during the
holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does help out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike, you said a name that I don't
know that I recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be getting a supporter that
doesn't contribute to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their name may pop up, but I haven't seen
one of those names yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You going to be OK over there,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that vape pen, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me right in the throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you took a dab before the show that
you coughed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was rude, so I didn't record
it because now I thought I may have to
[SPEAKER_01]: call your wife and be like, hey,
Mike's passed out downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go check on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you looked at the camera toward
the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of looked at where the camera
might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, that took me places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, dude, you're not even
fucking in there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little bit jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's why you're coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't blame that damn dab pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two dabs I took when we fired up
the Zoom were the first two dabs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, they did take me places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said earlier it's a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't take long for me to be firing
up the dab nail today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely a well-deserved weekend
to kind of take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still got plenty of shit done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, boy, I was ripped doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did two kids on COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no weekends no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clear up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said two kids on COVID, not with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the internet is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't say with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said on during.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got two kids during COVID times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only two time periods in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's when they're awake and when
they're asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not night.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to say before
COVID and during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, what about before kids and
after kids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't those time periods?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're awake and when they're
asleep, bro, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really all there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the text messages you send me,
I laugh inside a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, that poor guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have kids, it can't be
explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a 17 year old daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our adventures are way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got two young little boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a big girl, different adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, you just spend a lot of time
staring at a wall going, hmm, what do I do
[SPEAKER_01]: or say about this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, one of them grabs a handful of mac
and cheese and just pelted his brother
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I bet that about 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I pulled something similar with
my brother, but just watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come around the corner and I see him
wind up and pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see the lead up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other brother was pretty calm when he
got hit in the side of the face with mac
[SPEAKER_00]: and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas, your mac and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake your head and get the wipes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start getting the cheese out of the
carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you clean up the kid or the carpet
first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one goes first, the kid or the
carpet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the kid's just going to continue to
get fucking dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wash the kid in the tub for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wash the carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 300 bucks to rent the thing and
the soap and the day and the moving the
[SPEAKER_00]: furniture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kid can wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a visual carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a visual in my head of you
holding each kid up and the wife out there
[SPEAKER_01]: with just the sprayer, just hosing the
hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dad lawn sprayer gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joint hanging out of your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike doesn't smoke around the kids,
but in my visual, that's how it's fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: My visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a good thing that like it when
we were in, well, this show is far ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've needed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a couple of pretty intense
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a tester episode telling everybody
what I expect about testers in another
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, talking about lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to cut loose and have Mike on
for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The background is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to get all intense with a
purple background?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to enjoy the purple vibes,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving the purple vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue, the other night looked crispy as
fuck too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Patreon folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got sidetracked when I was saying
without all the Patreon folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wouldn't look this good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My setup wouldn't look near this good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have the Joe Rogan Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have these damn lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a love hate relationship with these
lights right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wall definitely wouldn't change
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the wall does change colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys keep watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got more stuff up my sleeve too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not time to reveal it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning all these toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming together really beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks just stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love some of the new
developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did buy what is slowing me down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I did buy another computer and Apple
is taking four to six weeks to build that
[SPEAKER_01]: computer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it's here, the show, you'll see
more improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be more options for more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Computer can only handle so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now I'm limited a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought new cameras and things and new
recording equipment and the computer was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to upgrade to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a new computer coming,
but Apple is, that's Apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're building it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered, I clicked exactly what I wanted
in this machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's coming for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, yeah, they got to put in the
pieces and screw in all the parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, shout out to Reefer Madness for
the help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also gave me some tech advice buying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the perfect machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about it when it gets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited, but Patreon helped for that a
lot heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have, that's how I feel about
the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I got them set up, I knew I had
exactly what the right thing I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, yeah, I watched so many
YouTube videos and when I typed in,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this the machine I want for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, this is the number one
rated machine that blew video editing out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the way and are out of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that's, we're buying this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next piece in my world is going to be a
new mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a new mic stand first than a new
mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have the one that's on the table
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just come pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Joe Rogan mic is pimped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on here twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on like once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that adds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to be on here twice a week,
but I'm not holding it against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just talked about the savages that you
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wants to be, but peeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you, which brings us full circle
back to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way easier to find a fine time to
record when you're like, man, I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: paid to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, you make tighter notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd make a tighter schedule and you're
like, Oh, Patreon is how much this month I
[SPEAKER_01]: am definitely going to deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going on five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've never missed a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's closer to six or seven to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could look in the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the exact date in the phone
somewhere, but I don't want to scroll
[SPEAKER_01]: through while we're on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the show notes on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we do have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a method to the madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gathered here today for a real
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, it's not a wedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a funeral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there has been some news that I don't
completely understand and social media
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely doesn't completely understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that if I don't understand
it and social media doesn't understand it,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a large portion of my audience
that doesn't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to admit that I am, uh,
politically ignorant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get into politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care about politics until fucking
obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily I met Mike and I got involved in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had political issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: The owner of that dispensary had legal and
political issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike kind of showed me how to handle
political issues and develop my own
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions and thoughts around these
political things with the little
[SPEAKER_01]: information that I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I didn't care about politics and
like legalization of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think it mattered, but now that,
uh, I'm involved in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: now that I'm a, I'm kind of, I've got a
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got multiple companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a tax paying fucking citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it took me, now I'm a tax paying
fucking citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I understand why people care so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The decisions that those people make
heavily affect my today, my tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, probably the
decisions made today by our leaders are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to affect me mostly in five to 10,
15 years is what I'm starting to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I'm not going to be old
enough to fucking bounce back and recover
[SPEAKER_01]: and just say, sorry, I'll just work harder
and make more money next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, I'm fucking old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm retired and now I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it's going to be if I don't
stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've started paying more attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I don't understand completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on with this bill?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how it all works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Mike does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of my people out
there listening that are already saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even need to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand this better than Mike,
but still hang out with us, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause you may learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want your feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how we did on this,
but Mike, I'm going to quit rambling and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's talk about, um, the thing called the
more act.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a house bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just recently was voted on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I guess my first question is what
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, house of representatives is one
half of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the house and the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the house of representatives has a
whole truckload of people in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Senate only two senators per
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's total of a hundred senators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way more people in the house of
representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house of representatives just voted on
what they're calling the more act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acronym for the marijuana
opportunity reinvestment and expungement
[SPEAKER_00]: act of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or the short, uh, the more act of
2019, um, it, uh, removes or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: passed into law, eventually it would
remove, um, marijuana from the controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substances act, um, completely descheduled
cannabis federally leaving, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do about cannabis legality
strictly up to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sort of how alcohol is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you talk and say, we want state
license stores only in three, two beer in
[SPEAKER_00]: places like California, you can get vodka
at seven 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just totally leaves it up to the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the more act also does a couple other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, um, set a 5% federal tax on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that money would go into a trust
fund for various areas that were harmed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other portions of that money would go to
the small business administration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would have loans and services
available for, um, startup cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, just like they do for all
other businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it would prohibit the denial of
federal public benefits to a person on the
[SPEAKER_00]: basis of certain cannabis related,
uh, conduct or convictions and prohibit
[SPEAKER_00]: the denial of benefits and protections
under immigration laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, if you're Canadian and
you've been arrested for having pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a ticket for it back before it was
legal in Canada, and you try to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: the U S and they say, have you ever been
charged with a cannabis crime?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, yes, you don't get to come to
the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a super obnoxious rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the more act gets passed into law,
that's history too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of good stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some less good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like anything Congress does,
they got to fuck it up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for the most part, this is a
pretty good bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a huge step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, neither part of Congress, the house or
the Senate has ever voted on something
[SPEAKER_00]: this sweeping as far as cannabis goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it is quite historic, even if it
doesn't go anywhere, which is very likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the negative side of this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the positive side is it's a pretty good
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's historic in what it does and how far
it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But government, um, so the house of
representatives has voted and passed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Senate has to, um, the Senate is
currently controlled by Mitch McConnell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, I meant that, uh,
I'm not going to edit it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get hate mail on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send a hate mail to add Nemo punk 15,
um, Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, here's where we stand now with the
more act and federal descheduling of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house has passed it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate can choose to take it up or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for the bill to move forward at all,
the Senate would have to choose to vote on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and pass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now, like I mentioned earlier,
there's a hundred senators total right now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're divided along a 52 to 48 split.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 52 Republicans, 48 Democrats,
which brings us to Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Georgia, uh, Senate race is currently
in a runoff election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it looks like it's going to be the
most expensive Senate race in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, both sides are pouring money into
Georgia right now, attempting to lock down
[SPEAKER_00]: those two Senate seats because those
Senate seats will either lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuation of the 52 48 split in favor
of the Republicans or lead to an even 50
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 split Republican and Democrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If both of the Georgia Senate seats go to
Democrats is the only way the more act
[SPEAKER_00]: goes through the Senate is the
conventional wisdom right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I'm not positive what the two
Republicans running for those seats have
[SPEAKER_00]: said about cannabis, but in general,
the Republican party has not at all been
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when the more act passed in the house,
I think only five or 10 Republicans voted
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, it's not popular among
Republican elected representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just ha is just how it is in the U S
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, if this goes forward,
we need the Senate in the two Georgia
[SPEAKER_00]: seats and Senate to both go Democrat and
then the Senate to choose to uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: read the more act and vote on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it passes in the Senate,
it's likely to be a 50 50 tie,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would mean the vice president
settles the tiebreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and the way everything looks to
be playing out right now, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the sponsor of this act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, vice president elect Harris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really, really long shot that
this bill goes anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's only likely passed to getting
signed by the president is if Georgia goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to blue Senate seats, which is super
unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we happen to get a 50 50 tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vice president elect chooses
to vote with the Democrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a long, long road, but where we
are right now is still definitely worth
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrating because it's never happened
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people never thought it would
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did all that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: That all made mostly made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was a lot of information
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you covered all of my, I had three
questions is what the hell happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I think you worked too close
to my third question is what happens if
[SPEAKER_01]: this works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we do want federal legalization,
but what if this does go through Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does, how does, how do things change
for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do things change for our dispensary
worker friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the change will be slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so right now Colorado, already has a
ton of rules in place for our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and none of them would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now, I guess the anti-pop
movements, best hope is that the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government will remember that cannabis is
illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technically every marijuana business
in the country is violating federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at any point, the department of
justice or the DEA or any other of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucratic agencies could decide to just
decimate our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the more act passes, that threat
goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all of a sudden to ADE, the really
horrible tax bill that says, because
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a schedule one narcotic,
we can't deduct payroll, normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, business expenses from federal taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis gets decimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer a schedule one narcotic to
ADE doesn't apply anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so this bill has, um, the potential to
have major implications across the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we can make those deductions,
I mean, that's health insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the health insurance money
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the payroll money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to federal taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use a regular bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true anymore.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, business loans, just like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you recently ran into a thing,
uh, where you had trouble with banking
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all those headaches go away for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they have to do is type in,
they can go to the, uh, Colorado marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement division website and type in
your name and it will tell you if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a marijuana enforcement division badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're going to the bank to apply
for a loan or for a bank account,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to give them your social security
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could type that in and that will pop
up right on the MED website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tells you right away that person
is, and mine says right there was clear on
[SPEAKER_01]: the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: She showed it to me that you have this
badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that messed with my banking had to do
some hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, uh, our cannabis laws in this
country have sort of infected everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, prohibition was such a bad concept and
the people in power so desperately wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: it to work that they kept trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kept trying and kept trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it's literally affected
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected public assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected scholarships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected policing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected retirement programs and how
police operate and the public's
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this bill is a major, major step
towards undoing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, if this bill gets passed,
it's not like all that's over tomorrow or
[SPEAKER_00]: the day after it's passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just a good first or a good next
step, not a good first step, a good next
[SPEAKER_00]: step, but we, we still got a long way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the more act to get through the
Senate, basically everybody that hears
[SPEAKER_00]: this needs to call their elected
representative, hop on Google,
[SPEAKER_00]: hop on your phone real quick, type in who
is my Senator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll give you a name and contact info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact them however you're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email, phone, fax, TikTok, whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, Hey, I care about the more act than
I vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please vote to pass the more act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please vote yes on holding hearings on the
more act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you're elected representatives
hear that the more likely they are to vote
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guarantee you the other side is
making those calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already seen quite a few social media
posts, um, trying to get votes on the more
[SPEAKER_00]: act stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, project Sam, the nation's big
anti-cannabis group, uh, is claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: victory for getting the vote delayed till
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to vote on it before the
November elections and it got delayed till
[SPEAKER_00]: after purposefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it, uh, this is the only,
this is the only victories they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, they lost pretty big on
election night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five more States joined us legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're prolonging their now that's all
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're prolonging your defeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generation dreadlocks has taken over,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drive me nuts because I mean,
we really have moved past, are we going to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we not that cat's out the bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't going back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a lot of things, but if you
tell me I can't have them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how life works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I feel like that's what
prohibition does to things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a red button right there,
I don't care about the red button.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put, do not press this red button
on the button.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk away, I'm going to press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's prohibition works the same way,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't prohibited and treated like
something we can't have, it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, just legalize it federally
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us do what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, I don't think there's any set
of circumstances that lead to a major
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal, reversal nationally on cannabis
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's too widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too embraced and it's too ingrained
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the anti-groups doesn't figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of joining the conversation
and helping us make smart workable
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, they're still being obstinate
in fighting tooth and nail every step of
[SPEAKER_00]: progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely making those calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make 15, 20 calls a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send out a shit ton of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I say it all the time, the cannabis
community's the largest voting block in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U S we would all just focus for a
minute and unify in any way we could
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate politics for the next 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now is a really easy opportunity
to shoot an email at your Senator and
[SPEAKER_00]: flood those inboxes and phone banks with,
Hey, I support the Moore act.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to remember how you voted on
this the next time you're up for
[SPEAKER_00]: reelection.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not like you if you don't do this
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We employ them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We vote for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm, I'm already writing an email to
Hickenlooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's got some famous, not great
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some great cannabis quotes and
now he's our elected Senator in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he better be interested in voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the more actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to eat my shit every day till
he's at office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're here, Colorado, you got to be on
team green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the pioneers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to send your emails to your
elected officials and let them know vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the more act to do encourage the vote
on the more act.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need all the people, all the support we
can get Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any more notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more stuff that we need to
cover on this or is it time to ramble for
[SPEAKER_01]: a minute?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just one last plea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to be in Georgia,
make sure you vote in these runoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please make sure you vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your friends vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your auntie votes, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cletus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.
I'm looking at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go vote, Cletus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get everybody in the truck and go vote,
Cletus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them all in the truck.
Go vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that was a really good
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave them a lot of good rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave them some good political talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only said one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only said one thing that's going to
piss a few people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to go over well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how it's I would, I really
understand when people ask and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to keep the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody should ever go to
jail for consuming a plant that grew out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should be able, I'm not going
to go too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as what you're doing doesn't hurt
me or the earth or cause any crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: ripples, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to smoke whatever,
if you want to smoke battery acid and
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking bleach, have a good time,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't do it in my backyard where I
got to deal with you and we're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think we should all be able to
do what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of, if they make rules
that let us not able to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got to speak up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of, I've got a platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a smart friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be doing a disservice if I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be doing a disservice if I didn't
come on here and say, we got a job to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of my job, not just to teach
you how to grow, but then more people can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there'll be more cannabis around more
legal cannabis, better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of my goal is to get better
cannabis out there for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's legal, you don't have to fucking
drive from your house to your buddy's
[SPEAKER_01]: house to get in their car and then drive
to the growth store and their car,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go drive around the block a few
times and drive the long way home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what's following you drive that
car into the garage, unload all this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: into your car in the garage, then drive
your car home and take the long way home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you don't have to play all
those dumb games anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the growth store, you buy what
you need, but then go home and set up your
[SPEAKER_01]: tent and you grow like a pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's better when it's legal,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's better except the taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a, okay, the taxes, but that's
expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a downside?
[SPEAKER_01]: If this does pass, I've got my own
suspicions and fears that I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: open up those cans of worms on this
episode, but is there a possible downside?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to read which amendments were
passed with it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worrying about a downside is silly because
the downside to how the law exists
[SPEAKER_00]: currently is far greater than the downside
that would exist if the law changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was an amendment offered to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if it passed or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it did, but not a hundred percent
that it's sort of like Colorado's barring
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have been convicted of drug
and cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts out some of the best talent
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of the conversation when
Colorado and Washington first went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We specifically banned anyone that had
gotten in trouble before because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling an idea that scared the shit out
of white America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a lot less scared now in a lot
of states that have, the conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved drastically in the states that
have legalized since Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington to where the legal industries
should be inclusive of everybody that was
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the industry before it was
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Colorado, still the five and 10
year ban exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was an amendment offered to the
more act that continued that federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what the specifics of it
though, where I'd have to triple check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's likely to be some not great
undercurrents to this if it goes all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through to passage, but that's a
really long journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of time between now and
then for edits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a piece of it that you
really hate or you can't live with,
[SPEAKER_00]: include that in your letter to your
Senator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I really like this, but get rid of
paragraph two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real, real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's editable still at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of learning to do still,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're around to teach me about
politics and the processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in school, they did not teach
me any of this stuff in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some schools try, some schools don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know which school you went to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just, Pueblo is too small
for us to shit on one of the schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern California schooling is when I
should have learned about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in school and those grades is when I
should have learned this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't get, yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think seventh and eighth are usually
when people learn civics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, there's a huge, when you look
at who votes and the vote totals,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in this last election where turnout
was as high as it's ever been,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you add up Trump's score and Biden's
score and all of the other people that ran
[SPEAKER_00]: for president score, and then you compare
that to the total number of Americans,
[SPEAKER_00]: the total number of voters is way fucking
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of compromise fucks with a lot of
people's cognitive dissonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's, it's understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't follow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to follow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my nightmare gives me like a,
it's not a headache, but it's just like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I just, I'm done hearing about it
and it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's cool, but nobody likes him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a fucking giant soap opera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it used to be, it felt more political.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it feels kind of soap opera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like WWF or WWE or whatever they call
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't joking a couple episodes ago when
I said my superpower is sort of being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sit for these meetings and not lose my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember sitting at city council and I
was looking at stuff in front of me and it
[SPEAKER_00]: said very clearly like on line one that we
were going to have zero marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down on line 20, it said we could
expect half a million dollars from our
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one else in the hearing,
no one else in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 50 adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else picks up on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they asked for public comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, can I get some comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I the only one in the room that's high
enough to do math still?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what the fuck is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the two nights later is when one
of the city and city council people told
[SPEAKER_00]: me, Hey, I'm going to step down next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try to take my seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to sit through this and
follow the thread, like you can conquer
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not, I'm glad you're there
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my, uh, I was at a meeting a couple
of days ago and my brain hit that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, is this done yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I am like, just, you know,
it's probably as a former cigarette
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker, there's probably about that 40
minute mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it happened to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain went, yeah, you've been here long
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think every 55 minutes is how I
built that nicotine program in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the person on the other side of
the table, I think they caught on cause
[SPEAKER_01]: they go, well, so you've been here for
long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go ahead and wrap up and get you out
of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, did you just notice
that my ADD just went, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then city council meetings, dude,
by the time I walk in, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this building's intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about anybody here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that always made me
laugh is at the start of the meeting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the room is packed standing room only
there's 18, 20 people standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's six or 10 people in the
hallway and usually 20 minutes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people left in the room are
required by law to be there being paid to
[SPEAKER_00]: be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for one reason or another have some
issue later in the meeting that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: desperate to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not 15 people left in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not standing room only
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you can like lay down and you
know, kickbox and shit in the aisles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no echo happens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's just there for the first 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wait for the invocation and then
they're there to see the two people get
[SPEAKER_00]: their award for the week or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody bails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're left there alone with city
government to say or do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became natural to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we've been going for,
Oh, go ahead, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you wrap that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage people seriously start right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this stuff is happening online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like things are going to get
a little more restrictive right now as we
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the deeper parts of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things are happening
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're part of the world,
we're resistant to that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the time to figure out when your
city, your town or whatever meets on Zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: and check those meetings out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out where you can add your two
cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's an issue that you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not even cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if more people were involved,
shit would be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they don't all have the same idea as
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're living a different lifestyle than
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they don't think about us when
they make their decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't generalize like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilmanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be council personist.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I like to try to
remind myself is everybody on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: has just as rich and interesting life as
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just don't know about it yet,
but everybody's got their own shit going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and use that to your advantage,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relate to people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They relate to you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't think you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you went to city council,
you made an impression, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't feel like you belong there or feel
comfortable there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had 10 or 15 people behind me,
I had those city council people shitting
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want somebody with the ability
to bring friends to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scares the hell out of elected
officials.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely knew that our little
cheering section there was there to
[SPEAKER_01]: support medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely understood that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was completely, I was professional
and respectful and all I had to do was
[SPEAKER_01]: show up and smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we did make a presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this started, I never thought we'd be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like we might seriously see
federal legalization in our lifetime,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you and me can grow some herb and
put it in a box and legally send it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: store shelf in New York where California
or Oregon or France.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're headed there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really, really headed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friends in California that grow and
my friends in New York that grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can all just trade products,
just send a couple ounces around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a couple of spots around the
country that are known for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production, just like there are for wine
production or fashion industry or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't have people growing in their
basement everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope some people still want to,
I hope they still want to never stop you
[SPEAKER_01]: basement bandits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep fucking doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time there's gotta be, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those basement Buccaneers are the ones
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got 16 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those gets special love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 1600 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get noticed sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, hopefully the emitter works in
every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I'm gonna cut you off now
because we're working our way past the 45
[SPEAKER_01]: minute mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make this too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's ADD will kick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they got enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for listening,
everybody.

[SPEAKER_01]: That freaked me out.

[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take too big of a hit on a
podcast like I just did or do it looked
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might leave that right in the video.

screen out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it to see that whole event
