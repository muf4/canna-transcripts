[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710, a big disaster in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bombs are going off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We whip the batter till it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my butter on another matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the tip of the dabbing tends to chip
the shatter in my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikes I'm set to scorch, but get the dome
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm a vector torch and the
microphone's a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the truth, all you liars go to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I grab the mic, it's like a
giant show and tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been doing this since way
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get A's until I blazed them,
my great slack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to college and acknowledged that I
hated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the way you act, cut the jealous
crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's fishy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I smell a rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our house, but we ain't got to
tell them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's leave them at the front door,
yelling at the welcome mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, everybody, get another dab pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same routine, slightly different from the
last track.
[SPEAKER_00]: A million songs about we, but where the
dabs at?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like my dabbing songs,
you can kiss my ass crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, everybody, drop another huge
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 game, 710, it's time to move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to episode number 25 of the I Grow
[SPEAKER_03]: Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for joining me for the 25th
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Task Rock for letting me
play his tracks in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Task and Linus at 710
The Movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight we have Kevin and Adam over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin looks like he's having a seizure
while he's trying to dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some funny shit to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked up from the recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm white.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you're doing the Humpty
dance, might have been what that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like MC Hammer on crack,
Humpty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to catch my breath from some dabs we
took, but we're going to have a great 25th
[SPEAKER_03]: episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pumped, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here for 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just showed up, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for getting here right on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Running a little late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are pretty crazy at the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gave Kevin and I some time to take some
dabs and hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the hut, did you call it the hut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure how it's the hut, but the actual
hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabba owns it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabba owns that hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I should mention that we've got the
email set up next to us on the Eric Ross
[SPEAKER_03]: 4.0 rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say hello to the email, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the email talking back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be doing a lot of work tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to the music?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's responsible for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I think you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming again.
Watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quiet in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we'll just do it that one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So man, thanks for coming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's episode 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted you guys here because Spence and
Jesse are hard to get here, or they would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been here, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, at this time of night,
they're not coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're the second choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want all four here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the invite regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love coming over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that I'm all high and you guys want
to turn that and make me sound like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wanted all four of you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted all four of you guys here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been loud, but it would
have been fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it would have been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have had to get more chairs out,
more microphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But imagine that party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably one other dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like one in the morning,
you guys that are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one in the morning on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we all had shit to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev's got a life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you had to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys weren't on my second choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got me feeling bad and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just giving you shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make me cry on the 25th episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so last night, Adam and myself and
another friend went to a comedy show at
[SPEAKER_03]: ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a comedian called Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Called Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sound like an Asian guy when you say it
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy called Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: He named Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was pretty funny, but I thought he was
kind of clean for my taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of good old boy comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said nasty on the ride there,
so I was really expecting dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ComedyWorks is hooking me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone to a lot of ComedyWorks shows,
and they see my email address on a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they called me, and they're like,
we'll give you free tickets to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: shows, or you can get $5 tickets to a
bunch of other shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do it just to fill the seats is
what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see why now that we got there,
why that comedy show was $5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told them next time, give me somebody
dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I want something dirtier,
a little filthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The opening act, there was a host who I
always forget his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ron Something, and I feel bad that I
forget his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a comedian, well known for doing
dabs, dab jokes, weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good host.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's getting better at being a host.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he like in a comedy group?
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to be, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a short dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to call you short, bro, but I'm
6'5".
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's fucking short to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll Google him when we take a dab break.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was his name again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ron was his first name, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a real friendly looking, but he's a
comedian, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything I say to describe him,
he's a real friendly looking dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know if he was one of the
guys I saw at Phil's one night,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there were two comedians that came
down from Denver that were fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hilarious and did some awesome dab jokes
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could have been this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually tipped him with some goodies
because of the jokes that they made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some goodies, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only two comedians that did that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Following up, that guy was the host.
[SPEAKER_03]: Following him was a guy named Deacon Grey,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a comedian before Deacon Grey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deacon, oh no, because it was the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like the host kind of did a
short set.
[SPEAKER_04]: The host did a five minute set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Deacon Grey came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys don't know Deacon Grey,
Deacon Grey is a Denver local as far as I
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of an older dude, and he's had
time to calm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a hyper kid, and he's got his
delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is flawless.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't look like he's up there
performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's up there having as much fun as we
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did quite a bit of high humor too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems easy to write jokes about pot,
but it's ... Right, and it has to be ...
[SPEAKER_03]: In Denver now, there's a thing where
everybody's a pot comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be a pot comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have that ... You can throw in
your pot set for when the crowd gets
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't rely on that because it gets old
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't about pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more about the high humor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, about being high kind of than it
was about like, I get my weed for cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deacon Grey, I recommend that dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can see him, go see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might have a website or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do any research on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a big shout out to Melissa from
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: She probably does not have any clue about
this podcast, but she made it listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: She should listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell her next time I talk to her on
the phone, I'll be like, you should listen
[SPEAKER_03]: to my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: She hooked it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She made it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be catching Joe Rogan at ComedyWorks
next week, and I'll let you guys know how
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes on with the next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coughing it up over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been taking dabs, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse my little miniature pauses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not me dying at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also kind of cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left the air on until fucking like
midnight, and it got like 64 degrees in
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was 60 degrees less anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was chilly in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been used to it being like 85,
90, and then I walked up here and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: 60, 64, not a shivering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, random talk on the show,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we get too far, this is a
celebration show, but we have something
[SPEAKER_03]: really awesome to add to this celebration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to announce that Mark Emery is
home in Canada with his wife, Jodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys follow the show, you know that
Mark Emery was arrested and held in an
[SPEAKER_03]: American federal prison for distributing
cannabis seeds across the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most listeners of the show would agree
that Mark was in prison for complete
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's great to know that he's
back home with his family where he
[SPEAKER_03]: belongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cuddled up with his wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a picture of him smoking a joint
with some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a picture of him hugging up on his
wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a man should be doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't be locked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's right back on the fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've watched any video
of, he's right up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never really noticed that he spoke
with a wisp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he has a retainer or something,
but it really was pronounced when he like,
[SPEAKER_05]: when he very first stepped back into
Canada and got in front of the microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can, I can link you to the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always remember him going on and on for
days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that's something that I never
really noticed, but he's right back on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And his wife's running for liberal,
liberal, some kind of liberal office up
[SPEAKER_05]: there for their stuff to fight the power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see him back on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big love and much respect to Mark and
Jody Emery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a little bit of checking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark was taken into federal prison on
September 10th, 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was released July 9th, 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used Siri.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I used a calculator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just asked Siri, how many days was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 1,398 days in federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus the time he was locked up while
awaiting trial, the time during the trial
[SPEAKER_03]: and a couple of weeks in limbo after he
was released from federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,398 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam, you look speechless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you familiar with that sort of time
period?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a long, long time, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a long time, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to sound retarded here,
but I did three and then 54 and I felt
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three days and 54 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a little tiny dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's some fucking courage and some
badassness in that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good job, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of what I was going to
ask is now that he was the Prince of Pop
[SPEAKER_05]: before he came in, now does he knock Aryan
off his King throne?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: You ain't done a lick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not touching that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's close to four years though in
federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 46 months, 200 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine your life being disrupted for
200 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd be a totally different person.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he spent his time well.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he learned the bass guitar and he
did a lot of reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So learning the bass in prison,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine was in county jail, not federal
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a whole nother level even.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing and I'm glad he's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he was locked up on, in our opinion,
bullshit charges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullshit charges.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes every seed breeder, pot grower,
it makes us all a little bit kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: worried about ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the rules have changed and now that
they've changed, I can just imagine the
[SPEAKER_05]: culture shock.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was Mark Emmer where he could probably
puff on the street anytime he wanted to,
[SPEAKER_03]: but now... In Canada, they don't really
seem to care from what people have told
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, come here and smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have bigger problems to fry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they don't talk about it like we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get all hyped about it,
but they also don't give a shit about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big shout out to Mark Emmery.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are longtime listeners,
you know that we actually did,
[SPEAKER_03]: we used to do a portion of the show called
Give Thanks, which I will do again in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future, but we've been packing the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been like an hour and 15 minutes
sometimes, and I don't feel like we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to stretch it out with another Give Thanks
portion once we're that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, welcome home, Mark Emmery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much love to Jodie Emmery for being strong
and keeping herself active in the movement
[SPEAKER_03]: while we were down.
[SPEAKER_03]: One soldier.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd the music go?
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Task?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need to take one second to make an
important... I'm fucking high and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuttering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try that in English.
[SPEAKER_03]: In English this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to make an important announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the contests we have started on the
show will be ending soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left a few contests open-ended and I've
been waiting for answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a few questions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those episodes have gotten old and
the giveaways have just faded away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to reuse the prizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll end all of the contests that are
happening now on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: August 17th at 11.59 PM Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jenny Kush prizes and any other unused
prizes will be used for future contests
[SPEAKER_03]: and giveaways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make an official ending
date on those contests so that when I do
[SPEAKER_03]: reuse those prizes, nobody can get mad if
they try to go win the old contests.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Official shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do have a Jenny Kush pin and a couple
other pins and things that I tried to use
[SPEAKER_03]: in contests before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a Jenny Kush pin available
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to check the little box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some prizes set aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put them back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pins are cool giveaways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giveaways?
[SPEAKER_03]: Giveaways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're as high as me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get you a couple dabs if you're
saying you're not as high.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on a podcast where we need... I
don't need to speak well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: For all you ladies and gentlemen that were
hoping to see me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's told you where to find me and look at
my ugly mug before, so let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and dab that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some turpex right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the turpex boys, Jordan and
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also big shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep running, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see you do six miles every
morning without fucking getting winded.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Hunt has quit eating meat,
eats fish still, and he's addicted to
[SPEAKER_03]: soda, and he's cut out the 23,
bro, the Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cut it out of his life, so give him
some strength for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for exercising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I cut out Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be strongly addicted to Mountain
Dew, and I cut that out of my diet,
[SPEAKER_03]: and my body feels better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want another one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm good for a second,
but that was tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, I'm going to take this one right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a dab here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're handing them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're handing out dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how we do it here on the I Grow
Culture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you guys are crazy that
smoke cigarettes and still are able to
[SPEAKER_03]: take dabs and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got a nice outdoor harvest
coming up, so you should just roll a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of... You should get some tobacco,
like some fucking pouched tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't mix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then just roll some joints,
and then you'll get your nicotine fit that
[SPEAKER_03]: way, and then just slowly take the
nicotine out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can ... Like I said, I've done the jail
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just quit.
[SPEAKER_05]: My problem is her smoking next to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We both have to quit, and she's not that
strong-willed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If she doesn't want to quit, then she
won't quit.
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't want to, so I'm trying to ...
I've told her, get a pin and just smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a little pin, pulls it out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the ... You want to say what kind
of brand it is, or I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to shout it out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, they gave him that product to
test out, and he doesn't really have a
[SPEAKER_03]: platform to give a review.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tied up in the headphone cable,
so you're going to be stuck for life now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and tell him the name of the
thing, and then I hit it once.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Neos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam will hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll shut up so you can talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company is Neos.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it's an easier draw,
and better tasting, and more effective
[SPEAKER_02]: than some of the other companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave us some samples to try out to
see if we wanted to carry their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a fairly new company, so they're
just trying to get their name out there
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that's going down right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The battery's a little bit bigger than
some of the other companies that are a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar style, so they have
strain-specific cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you mentioned that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not pro-level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not dab kid dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for a vape pen like
this, it's really attractive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just replace the cartridge on the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for the unscrew-y part,
but you have your finger right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a USB that attaches to the other
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very end of it is a stylus,
so you can use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were a rec patient, what would that
cost me?
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't started carrying them yet,
so I'm not sure, but similar companies
[SPEAKER_02]: with smaller batteries, like I said,
that aren't as great.
[SPEAKER_02]: A starter package is about $58 and some
change for a small cartridge, just a
[SPEAKER_02]: 150-milligram cartridge and a battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to replace the battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can recharge it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to come get cartridges,
and they make them in three different
[SPEAKER_02]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These new ones that we're testing out are
probably going to start carrying those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what the price will be on
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be similar, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool little piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed a different high from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been dabbing for a while,
and I just took another rip off that,
[SPEAKER_03]: and my high changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got me a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lemon diesel, this particular
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab of some Turbex,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have friends that are Turbex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something may have hooked me up with some
hash there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone might have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turbex is badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Jordan, Jordan, Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more of the guys, but those are
the guys I kick with mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take this dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody talk for me for a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's definitely a very attractive case
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not get something like that and fill
it full of wax that she'll hit maybe ...
[SPEAKER_05]: She probably won't clear the damn thing in
a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would last your wife a week?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would last a while, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cartridges would last a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say if it will or not,
but it's very ... It's smooth pull.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to push a button.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, you wear it with a black
shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't ... All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was enough of a free shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a message on Facebook from a
listener named Fred, and ironically,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was asking me to talk about acquiring
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really great because this email came
today while I was preparing for the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, excuse my cough, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from Dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from Big Dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about acquiring seeds,
but before I do that, let me give a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of a legal disclaimer because we don't
want to be the next Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be illegal to acquire cannabis
seeds in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is your responsibility to ... Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to try to edit any of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is your responsibility to know the laws
in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any company online that will send you
seeds is only sending them to you for
[SPEAKER_03]: souvenir purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germinating cannabis seeds is illegal in
most places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not here to help you break the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you decide to buy and or germinate
cannabis seeds, I cannot be responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Colorado, where cannabis is
legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of my advice is for Colorado,
California, Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_03]: or Michigan residents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful and don't get your ass into
trouble because I'm not a lawyer and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not responsible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm simply the host of a badass podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool fucking disclaimer,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to do that because I don't ...
Guys, if you're ordering seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: you must be 18 or 21, and you got to be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know the rules where you are in your
location.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they might have used ... That's
not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know the rules in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use poor grammar, but still do that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, with all that being said,
here's what I can tell you about acquiring
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acquiring some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like quality seeds from reputable
breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to rant on breeders for a
minute?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's some of your favorites?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say whoever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only heard of a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: TGAs definitely got the respect and- TGAs
are rare-dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rare-dankness is definitely great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect both of those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, iogenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be mentioned in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me, of course, so you don't have to
pause or not.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're already here getting dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly Connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you thinking?
MTG seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honestly a fan of a lot of the new
seed breeders coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to take anything away from some of the
old guys who've really paved the way and
[SPEAKER_02]: helped a lot of the new seed breeders get
good genetics to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't take anything away from those
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the iogenetics, Laplata Labs,
Gage Green Genetics, they're all doing
[SPEAKER_02]: some really awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're thinking about what they're
crossing and what they're trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: out of their crosses and not just finding
a good phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually looking for flavor
profiles and cannabinoid profiles and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting what they want out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that has to do with the way they
do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the new seed breeders are really
community-friendly and dispersing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to a lot of people and allowing them
to perform their methods of growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: find different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an occasional secret meeting at a
place in Denver where a few of us are
[SPEAKER_03]: chosen to meet at this mansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Kingdom of Quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mile High Seeds?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mile High is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laplata Labs is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sin City goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Chronic shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of us breeders, iogenetics goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all take packages of our newest shit or
whatever, our secret weapon, and we trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mile High has given me his Apollo Times
Brothers Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give him my grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trade packs of seeds around the
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to keep it together with each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of trying to compete, we're trying
to be like, well, here, bro, here's some
[SPEAKER_03]: face-off OG for some heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you don't need a bank account.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a few of our favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy some seeds from reputable breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am iogenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, since it's hard to get
iogenetics seeds, Gage Green is one of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use Gage Green for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get into a breeding stuff
and you want a reliable male, I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: believe I'm fucking telling the world
this, but Gage Green is a good place to
[SPEAKER_03]: find a nice, reliable male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true shit right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how friendly I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: But be careful with your breeding because
you can still fuck up even with that good
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much I like you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You listen to my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bag seeds are fun, but they're not as
reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bag seeds are seeds that you find in weed,
of course, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not as reliable as something you'd
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want something with specific parents
bred for certain traits like Kevin was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of cool that he touched on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first option is bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's shit that you of course found in
that kush that you bought from that guy in
[SPEAKER_03]: the park and it had a seed in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep a close eye on any bag seed
because it could be a male or it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: a hermaphrodite.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's got a yard full of herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're in a legal state,
you can possibly get seeds at a dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: or a co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the shops in California,
Colorado, Washington, and Michigan have
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from reputable breeders available on
the shelves and the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost everywhere in the Pacific Northwest
has fucking TGA subcool seeds all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the shops in Colorado,
you can pick up yourself some rare
[SPEAKER_03]: dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan's got, oddly enough, they've got
Gage Green Genetics because our friend
[SPEAKER_03]: Yankee trolls up and down the East Coast
there and takes care of them with the Gage
[SPEAKER_03]: Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a Gage Green rep and he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are seeds on shops and shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also pick up seeds at cannabis
events like the Cannabis Cup and Hemfest
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever else is happening this month
because there seems to be an event every
[SPEAKER_03]: damn month now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The breeders go.
[SPEAKER_03]: They set up a tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little bit of research online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out what you should be paying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expect to pay about a hundred bucks for a
10 pack of seeds, honestly, between 60 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 120, but about a hundred bucks for a 10
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before you go to the events,
go and find out what you want and then go
[SPEAKER_03]: there and see if you can find those
breeders and you'll have a little shopping
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a little easier for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are only viable options if you
live in or if you can travel to a legal
[SPEAKER_03]: state like Colorado or to Hemfest,
which is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be over by the time you hear this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may not be an option for most of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, you're going to need to
order your seeds on online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're in the United States,
I strongly recommend naturesgreenremedies
[SPEAKER_03]: .com.
[SPEAKER_03]: My company has a great working
relationship with Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm friends with most of the breeders
stocked on Nature's Green Remedies and I
[SPEAKER_03]: trust everyone that I've done business
with involved with Nature's Green
[SPEAKER_03]: Remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I strongly recommend
naturesgreenremedies.com for seeds in the
[SPEAKER_03]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, expect to pay around a
hundred dollars for a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you get a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some brands are a little cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are slightly higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Femini seeds often run a little more
expensive because they're harder to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get way less Femini seeds out of a
breeding project than you do regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes more space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes more energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course we want more money for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not charge my regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: My Femini seeds are the same price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I charge the same price all the way
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature's Green Remedies uses discrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's discrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means they don't write.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are seeds on the package.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature's Green Remedies uses discrete
priority shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know your seeds will arrive in just
a few short days.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to pass through customs
and get held up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take all kinds of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, America.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right here in America.

[SPEAKER_03]: That was interesting watching you do
fucking redneck sign language over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to figure out what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like giving monkeys tools for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not my joke anyway, giving monkeys
tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like watching monkeys use tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where I heard it,
but that's not mine.

that was pollinated by a Gage Green
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows... There are phenos that look
like the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are phenos that look like the
Daybreaker and there's one right in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's almost no leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows big, long fan leaves and no leaf,
so you don't have to trim it.

[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that lasts for one week,

[SPEAKER_04]: Drinking a dab is an order.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when you message me and you're
like, everything was one take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, did you breathe through it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually my next question is like,
did you take a breath?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oxygen intake, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that everything's rolling good
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 25 episodes in, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're learning how to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have endured 25 episodes,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first 24, I'm not so sure about.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is still not even guaranteed to
be any good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to have faith in your product,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys must be liking it because the
Facebook, the Instagram, the Twitter,
[SPEAKER_03]: my email, they've all been blowing up
lately regarding the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, regarding everything, I read
genetics, the podcast, life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has been going well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you got fish coming up in a
few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got tickets for that freaking
oddball comedy show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at the prices for those and I was
like, yeah, I'm probably not going to that
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get the reserve seating at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even look at those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the ones underneath those.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: 63 is a little bit much for me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to pay some bills before that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we just paid all the bills here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got something in my nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I sneeze on the show, it'll be the
second time I've ever sneezed on a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is episode 25 and it feels like a
milestone in the podcast world.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that your show isn't anywhere
until you've done 25 episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say don't expect any listener
interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't expect a tweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't expect a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't expect a five star review,
at least until you've gotten 25 episodes
[SPEAKER_03]: under your belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have to give a little bit of
respect to the podcast that helped me get
[SPEAKER_03]: my feet wet and learn how to do
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 719 the blocks podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: No disrespect to those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to end that relationship or not
that relationship, that podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have time for that shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of where I got my feet wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the podcast dancer, man, dude,
you taught me a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you don't listen to my show,
but Cliff Ravenscraft taught me a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: about podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since we're doing all that,
I should send some love to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kevin, of course,
Adam, Tony, Clint, Jesse, Spencer,

[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I didn't miss anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did, please know that I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab the fuck out and I'm on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's time to take a celebration dab
because episode 25 is going well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the shout outs done, we got the
commercials done, we got the contest out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel good after giving all those people
a shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of people, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That covers most everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna give one special shout out to
fuckin' toughest dude I know, Pops,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fuckin' is beatin' shit and it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he might show up here tonight
for the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, big shout out to Pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big shout out to Joffertain,
Kara Pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops was really battlin'.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we say what Pops was workin' with,
Pops?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops had lung cancer and he looked like
hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops looked like a skeleton several months
ago and with the little treatments from
[SPEAKER_03]: his doctor, not little treatments,
fuckin' big ass treatments from his doctor
[SPEAKER_03]: that almost plowed the shit out of Pops
and the love from Kevin and the nurturing
[SPEAKER_03]: from Kevin and also the help of cannabis,
Pops looks like a freakin' million buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: The help from Jeff and Irie and the whole
cannabis community, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of people that gave free
donations just to help out his cause
[SPEAKER_02]: because he couldn't smoke anymore and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gained weight throughout his entire
treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only bad news we received was the
original cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has done a lot for the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's made sure he could eat and kept him
going through all those hard times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard treatments and we're just waitin' on
the scan next month to see what the final
[SPEAKER_02]: answer is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he says he has more energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He feels better than he has in over three
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of yourselves, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to thank the community for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little came from me, to be quite
honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought what I could, but I was limited
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of free things from a lot of
good people and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what this community's for.
[SPEAKER_03]: As growers and breeders, if you're doin'
it right, you do okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta pay it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta kick it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guys notice that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try not to be stingy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only been here a couple months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say that it's one thing
hearing about it from internet and other
[SPEAKER_05]: sources and things like that, but seeing
it for yourself, it's great, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What he's speaking is the truth out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to give a huge thanks to Joey from
Natural Mystic Caregivers and Selecta
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicotibol.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fuckin' hooked it up with oil
capsules that went directly to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Essential Caps, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Essential Caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of good things about
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have paid sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essential Caps didn't pay anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a lot of good things about
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Mystic Caps from Joey,
I ran into him just leaving, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into him right in the middle of two
places and I kinda told him how I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doin' and he asked about my dad,
because he had met him before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told him and he reached in his bag
and gave me some of those Mystic Caps that
[SPEAKER_02]: won the Cannabis Cup Award.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give these to your dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been amazing, the love and
support I've gotten from everybody and the
[SPEAKER_02]: love that's gone to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: The community really works like that,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you show it love, it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives you love back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had another friend, I don't know if he
wants me to shout him out on a podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a friend of a friend came down with
stage four liver cancer and was in deep
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually looked worse than Pops looked
and I'm not trying to level any shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the only thing that was gonna work for
this cat was RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I posted on Facebook, I need some RSO
and I got it within five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It delivered from Leadville.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, I was fuckin' eight or nine
hours away from here to just a friend of a
[SPEAKER_03]: friend who was in need.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's compassionate care right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew it wasn't for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew that that was for that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't askin' for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, we got it,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooked him up, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody out there, this shout out's for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hook up medical patients,
if you don't charge your medical patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you give medical patients extra,
I know you gotta recoup your light fees,
[SPEAKER_03]: you gotta pay for your soil, you gotta do
that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge them the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are hookin' up cancer patients
with RSO, if you're doin' that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, you know who you are if you deserve
a shout out for this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a medical provider, big love,
respect, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a shout out for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't get enough attention paid
to you, you don't get enough love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys are just ballin' out
lookin' like gangsters livin' off the
[SPEAKER_03]: caregiver life, but some of you guys are
doin' it proper, and mad love for that,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's hard to do it proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growin' that medical grade herb with no
sprays, no crazy shit on it is definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna keep the grow lessons comin' and
shit, and I always do episodes with news.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys wanna hear me talk about
something, something random, something
[SPEAKER_03]: like this guy, the whole seed topic today
just happened to be good timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a giveaway planned, and that guy
asked about where to get seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: so now hopefully he's listening to episode
25, and he can get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he knows the laws and regulations in
the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't even have to buy some irie
genetics products right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his email said he's in California,
so he's cool to grow herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got that 215, and it's legal out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he doesn't have to even buy irie
genetics products.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can go buy some rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some La Plata.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some La Plata.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Durango OG, if they've got that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit in stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That alien... Lemon alien?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon alien?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's available anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's available,
but it looked ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Gage Green Genetics, Scarlett Cush,
or Starlet Cush, or Asperer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to call... Oh, there it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm better now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should've just let it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But go get some of those, and then use
that coupon code episode25.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all one word, capital E, and then the
number 25, episode 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a free five pack of irie gear,
and I don't want anything except your
[SPEAKER_03]: loyal listenership, which is pretty
awesome.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to hear me talk about some
shit, just tweet me, message me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll discuss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wondered what I was doing with the
recording gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my fucking... Somebody point to
this paper, and I'll just start reading
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure where you were on that
paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can message me at iGrowCulture
on hotmail.com, or you can tweet me at
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrowCulture, or you can find me on
Facebook under iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want me to say your name on
the show, just let me know in your
[SPEAKER_03]: message, and I'll keep your identity
private.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I got to keep some people on
Texas and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't let anybody know they're growing
and shit, so I won't bust you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you leave a comment on iTunes or
Stitcher, I'll try to read those on a
[SPEAKER_03]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Task Rock for the song
that's playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a couple minutes to kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got a topic you want to bring up?
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a couple topics earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Springs has banned the use of
butane extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to celebrate the banning of
butane extraction by taking a fat,
[SPEAKER_03]: chunky dad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for your thing, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of details on it,
so there's not a lot to say about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, for those who haven't caught the
message yet, Colorado Springs has put a
[SPEAKER_02]: moratorium on butane extraction,
including in a closed loop system,
[SPEAKER_02]: and under all these new regulations that
have been put on the extraction labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you dump that down just a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're saying no more blasting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do it open, which are the new
regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have closed loop system and a
certain type of environment under certain
[SPEAKER_02]: code and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they're outlawing even that in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently what it was is one guy
from, I forget his name, from some
[SPEAKER_02]: building department or something in
Springs kind of decided that these
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical codes and certain things were
not sufficient to even have a closed loop
[SPEAKER_02]: system in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here the industry is, there's a lot of
people making new rooms and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: under all these new codes that follow all
these guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy just came in and said that
wasn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently this department has final
say over fire department and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys hear that cough in the
background, that's Adam being a big sissy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're working to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the guy, from what I
understand, is going to tell the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: what he wants as his regulations or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may be, like the video I saw,
they said it may be a week, it may be a
[SPEAKER_02]: year before this is fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just never know with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just happened yesterday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's very minimal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, open blasting is actually
technically illegal anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is only relating to dispensary OPC
grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So state regulated, MED regulated grows
that are blasting their, it's not even
[SPEAKER_03]: blasting anymore at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's processing in a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of those legal MED regulated
MIPS, OPC regulated blasting sites,
[SPEAKER_03]: processing facilities, I guess we'll call
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of those do you think or know of
in Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know of two for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's probably a couple more just
because some of the dispensaries have
[SPEAKER_02]: their own MIPS license and stuff that they
can process under.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know two for sure and one's fairly
new to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they just spent a lot of money
building their shit for licensing and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's getting shut down now,
which is, that's- They can still run their
[SPEAKER_02]: garden, but they can't extract it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still run CO2, you can still run
some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can the garden that we're talking
about, that a garden in Springs that was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens guys, if you're listening
from, we've got a listener that listens in
[SPEAKER_03]: London.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to keep in mind that- Respect,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to keep in mind that not
everybody, my mic sounds funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's just the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to keep in mind that not everybody
knows Colorado shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: These places grow a large garden,
like a thousand plants, and they harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they run all of that through a
closed loop butane extraction machine and
[SPEAKER_03]: turn all of it into hash, into BHO,
dabs, shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Processed marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sells for somewhere between,
depending on where and who, between 30 and
60 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're getting into live resin,
it's 85 to $100.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these guys are making large portions
and portioning it up into grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they deliver it back to the
dispensary and then the dispensary sells
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the dispensary takes their grow that
they have leftovers of and sends it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction company for them to blast or
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they take all of that product
back to the shop and sell it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these guys are growing large,
large gardens just for processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I see them doing, you run your
large garden, you chop it, you dry it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you drive it up to Denver to your
processing facility or down to Pueblo to
[SPEAKER_03]: your processing facility where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you run it there and then you
just have to drive twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is forcing closed loop systems,
correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, closed loops have been banned also
in Colorado Springs as part of this
[SPEAKER_03]: moratorium.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the closed loop system is what the
industry standard is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot blast open loop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this not doing anything but like
upgrading the hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it kind of sounds negative when
it's coming from YouTube, but to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: it sounds like more people are going to be
making unicorn hash and we're going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: away from the butane nasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they just banned, you can't even
make unicorn hash now, which is a live
[SPEAKER_03]: residue, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't do any of it in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to drive the black market
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now guys like Laura, like guys that are
unlicensed, like me, I'm a grower and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to make the dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I let other people do that for
me, but I'm going to have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I live in Colorado Springs,
I can't get it now because it's not being
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go in my backyard and
open blast my own product, which is taking
[SPEAKER_03]: it back to where it was that caused a lot
of the problems in the first place.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what prohibition does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just trying to reprohibit
prohibition.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Springs is kind of a strange city
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: For being such a big city, they've banned
all the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're banning blasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of military up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to mention the event being
pushed back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Daniel for making this
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, big up to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody is mad about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard any bad reviews on this
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen anything on it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pushed the mountain region back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was a community decision to
some extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just Big D going, no,
I'm fucking doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not how he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like doing it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, they had just wrapped up the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beast coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Bobby Nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently that was bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some pretty high numbers and some
pretty high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after that, Secret Cup administrators
decided that they needed to make Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: the home state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret Cup administrators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Big D and Jeremy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: As bad ass as the beast coast was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't feel like they could do
that within like a week and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have had several venue changes,
several issues with Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the venues they could get locked down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they finally have a good venue locked
down and they're getting everything else
[SPEAKER_02]: squared away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they pushed it back to the end of
September.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's still happening and they want
to just make it bad ass and not half ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good job on that decision for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll leave more time for people to get
ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Big D offered to pay any expenses
that were extra incurred on people who had
[SPEAKER_02]: already had plane tickets that had to
trade a man or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had posted right on Facebook that said,
just prove to me what you're out and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: take care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to back out of the competition
or whatever, I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can refund that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, he offered to fucking pay
airline fees for changing tickets if there
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's pretty cool,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Big D.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you guys are trying to come to
the Secret Cup, the date has been changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they announced the new date?
[SPEAKER_02]: September 27th or something, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced like the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said we'll probably pin down a date
as it gets closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how they do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He may have the date right, but I didn't
really look since it's been pushed back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say the 27th, 28th.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool because before it was the same
day as a Phish concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, but Phish won.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll be that Saturday and Sunday,
the 27th and 28th of September.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got any, any plugs you want to
do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more you want anybody to check out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody you want to fucking mention while
you got your airtime?

[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Diamond Dave and the
Compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up Diamond Dave?
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck with Dave, man.

[SPEAKER_04]: Like, God, you're so fun to mess with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ups to our friends that are crushing
it in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a large grow facility in Clark
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name on a podcast or not, but he knows who
[SPEAKER_03]: he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got that Hells Angel OG that tested
at 30% THC.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
