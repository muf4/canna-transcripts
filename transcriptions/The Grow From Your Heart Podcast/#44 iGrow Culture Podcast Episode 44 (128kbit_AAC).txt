[SPEAKER_03]: Like reggae until they bounce down a
couple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear it's fucking, uh, fucking disco
music at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 44 of the I
Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super special episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, on the mic over there to my left is a
super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Flair's over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my super high buddy, Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought Adam on the show because for
some reason we're not going to get too far
[SPEAKER_01]: into why, but for some reason we call Adam
44 in our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a special number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across the table from me is our
good buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're talking to me or
the podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll answer for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone's ever asked you
how's it going on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm drinking Yerba Mate and I got two of
my best friends at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to complain about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super happy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, speaking of Mate, I'm going to reach
over and take a sip.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you guys say something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm right there with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's been a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that wasn't very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give the mic to Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stumble over shit and sit here and
talk to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Words were coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better than silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead air is what you don't want,
but it eats.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to take it, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam's going to stop talking now and I'm
going to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn Adam's mic up and turn
down the music a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so uh, let's, uh, I'm going to tease a
little bit coming up in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to read a little bit about
some Seth Rogen stuff.

[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, his idea backfired.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an article from president Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might've been another news
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the natives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about some stuff that may
happen on Indian reservations pretty soon
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting for that announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

day.

camera that had all that data on the wall.

[SPEAKER_01]: There are spots in the back.

[SPEAKER_01]: I got your state wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did, uh, I'm in Colorado and those
two states, Arizona and Nevada are the big
[SPEAKER_01]: desert down there.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope, I do hope you guys have time
to, uh, message me when you're coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado to Pueblo and we'll visit,
we'll link up, maybe take some dabs.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big love and much respect to all the
sponsors for making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, big shout out to the mystic roots
band, coot dog and cat and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mystic roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me play their, all of their
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've given me full permission for their
whole catalog on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps a guy out trying to run a show
and keep things fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a song called the doggy
dub for the intro for the past couple
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's instrumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice flow to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of got my vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for letting me use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a stitcher comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to read the stitcher or the
stitcher and iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an iTunes comment from our good
friend, Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Fred?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said great show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, thanks to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Jesse were talking about that the
other day that stitcher really needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: get on that, that comment section thing
where it just, it needs to be linked right
[SPEAKER_00]: to you or maybe somewhere where somebody
else can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just the looker, not maybe a user
that has to log in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't comment from a mobile device on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find any way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stitcher get on that you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's how I listen every single
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's a lot of what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you guys on Stitcher,
uh, want to leave a comment, I apologize
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can't, but you can go to the I
grow culture Facebook page and log in and
[SPEAKER_01]: leave a comment or you can just simply
email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to read your email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that just as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want me to read it on the show,
I certainly will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The YouTube is another place where you can
go and comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not all the episodes are up,
but you know, they will be catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been keeping myself still put
something down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like episode 35 was did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's there for everybody to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to have a YouTube account
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the reasons that you put it
up on that market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read genetics site too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can comment too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like it if you guys, if you're a
listener that listens a lot and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to interact, if you go to the I read
genetics Colorado website, join the forum,
[SPEAKER_01]: make yourself a profile on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to one of my posts or go start a new
post.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will interact with you for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, usually on Monday or Tuesday nights
when I get all my work done, I want to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: back, take some dads, I dab out and go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forum and just post pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, post a lot of pictures of my crop
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff on there that
doesn't make it to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and one thing that's cool is they
can't filter me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Tony and I built that Tony built
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drew it in crayon pretty much on a
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is what I want the
homepage to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I drew tabs at the top and then I
was like, this is what I want the second
[SPEAKER_01]: page to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kind of did my vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a work in progress, you know,
but for what I drew, he nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I joined it when he first launched it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's about all I've done as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just go click like on some shit and
put some traffic on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was the one that found out that I
had a karma deal or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got that worked out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to give a huge thanks to
everyone who sent me messages and comments
[SPEAKER_01]: from episode 43.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got more response off episode 40,
uh, 35 and 43 have been our most popular
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 was drying and curing with Jesse and I
and 43 was organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So King Cola will definitely, definitely
be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, huge thanks to King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean, if you're listening, thanks a lot,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of questions for you
from a listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants me to relay a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to get you back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a few too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a ton of response from it as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to, uh, Rocky Mountain worm
company, uh, is going to definitely see
[SPEAKER_01]: some results for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go down there and get myself
a, I've got some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are going to transplant into larger
pots here within the next five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will definitely be getting fed
Rocky Mountain warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an opportunity there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, um, you guys tell them
that you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them that people are here in Colorado
or supporting them and not as they've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually commented on the podcast that
they listened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be, uh, well that's what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have a wormy sponsor here in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard of it, you know,
and I'm, I'm with these guys most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of one of their like little
health secrets, but then they blasted it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's not held secret,
but it's just, you got to know Sean's
[SPEAKER_01]: secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all Sean's brought that to the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody from the garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mentioned that the garden of Whedon
may be on here, uh, to talk about their
[SPEAKER_01]: secret cup experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they just got back from Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, they did not take home the
trophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some coastal guys won some guys from
the coast, which, you know, you can handle
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not bitter about it, although they
were busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the garden of Whedon was a little bit
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over there hanging out today and I
was like, you want to come on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of showed me what they had
to take care of and kind of hinted at me
[SPEAKER_01]: that today was not the day to come on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future we'll have spins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can get Maddie over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie's never been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, no, she hasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get Maddie over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Big Mike will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the first female on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'd be an honor to have it either
Maddie or Angela and I've invited Angela
[SPEAKER_01]: and she doesn't seem excited to talk on
the show, which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a podcast person,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But busy is the word of the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's been busy the couple of weeks
just to get everybody to pull out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives for an hour to come do the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but let's look at,
you know, like he'd been sick just there
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been, he's good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he looks good now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's put, Spence was down to like 140
pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's six foot four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 140 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's almost back to a normal weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just glad to hear that he made it
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you eat can eat buffets.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talking about some of the banging
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they had a French toast at some
place and I was like, let's get in a car,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go make some bomb French toast.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, we'll go over to Jesse's later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send a huge shout out to Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey got a hoodie from me today and I
hadn't seen Joey in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of nice to hook up with
Joey, get him a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look sharp in that hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm wrapping up shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I got a lot of them here at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to get them out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, much respect and much thanks and much
love to Mike, Adam and Angela.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they trimmed their little fingers off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Angela's little fingers might not
have normal size.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's beastly at it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, I don't know how the little chick
trims faster than anybody else I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela is, I will say it on the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela is the fastest trimmer I've ever
fucking known.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one guy I know that might keep up,
but he takes at her all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know a guy that might keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't compete if you're enhancing,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she's taking, she's dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, giving people shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela is involved in this shout out
again, but huge shout out to Angela,
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegas, Craig, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got to give you a huge shout out to
the spot dispensary in Pueblo West,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've treated me super kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in a couple of talks,
a couple of meetings and things have
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think I'm ready to make the official
announcement today in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I received my Colorado med badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now officially legally licensed to
work in a Colorado medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, which means that at this time I
can take the job that I've been offered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now the official master grower at the
spot in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the next few months,
um, there's a little bit of work to be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the grow site to get it up to what I
want and what we are expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are over 200 lights in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be the master grower for those 200
lights, which means that in probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say six months, I want to
give myself six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys will see fire coming out of there
produced by Rasta Jeff out of the spot in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to announce that when I'm
proud to be a part of that team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I was a little picky about where I
wanted to go, what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people have offered me things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like their grow and I get along with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be a great, a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my girlfriend is the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I am the master grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my girlfriend is the trimmer also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll go from, it'll have my love in it
all the way from the seed or the clone all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way up to the time it reaches the
customer and or patients container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to have Rasta Jeff love from
beginning to end now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm proud to work with the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my big announcement that I've been
kind of teasing about on social media and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I want to compliment the Colorado MED
in spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody made it sound like it was a big
deal to go get your med badge and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a tax issue from my past that I had
to clear up and I had to get a noted paper
[SPEAKER_01]: that my child support was current and
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I already did that because I knew that
was coming and they never asked for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they said that they would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they never asked for those papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, so in Colorado Springs, you're able to
call and make an appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardest part is getting the
appointment call every day until you get
[SPEAKER_01]: an appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I had to call three times in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called me back after the third one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set an appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got there early.
[SPEAKER_01]: She saw I was early.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took me right when I got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got me out of there within 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My full appointment was 30 minutes,
uh, giving her the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: She reviewed the paper and it's one lady
that's there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could remember her name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was excited and anxious, so I don't even
know what she looks like to tell you the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go into that fucking concert mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see this and get it done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Med lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, med lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they take your fingerprints on the
digital fingerprinter, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they run all your background
checks and then they take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a picture of you and she high
fives you and tells you, have a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened Tuesday at 11 o'clock
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got my mail, it is Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we record my med badge came in the mail
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my background check, my tax thing,
all my child support, my fingerprints,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything got done probably within five
or six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hands down the, the fastest turn turnover
rate I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with everything I needed because I
called and asked, I was like, what am I
[SPEAKER_01]: going to need?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like, I have, I have a small
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have child support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to choose like, as long as your
child support is current and you can prove
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as your taxes are good on your
small business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I got that watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had to, I, they never asked for
proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they probably could tell just by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of their app, their application was
13 pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think seven of those pages are you
signing, writing your name, signing and
[SPEAKER_01]: dating, saying that this agency can go
through all of my shit and this agency can
[SPEAKER_01]: go through all of my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I missed anything, this other
agency can go through all the other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like everything but your medical
records.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get reviewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think your money, your criminal,
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she puts on a rubber glove.
[SPEAKER_01]: She puts on a rubber glove and says,
you want to come back here with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just fingerprinting you at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, they're going that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why everybody talks about how bad
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're getting the wrong treatment
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were just nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I cannot say I had that experience,
but no, I got mine right before the first
[SPEAKER_03]: of the year last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet that there was a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now in screens you can make
appointments and they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sticklers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will tell you if you miss your
appointment, it'll be a while before you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get back because you go to the bottom
of the list and you're like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I'm prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left an hour and a half early to get to
45 minute drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: My puppy ate my badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10 bucks for a replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you need an appointment for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told me I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not take cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you ever go into the med,
go get a money order for the total.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's anything pretty much here except
for like that office in Springs isn't in a
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty area, but parts of Springs right
near like Colorado Springs on one side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the street is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side of the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I don't want to fucking park
my car here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of in one of those like
off to the side areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be, I wouldn't wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could easily be a victim of robbery
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's wise that they don't keep a lot of
cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my badge alone was 300 bucks and they
probably do 20 appointments a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 150 or $300 per appointment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Price went up for that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 150 for the key or 150 for the
support and 300 for the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get the key because I'm the guy
in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the prices doubled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're upgrading badges,
it's still like 253 bucks to go from one
[SPEAKER_01]: to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you should have just paid that in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, if you're curious, if you need to
get the big badge or the little one,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can afford it, just get the big
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes you a more valuable asset too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually ask for more pay if you
have that longer badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a good episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess we just did it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short end of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of Colorado listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll back up a couple steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to apply to be able to
work in the medical marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the marijuana industry, you can take the
medical word out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be employed in any way in
the marijuana industry in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you need to do is go to, there's a
website, it's the- The department of
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue, Colorado department of revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be marijuana documents on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Print out the application for,
it's a med employment application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the business application.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only the one for an employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll say key or support, which is how
you know if you're doing the right ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the, just go for that key or
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to be like a manager or
something, if you just want to trim or bud
[SPEAKER_01]: tent, all you need is a support.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to get paid a little more,
and if you want to have some chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: climbing up that corporate ladder,
get that big one, get that support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they always have to have a support
badge on premises.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if boss needs to go somewhere,
maybe you can step up and show that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how people advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go on the website, print out that
application, read it thoroughly before you
[SPEAKER_01]: even start printing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's one page that says,
if any of this stuff applies to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pretty much says, if you did this,
you cannot get a badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's straight up no, like just read your
application now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primarily, it's kind of the same stuff as
getting into the military.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no drug felonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No drug felonies is their main one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have had the list here,
but I didn't realize we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all that's all that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically common sense at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can, if you're in another state
or whatever, just to clarify, like this
[SPEAKER_00]: means like to work behind a counter,
selling herb to people, selling cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this doesn't mean you can't live in
Colorado and can't have three plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: six plants, whatever the state,
that's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still be a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still grow your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just to work in a regulated shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Become part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I hate saying this,
but it's what I feel and what I,
[SPEAKER_01]: part of why I'm making the business
decisions I'm making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that in the future,
iRegenetics will be able to breed inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of this large facility that I've just
been, became master grower of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, if I don't make a move like
that, the way that I'm growing and the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that my business model works, I think the
industry will squeeze me right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I either need to join it or get squeezed
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my way to join it and not
disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be here for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've thought about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm selling out a little bit,
but I'd rather give than not exist at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right guys, if you get that
application, fill it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not in Colorado, you got to come
to Colorado and you have to show
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go to a bunch of dispensaries
and apply in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be kind of persistent,
almost be an asshole about it because so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people apply every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a hot chick, you're going to get
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know a little bit about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come with some knowledge and be willing to
start at a shitty job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be willing to clean the toilets and trim
pot for eight hours a day because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what we need mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimmers get paid decently here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And be dependable, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such a high turnover rate in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing that kind of looks bad
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't brag about your trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell me you can trim a pound and
show up and not be able to trim it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're on your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're on your phone all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many people from around the
world that want in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't perform at a top notch,
we'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say we, I just got into this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll kick the fuck right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of people that hit the wall
every day and then they get paid and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like, I'm rich and I'm around
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just drop out like flies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a, it may be a cool job,
but it is still very much a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visit dispensaries here in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I go in there every week and
nobody's there or it's different people in
[SPEAKER_00]: there every week, different employees,
no customers, bunny of customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, you know, recreational and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's always lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going to the spa.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a couple of reasons recently,
mostly to talk to the owners out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: the bosses and to see if we can negotiate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also my favorite person, a second
favorite person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a daughter, sorry, girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're second.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daughter comes first.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's just kind of picking on you,
but she's out there and I go out there to
[SPEAKER_01]: visit her and go take her lunch or just go
see what's up and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for her to get away from the
counter because they've got business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to go and sit down behind
a counter and be like socializing with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would, you would think that,
you know, you still have to have customer
[SPEAKER_00]: service, but it's, you have 14 people out
and like I'll be waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I told the bosses there that I
don't want to budtend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, I'd rather not be a budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just rather stick with being the
grower, you know, cause there'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: downtime for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think once in a while, just for fun
and I'll announce it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, Hey guys, and I'm not,
I don't mean this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is just hypothetical and
I'm not even going to say it like a real
[SPEAKER_01]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say on this day, I will be budtending
at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to come and buy some
Capelten from Ross to Jeff, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: the agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you 10% off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's going to be happening pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of stuff that we have in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got my foot in the medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, well, I started helping transplant
somebody, helping somebody transplant that
[SPEAKER_01]: had their own shop and too many plants and
couldn't handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw him struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you need help?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, you know how I was like,
fuck you, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, grab a bucket, do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was older than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to work circles around him
and he's like, come back tomorrow and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: pay you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me way more than I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for the rest of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, all right, this works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of how I got my first job in it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, I guess that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go show that you can do some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show some initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the weed industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to think I can show up
with my long hair down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to take a shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could put on my grateful dead shirt,
my fucked up jeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still got to treat it like a real
job interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying we because I've got my own
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I can qualify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather you kind of just show up and
maybe show some initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody would come in and sit at the
table and not do anything the whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: and not show any initiative, then they
probably wouldn't be there on the next
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the tremors that were here,
there were three tremors here for like
[SPEAKER_01]: four nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of stressful for all three
of those people to take four nights out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their lives and come trim pot for me with
me helping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have called two or three other
people, but I liked and trusted everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: here and I could have driven to the store
and came back and nothing would have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I keep the people that I keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working in the weed industry,
we want some clean people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're around stuff that people are
consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the MED is a stickler for dirtiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse just shook his head and rolled his
eyes because he knows the MED is kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys for giving me my badge,
but you guys have some crazy fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shots fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking a lot about a lot of
good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some semi sad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are ready for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is rumor that the podcast will
receive a cease and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can continue to podcast, but not under
the name I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has sent me anything yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of businesses and podcasts and
YouTube and Facebook and Instagram things
[SPEAKER_01]: have been being forewarned that a business
called I Grow, which is a college
[SPEAKER_01]: institution that does college
horticultural stuff is coming after people
[SPEAKER_01]: using the I Grow moniker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem changing the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to do it slowly if it does
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to do it preemptively
before I actually get a cease and desist
[SPEAKER_01]: letter in the mail or email to me or
however it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd just be responsible and kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's their name and they've got it,
I don't really feel like I want to rip
[SPEAKER_01]: them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought it was cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Kevin and I came up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, it's like, I wanted to use the
I because it's the modern I Grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: iPhone, iPod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the I world and it's I Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening, you're learning to grow
from me on your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a play on the word agriculture is
what we thought also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the I Grow Culture, but we're
going to have to change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know what the name will become.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't decided for sure that I want to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may just do it on December 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go I Grow Culture slash this podcast
for a month or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: For when people get used to it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we may have to change the name,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still be the same show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's going to change but the logo and
the title.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Bender, if you're listening,
bro, the new title of the show will be The
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have just relayed that to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with the listeners, if you guys
are listening now and this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: disappears, look for The Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be the same feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can type in the title on the feed and
change the feed in my website stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything will be legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll all stay the same other than the
words.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bender, help me out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make it up to you somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got to pay it out, bro,
we'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart Podcast or The Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you want to do it, like a heart
with maybe some herb coming out of it or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, red, gold, and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: He nailed it last time, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nailed that last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last logo was dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart kind of looks like a seed split
and open, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jesse, Jesse just hit gold over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A heart of a seed split and open,
a little sprout coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sprout with the two leaves being the
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, Jesse's on this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever can do some art.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado and you're an adult
and you can find me face to face,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay you in seeds or herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will gift you seeds and herb in return
for making me this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't pay you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can gift you shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally give you a gift of kindness
to say, and you can also give me a gift of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sweet ass logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kindness you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not 21 and you're not in
Colorado, I'll get you like an iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt if I have your size in stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you something fucking cool from
Colorado to make it up for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also need a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging, but I need a logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get the community,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when it's community made nine
times out of 10, you'll probably get a
[SPEAKER_00]: flood of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be like, help me pick this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys send theme songs, Grow From
Your Heart podcast, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start saying that pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be... Well, that way
people can start hearing it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to talk to that other
company that owns the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a phrase you told me one of the
first times we like sat down and like
[SPEAKER_03]: really talked about growing and breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow from your heart?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breed from your heart, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed with love and grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been preaching those things for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those have always been kind of... Oh,
that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes your wife and your cannabis
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing that, you're a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow cannabis and
you're not starting and just like sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room 24-7, just like on your hands
and knees, cross-legged, like Indian
[SPEAKER_00]: style, like loving on them, then you're
not getting this part of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got to get people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most people are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of you guys that are listening
will... You already know because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, these are one of those times that we
were talking about where I say something
[SPEAKER_00]: dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going to critique what you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
See?
[SPEAKER_01]: He can go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really like to pick on Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extreme enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam likes to get picked on it,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite things to do,
Adam likes to start our rant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: he'll stare at you as he does it,
waiting for you to reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you don't reply, he just puts his
foot deeper in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like... And then you look at him
like, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be the perfect time right
then to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he has three more things that he
really wants to cram in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bury into the dirt to make you think like,
Jesus Christ, what is wrong with this
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole?
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is when we're in the car and
he just starts doing it and he doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if I'm silent because he's being a
dipshit or if I'm just driving or what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, no, no reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see what's going to come
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can he top that shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: He always does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always manages to top his own foot in
his mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we keep you around,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good for a laugh every now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either with me or at me one or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And either way, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working with him this last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some good laughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for real, you put food on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for the shout out this week,
you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys built a new a new play hut.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing in the dirt all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Screwing off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Denver Bud company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, going to their business plan is
to be able to buy their brand of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: in dispensaries all over the, all over the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they'll be opening sometime soon
when we're done building it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they got a few other hurdles after
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspections.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardest part in Colorado right now is
getting damn water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting water rights for your girl is a
big, big, big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a huge fricking grow today out of
south of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all around us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go out highway 96 towards Wetmore,
there's a huge road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just right up against the highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're chain link fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost like flicker your fingers
in it when you drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right up against the highway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know which one that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the one you guys saw down south.
[SPEAKER_03]: That place has a fricking airstrip on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say one of the neatest I have
seen is my boy Hanky B over at the greener
[SPEAKER_01]: side dispensary on the Stem Beach exit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still haven't seen this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a bunch of LED lights going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's not happening right now,
but last season, towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: season, they had LED lights and it made
that whole, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a 60 by a hundred foot greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 foot, or no, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: 120 is the length.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the width.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bigger than your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was filled with LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the sun set right at sunset,
it looked like aliens were invading for
[SPEAKER_01]: about a mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just this big purple ball.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a neat greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that forever flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to forever flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern altitude or hemisphere or
something like that is the model with all
[SPEAKER_03]: the bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing sings to you in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do have a couple of news articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 35 minutes in a great, crazy
rambling guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you like these episodes where we
just come and hang out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past couple of episodes have been
really intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my friend hippie nurse, I haven't
talked to you in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're still listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we haven't talked, just been busy,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she takes notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I hope this episode, I hope you
could put down your pan and just enjoy and
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out with us and maybe smoke a bowl or
take a dab and enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys want to take a dab together?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever, if you guys are listening,
people like it when they, when,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we all sit around and puff and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything went fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wire on the wires there.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that didn't happen in the recording
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we all, I hope it didn't either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's going to sound like my brain
exploded in my head and electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically, I think what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'd all just got hit by lightning
through the headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a news article too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, first time ever reading a news
article.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bear with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not reading it either, but I'll just
hit the points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so basically the, um, good old
Congress, which I believe acts as city
[SPEAKER_03]: council, kind of sort of of Washington DC
is, um, um, one of the congressmen is
[SPEAKER_03]: thrown in a, um, shit, I'm just trying to
gather up some information here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I've got it on my screen if you
want me to read it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take this one dab news articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually, uh, did you find it on the
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, huff post is where I got it,
but I saw it on the cannabis this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take this quick dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some live resin from the garden of
Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, uh, let me read you the proper
names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Serious fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, not the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab is not bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article we're going to read is
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dab is fucking for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, uh, the, uh, dab is some serious
fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gorilla haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moonshine haze, uh, gorilla glue
number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were blasted together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the OB dose, OB dose,
OB dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to emo tech, dude, emo tech sent
me a brand new email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it running basically for a week
straight without turning it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned it off when I go to bed and shit,
but honestly I walk up, it's like my
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you wake up, I walk up and turn it
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend a lot of time sitting right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a lot of feature for the email
coffee pot timer time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be dope, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually put my old email on a timer
because I used to fall asleep with it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put her on a timer to shut off about
three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's got, uh, a fucking USB port
that I charge my phone on and it charges
[SPEAKER_01]: my iPhone so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I bet it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the higher temperature you
raise it up to probably connected to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to take this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, somebody tell me about, uh,
I'm sure I will hear Spencer check out a
[SPEAKER_03]: garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he just killed her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually Maddie did, um, but they both
did, uh, they just killed some government
[SPEAKER_03]: mule of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it was amazing looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a bunch of nice color too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite possibly one of the best rounds I've
ever seen of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I haven't got to grow that strain
inside as much as I would have liked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff they post is just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the cross on your government mule?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it is a G13, um, crossed with Tom
Hill's deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything he makes is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a little collaboration
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse is actually going to breed and I'm
going to put the seeds in iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_01]: packages and we're going to sell them as
iRegenetics products because I need some
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, will that be the government mule be
involved in that project?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That times, uh, OG mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally don't have a name for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, I'm not going to try to
make up some crazy name to, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: for this male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just say it's, it's a really good
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been proven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's made several crosses for some
small time breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it the OG male I think of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one we were talking about the other
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, you know, there's not
going to be anything fancy on the package
[SPEAKER_03]: in regards to, you know, it's just mystery
male or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the government meals, serious fire,
um, the two crossed together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's going to be, uh,
any, the government meals, real deep chunk
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to give your mail a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Gage calls his male, uh, Joseph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just got to name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs a cool name.
Henry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Henry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the Henry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the name of the mule that I grew
up next to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Henry the mule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear him every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit might have just accidentally
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm going to read this news
article, but first I want to remind
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, oh, that's fucking dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll burn off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emails love plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go ahead and push it right up against
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I was like soaring when I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just hit 10,000 Instagram followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you reminded me.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 Instagram followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All 10,000 of you, or at least the 150 of
you that like my pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is that all about,
dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can a guy get a goddamn like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got to think though,
you know, people just don't get on it all
[SPEAKER_00]: that often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually Instagram is going through
and cleaning up spam accounts and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: off all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I've been pitching on the show for
the past, by the way, guys, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrown your gov just because somebody,
I forgot somebody had taken that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so you've been pitching your Twitter
and somebody else's Twitter who has got
[SPEAKER_00]: like, 60 followers and hasn't posted in
two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would think if you went there and
it has nothing to do with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: then nothing to do with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly say, you properly say your
Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrown your gov. Overgrown your gov. Am
I even following you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, usually people find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's definitely happened,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we say your real name on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your full name?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Gaskins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call him gas cans when I call him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell him, I tell Siri, call Adam
Gaskins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what I heard when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what else is fun?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your phone, your Siri on a British
accent with a chick and it's hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call Adam Gaskins and she's all ringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of weird with that eye stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my eye devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple cult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, let's read this article that
Jesse kind of started to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Obama opposes congressional effort
to stop DC pot legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the picture, it looks like he's
clapping, but he's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this like weird facial
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this article is from, it just says
associated press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody gets any credit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AP that's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whoever wrote it, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't, nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says president president Barack Obama
plans to sign a $1.1 trillion government
[SPEAKER_01]: spending bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it reaches his desk, although he
opposed a provision blocking the district
[SPEAKER_01]: of Columbia from legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's frantically searching his phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be reading a different article.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to get that asshole
congressman's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, white house spokesman, Josh Ernest
said Thursday that despite reservations,
[SPEAKER_01]: Obama is set to sign legislation to fund
nearly the entire government through the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the budget year, September 30th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, district voters approved an initiative
November 4th to allow possession of up to
[SPEAKER_01]: two ounces of pot or up to three mature
plants for personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Language inserted by Republicans in the
spending bill would bar the city from
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward with legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernest says the president believes
Congress shouldn't interfere with the will
[SPEAKER_01]: of city voters on marijuana and other
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obama supports statehood for the district.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wrote a new budget proposal by
they, uh, it looks like the Republicans
[SPEAKER_01]: have submitted this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the wording, they also try to block
the legalization of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: district of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in the city, not in the state,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, you know, I know it's a
district, but you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's the whole state.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I read, it's going to be the
whole state, Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I was speaking as I read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may not block a provision block
district of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could definitely see like the
whole area around the white house and
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, like the presidential
land, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole district.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's what sucks is Obama would sort
of be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obama's down with DC being legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't write out his spokesperson says
they have to pass the budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to pass that budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find that cocksucker's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't he go out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can he just, he's a president,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't he just fucking erase that
line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wipe that shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to do with some kind of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I be the first one to say it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, go ahead and say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that he decriminalizes it at least
before he gets out, you know, because he
[SPEAKER_00]: was so, uh, I'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the raids and stuff while he was
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's still like, there's a war on
drugs still and this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, it's one of those
things that I feel like if he's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything that gives him a like on the
way out, it'll be something along that
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he can just bring it down to a new
substance law, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sucks because he's got to do
something before he leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to pass and a spokesperson
says, he believes Congress shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: interfere with the will of city voters on
marijuana and other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he supports statehood.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it does is it blocks any,
any congressional or city money being used
[SPEAKER_03]: to implement the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a shitty ultimatum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll gladly give it to you by the
droves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you not been paying attention?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to voting and then what the
voters vote for happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what happened to them?
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's like, uh, your parents telling
you, you go to a house party on Saturday
[SPEAKER_03]: when they damn well know you'll be in
Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's nothing I can do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the president's hands now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys in DC get to smoke your
recreational legal cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them so they won't have a store,
but they can still, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: fight the good fight guys, you know,
what they're doing is it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're encouraging the gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what I thought when I read the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a good place to be a
caregiver in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gray market is getting squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know pots super illegal or expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's not super illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super fucking expensive at the
dispensaries, but it seems like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from hanging out in the shop as much
as I have been lately, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that would rather just go,
go to the dispensary shop from the jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are like 12 strains on the shot on
the shelf at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, in my opinion, it's too
expensive, but that's cause I'm a spoiled
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow my own herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been paying really low prices for
several years now and to go there and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: double a little more than double what I'm
used to paying, but it's legal and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to sit in a cushy comfy chair and
listen to decent reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They play good reggae there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has nothing to do with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you sit in these cozy little chairs
and chill out and it's a chill
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to wait for your
dude to show up, if you just want to grab
[SPEAKER_01]: an eighth on the way home from work,
if you don't want to, because the deals
[SPEAKER_01]: are sketchy in a parking lot and shit,
you don't want to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be doing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I could see the black and gray
markets just be, and I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be, they would be totally wiped
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel if it was accessible in every
street corner, you know, almost like the
[SPEAKER_00]: damn liquor store where there's,
you know, 13 of them in town spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of, you know, 14 of them out there
in two mile area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's just hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys in states that are just about to
legalize or that are pushing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to get on top of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day it pops, you got to get your shop
open because you have to start making
[SPEAKER_01]: enough money to comply with the
regulations that are coming because now
[SPEAKER_01]: that Colorado has set the standard,
other places are just kind of adopting
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're just saying Colorado's doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of set it around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not making the same mistakes as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already have a template.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting what we used to call
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here was the wild, wild west that I talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse knows the wild wild west real well,
grow the quarter pounds in the houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: rent other houses, grow weed in there,
take that weed to shops and sell it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: shops straight up for cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd walk in with the back pack full of
pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a variety, if I had five or six
quarter pounds, I could sell all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter pounds for like 700, 750 a quarter
pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't walk out with cash back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a handful of shops here in town
and in the area that really, I guess only
[SPEAKER_03]: one of them survived, but, um,
uh, well too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, um, you know, that's,
they didn't have girl rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they, they got stuff from guys
like me and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was totally legal at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all, you know, medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't that what people just went
out and got their red cards and they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's, that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that kind of squeezed the gray
market here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it not like in town, just because it
was accessible inside city limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we made our dispensary public,
we had a dispensary that we kept slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: private.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't let a lot of people know about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in a little kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Private clubs are nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually we decided let's take this
to the big room in our retail store and
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of show that this is what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we drop prices in this town
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was 400 bucks an ounce for any kind
of kind, but for a while around here,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, about 10 years ago, 10 or 12 years
ago, 400 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sour diesel that we smoke 400 bucks
an ounce dude for 28 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: No love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you'd sell it for 60 bucks an eighth
and they'd be 3.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: No love on that bag at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got the shop going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we first did it, ounces were 350.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to keep us in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we were selling out, you know,
and then we had, we had a big outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest and we dropped down ounces down to
three 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our patients were paying two 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, we were seeing better
quality because a lot of our stuff was
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing a large outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the competitors, the two shops
that are still around, they were getting
[SPEAKER_01]: good indoor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't grow enough to keep it on our
shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a downtown location.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were banging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we dropped prices to 200 bucks an ounce
at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fucked up the whole town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting hate mail, hate calls,
death threats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people were mad at me because I was
the one, I was the face of that shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it was all me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we pissed off the town and drop
prices now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you score a good ounce in this town
for 200 bucks and people still want to
[SPEAKER_01]: find cheaper ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out there, but for the good dank,
it's about dispensary prices usually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending on where you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about four 15 ounce right now at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for a good day counts,
they got some good Durban poison though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, if I had to spend some money on
that, I would, I would probably get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I can go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned the part about Seth Rogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may not, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Rogen wanted to come to Denver and do
a smoke out for his new movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't let him smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the quick version.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smoke in a public place anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to serve tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of justice ruling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get, we'll get, we'll try to read
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will since you just said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian tribes can legalize pot on their
lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sub headline, if tribes can
balance all the potential social issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be a really huge opportunity,
says Seattle attorney Anthony Broadman,
[SPEAKER_01]: whose firm represents tribal governments
throughout the West.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this article was published on December
11th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written by Jeff Bernard and Gosea
Woznakia from the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the US Department of Justice said
Thursday that American Indian tribes can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and sell marijuana on their lands as
long as they follow the same federal
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions laid out for states that have
legalized the drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon US attorney Amanda Marshall said
Thursday, the announcement addresses
[SPEAKER_01]: questions raised by tribes about how
legalization of pot in states like Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, and Colorado would apply to
Indian lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only three tribes have expressed interest
in growing and selling marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: said Marshall, who co-chaired a group that
developed the policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is in California, one in Washington,
and one state in the Midwest that she did
[SPEAKER_01]: not name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the primary message tribes are
getting to us as US attorneys,
[SPEAKER_01]: Marshall said from Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will the US as federal partners do to
assist tribes in protecting our children
[SPEAKER_01]: and families, our tribal businesses,
our tribal housing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How will you help us combat marijuana
abuse in Indian country or Indian county
[SPEAKER_01]: when states are no longer there to partner
with us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana abuse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys see a lot of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of abuse just over here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you're just like fucking,
oh, that four grams of scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throw that in the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me laugh because I'm thinking
about what does get abused on Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: reservations I've been on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to ask you, how do you
feel about that too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they're allowed to do everything
that they're... Now they're making money
[SPEAKER_00]: in collecting tax for the state,
but all that land is tax free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've fucking stolen the whole West from
them, but if you're going to make money...
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to sell it to the
public as Indian grown herb, you should at
[SPEAKER_00]: least pay tax on the land that it's doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: For your plot, for your acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this really approaches that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the state would still require
tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely going to take taxes for
the herb, but not for the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't retax the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the whole problem with having
an Indian business on the free land though
[SPEAKER_00]: is that's the fight they've been fighting
for many years is they won't let them have
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of businesses on there that's
going to prove profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they open a casino or something like
that, it's not on Indian land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on some outskirt land that they've
had to buy separately and pay land tax on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been one of the large arguments
that I've at least seen over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about that to argue
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you win.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was asking you... Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving you credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Southern boy just made a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 44, hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, it sounds like we're razzing each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just are because we're bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get mad at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give him a fucking wedgie in
a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hard that you can read Hanes on his
forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever had that kind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pull it up right over your forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took your shoe in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You reach over here and look for underwear
and when you go find them it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really weird for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the episode
with too much information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to read this article with
the throw up that's in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marshall warned...
[SPEAKER_01]: The announcement is not a green light to
tribal authorities and that marijuana is
[SPEAKER_01]: still illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US government's prosecution priorities
involve pot related gang activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: violence, sales to kids and trafficking
will continue, she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problems could arise for tribes with lands
in states that still outlaw marijuana due
[SPEAKER_01]: to the likelihood that marijuana could be
transported or sold outside tribal
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries, she added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle attorney Anthony Broadman,
whose firm represents tribal governments
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the West, said the announcement
represents a potential for enormous
[SPEAKER_01]: economic development tool here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If tribes can balance all the potential
social issues, it could be a really huge
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'll be able to handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to read this one next paragraph and
then we can rant on the part that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those social issues are monumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian tribes have been decimated by drug
abuse, Broadman said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tribal regulations of pot are going to
have to dovetail with tribal values,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure marijuana isn't a scourge like
alcohol or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sound racist maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that natives have trouble with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them, but the ones that do
really fucking do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol is a horrible thing that ruins
tons of lives, not just Native Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that you concentrate them
in one area and then you look at them from
[SPEAKER_00]: afar and then you notice similarities and
stereotypes just as in any race or...
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is herb going to be a big problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a reservation that- We've
seen that it works here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington hasn't blown up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to replace the alcohol abuse on
the reservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you not look at Alaska almost in
that same way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Alaska's aren't Native American,
but I mean, a lot of the people up there-
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Alaska, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Colorado, all those tribes,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, really bad problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not to sound like a dick,
but I mean, I've been around a reservation
[SPEAKER_03]: or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd be an awesome development
thing for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Economical development for sure and
getting back to the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read about these taxes part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax part here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, tribes selling marijuana may not
be subject to state and local taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing them to undercut off-reservation
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington, taxes add 25% of the price
of pot, also in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Allison Holcomb, Holcomb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I said that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A primary drafter of Washington state's
legalization measure said most people in
[SPEAKER_01]: larger states won't want to drive to
far-flung reservations to buy pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, imagine that Indian dank weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it here on the podcast that we had the
statistic where we got $30 million just in
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational sales this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and 70% of that came from
out-of-staters.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% of that came from out-of-state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time I go in and talk to
the security guard at any dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, fucking taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you 50% of that was Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go kind of fast because we're
approaching an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Yakama Nation, I said that wrong,
Yakama Nation, sorry, I apologize,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Washington state recently passed a ban
on marijuana on the reservation and is
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to halt state regulated pot sales
and grows on lands off the reservation
[SPEAKER_01]: where it still holds hunting and fishing
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't want you growing where they
can hunt and fish, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if there's actually a conflict
with that or if it's just politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to find our botanic air
bottles and they're hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wonder if there's actually anyone
that wants to grow on their hunting
[SPEAKER_03]: grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually says the Hoopa Valley tribe in
Northern California has battled illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: pot plantations on its reservation where
they cause environmental damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, that's illegal at any rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 566 tribes around the country
recognized, I'm going to go fast and skim,
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized by federal government.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of consulting
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limited resources and a vast amount of
territory to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal prosecutors will not prosecute
minor cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tribal policy is based on the so-called
coal memo named after the deputy attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: general who wrote it in which Justice
Department said the federal government
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't intervene as long as legalization
states tightly regulate the drug and take
[SPEAKER_01]: steps to keep it from children,
criminal cartels and federal property.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all the memo said US attorneys reserved
the right to prosecute for eight issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: sales to kids, marijuana proceeds going to
criminal enterprises, shipping marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: to other states where it is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys quit doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal sales, firearms and violence,
drug driving and other health issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing marijuana on public lands and
possession of marijuana on federal
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully eventually they're going to
let the Indians, the natives, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: the natives will be able to grow on their
land and maybe have their own Indian
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they grow some dank, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're an agricultural people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would make the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there would maybe be ones that
would abuse it just like anywhere else,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, I bet they would be
real respectful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they not used that as ceremonial
herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they use, but I'm sure
if you gave it to them, it'd be the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the Rastas use for meditation
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that it was around,
but it'd be a more modern thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows wild in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get technical, the three of
us abuse cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we say we're medical patients,
that third dab we just took was way beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a medical patient for stress,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how abusive we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the problems we're causing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're loud mouths with microphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to take a nap on the couch the other
night because I took too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it had been whiskey or something like
that, we would have all fought each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have thrown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd have fucking trashed the neighbor's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go over an hour,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you can stick with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging in for the random
chatter episode, which might be what I
[SPEAKER_01]: name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Rogen, I've got two articles here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an article posted on December
8th, and then there was a follow-up
[SPEAKER_01]: article posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me click it to read the next date.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came out December 9th.
[SPEAKER_01]: The night of the 8th must have been the
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Rogen says he will.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Rogen says he will screen his new
film Monday night in a Denver movie
[SPEAKER_01]: theater filled with marijuana smoke and
hundreds of his fans, but will movie
[SPEAKER_01]: theater hotbox actually happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: While Rogen has said he thinks it should
happen, the city of Denver's executive
[SPEAKER_01]: director of marijuana policy thinks the
screening should obey Colorado law,
[SPEAKER_01]: sends the marijuana smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He planned on debuting his new movie at
the Oriental Theater, and he tweeted about
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, we're going to all get stoned in
the theater, and that was kind of a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that can't really happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the rules here in Colorado,
they are super strict about that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, Rogen started tweeting about
getting high inside the Colorado theater
[SPEAKER_01]: with his fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the host venue, the Sy Film Center on
East Colfax Avenue, contacted Sony to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them the audience couldn't light up inside
their spaces as it would be against
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Sony told the film center the evening
was no longer happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis reported that Rogen responded
via Twitter that a Colorado screening
[SPEAKER_01]: would still happen only at a different
theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old venue is acting lame, so we got a
new one, Rogen tweeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where will Rogen land tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, this is from a few nights
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oriental Theater owner, Scott Labrera,
who, dude, we've had some raging dab
[SPEAKER_01]: parties in the Oriental Theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the first Dabs of Denver
event was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the secret cup used to be held.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video on the iRegenetics YouTube
channel of me taking a fat dab inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the first dab in there,
as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started that party up with a big old
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then he says, tonight's venue is
private and closed to the general public,
[SPEAKER_01]: and two promoters who regularly booked the
North Denver Room for a pot friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy shows confirmed that Rogen's
screening is scheduled to happen there on
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's at the Oriental Theater,
owner of Denver Pot Shop, Denver Relief
[SPEAKER_01]: and comedy production group Sexpot Comedy
Told the Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if there will be any sort of
consumption or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to scroll through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was planning to come and watch this
new movie, which I still haven't read the
[SPEAKER_01]: name of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not advertised the name of his
movie in this article at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it the interview?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't watch TV, so I don't see the
commercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no provision in Amendment 64
for the on-premise consumption of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, Kilroy said, that could have
been put in Amendment 64, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the voters did not vote for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kilroy said the Denver Police
Department and the city's Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Excise and License have historically
contacted businesses advertising pot
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly parties ahead of time to talk
about potential violations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've educated people on what the law is,
said Kilroy, and we've gotten compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: When asked if they were aware of Rogen's
event and without even mentioning the
[SPEAKER_01]: Oriental as a possible location,
Kilroy's office told the Cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver Police would reach out to the
Oriental Theater's owners sometime Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the original article.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to come, he was going to
puff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the next publishing day,
the ninth, Jack Brown from the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: said, his article highline, no weed,
plenty of tequila at the interview in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver with Seth Rogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was one thing everyone could
smell Monday night at the Denver screening
[SPEAKER_01]: of the interview, tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to not puff and they had to serve
tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would happen if we replaced every dab
we've taken on the podcast and before the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast with a shot of tequila?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think our night would have
gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have probably pissed myself by now and
thrown up somewhere because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: tequila makes me do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have been really mad and
violent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you think you give me shit about
dabs, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even more of a pussy when it comes to
liquor beer I can deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have to be, not being able
to drink tequila does not mean you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy with my old lady pounds the
rest of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not bring her into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the article goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says when I ran into Rogen on the top
floor of the theater in Northwest Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was adamant that the show was not how
he imagined, how he had imagined the
[SPEAKER_01]: December 8th event, which had been hyped
by Rogen on social media as a 420 friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: affair.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city said they shut us down if there
was any smoking, he said with the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bottle of Juarez tequila in hand,
but I can't control what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Rogen couldn't, maybe,
but Rogen couldn't, but maybe the,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cadre?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cadder?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big ass group of secret service-esque
security personnel definitely enforced the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado clean indoor air rules,
asking several people in my section to
[SPEAKER_01]: leave during the screening for using vape
pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were also rumored to be a number of
undercover police officers in the crowd in
[SPEAKER_01]: case there was any smoking taking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, this is the shit that happened in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you're going to go somewhere and
puff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen at the Oriental
theater.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the places it does happen at,
we keep our mouth shut about because we
[SPEAKER_03]: like doing it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see pictures of people standing
around in circles and sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's just not something
that we take pictures of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're here and you're cool and we know
you and stuff, we'll grab you and take you
[SPEAKER_01]: to a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'll definitely come with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops don't go in the mountains here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't blow our dab spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found some really cool adventurous dab
spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the duo took stage, Rogan started
things off by saying, fuck the police,
[SPEAKER_01]: which elicited big cheers from the pro-pot
crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Audience questions range from actual
threats by North Korea over the film
[SPEAKER_01]: because Rogan having North Korea
threatened nuclear war is not ideal yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't even go into that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rogan made sure to correct a question
about smoking bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, first I smoked joints five to
seven a day, but on a night that was light
[SPEAKER_01]: on both joints and bowls, more were left
simply handing him various pot products
[SPEAKER_01]: for later.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the state that famously legalized it,
most of the weed smoking, so
[SPEAKER_01]: repetitiously, that's a good fucking word,
took place in a side alley next to the
[SPEAKER_01]: theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe next year, Rogan explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way things are trending with pot
consumption enforcement, perhaps next year
[SPEAKER_01]: looks even worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're really cracking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't puff here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be in a private house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want you at home smoking your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much the only place they want
you doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few hotels that advertise 420
friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our favorite hotel that we drive past that
we see that advertised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right outside of Manitou.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we head back from the Monte factor,
you see the 420 friendly sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've taken down the 420 friendly part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It no longer says that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably still 420 friendly,
but they probably had to just quit
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising such just to keep themselves
out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: The micro-tel here in Pueblo is 420
friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend that works over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, D, if you're listening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Big D and Little D.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we stayed there when we first got
over this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They only have a couple of rooms that are
actually 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say no, then there's measurements
to take, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's about time to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for an hour and seven
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope your ADD didn't kick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you made it through the whole show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to check out all of our
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, pretty soon we'll have King Kola
back on the show to talk more about
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of questions about MAP
and DAP for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, we're going to do an additives
lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you, since I have taken this new
job at the spot being the master grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do promise you that it will not deter or
detract from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still going to do our best to put
out kick-ass podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may actually help me do some hydro
lessons for you because everything we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing there is on large scale commercial
hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get to expand my hydro knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do lessons on additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I read that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: What to add to your shit during what week
so that you know when to boost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about basic news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we need to talk about additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working towards episode 50 also.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just be a recap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weren't we just celebrating 25?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, 25 weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have been listening for a long
time and you've got some favorite moments
[SPEAKER_01]: of the show or some highlights or
something in a highlight reel,
[SPEAKER_01]: message me and let me know when that was
and we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll kind of reminisce on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see who we can't get to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can set up like 22 microphones and
get everybody that's ever been on onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: show all at once or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just have another spot like you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we did at the break yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go try to find a public place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not going to be... Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give away something free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygro indoor growing supplies is going to
step it up and give away something.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you got... I got a t-shirt or a
hat pin or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stickers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got any shout outs or anything to
make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine was for you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bender, of course, he's keeping the
service running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Fisher, cut faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I feel bad for him now because he was
like, I don't want to listen to your voice
[SPEAKER_00]: last week and now he's going to have to
listen to both of our voices this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long can we go on and just sit here
and give away shit and just be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set him up at the microphone and just
walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a rapper?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish is a rapper and he's tired of hearing
your voice on a recording?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell him, do you have some sympathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me he expects everyone to listen to
him rapping the same shit over and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just likes to complain about
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he goes to work, he's like,
nevermind, I'm going to go say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a semi-family-friendly podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went almost full construction talk
on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a love-hate relationship they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: They love to piss each other the fuck
right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes work fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't kill each other at work,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Fish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know when you're performing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always... Dank Uno Gros.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uno, like Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did most of my shout outs at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 44, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting at home eating dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a podcast and I'm always down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was planning a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really had shit planned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't sound like it on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought him because at least
he had something going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's so damn cool that he messaged me
around six with podcast as his question
[SPEAKER_01]: mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, dude, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to bug him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to have him come over and just
going to let him do his night,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he wanted to, so I'm so glad he came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you listen all the way up to
episode number 50, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like Hygro is going to have some
sort of prizes for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking a light setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on shipping and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email me some of your favorite moments and
stuff, guys, which you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll reminisce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a lot of fun on number 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that'll be the one when I take a
half gram dab at the end of the show or a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram dab at the end of the show because I
need to retire this big ass dab phase
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been going on in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to kill me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we play fiddle music or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some violin, soft, instrumental shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monte music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, huge shout out to the Monte factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some loose leaf Monte in a bag to
take with me last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are super kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the next time I go there,
I may stray from the Monte.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may try a chai.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy that works there last time,
I was putting honey in my Monte and he
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me the, come here, and I went over
there and he's making himself a chai for
[SPEAKER_01]: him and he poured a little bit of it into
a little to-go cup for me and he goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the chai and he was just like,
get out of here, take this, love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on my way out and dude, it was the
dankness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may need to, what time is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much crack was in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there was much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got you hooked though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his own special kind of crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be looking at the clock because I'm
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call my girlfriend and see if
she wants to go to Monte with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have money right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not out of a milk jug or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually make their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they make everything there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make everything there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Monte factor in Manitou Springs,
you guys, it's my little secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go there, tell them, hey,
I heard about this place from the hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: culture podcast and they don't know who I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a flyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a flyer back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys all, I'm not going to edit
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it's going to go out to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no editing in the shows lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not cutting anything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go out just like it
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had to stop recording one time a couple of
shows ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jesse turned like olive green on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice construction worker red.
[SPEAKER_01]: My shout outs all go to Angela,
my tremor friends, Mike and Adam here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is Overgrow the Gov on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, yeah, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you pointed that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam's mic is off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put you back on, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels rude as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.

is over, but please do listen to this part
