[SPEAKER_00]: Take three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 463 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Downshift
Live Batter from Green.ly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Southbound and HSB,
which is the Han Solo burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, they describe the flavor
as gath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gath?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just say gath?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is the Mike Tyson podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Hot Boxing with Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flavor is described as gath,
earth, and hazelnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really says gas, earth, and hazelnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely taste the gas, the earth,
but the hazelnut eludes me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not catch the hazelnut flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, that one is missing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense, not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fucking tremendous and delicious
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this product
contains 67.99% THC and zero CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the flavor and aromas,
but mostly, I enjoy the excellent high
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Downshift Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs for always keeping me laced up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the delicious and tremendous top
shelf concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and jelly spoons,
in this episode, I am going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: a subject that Mike and I were discussing
on a recent car ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to give
a shout out to some of my friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big thank you shout
out to my friend Miss Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also send a big thank you shout out
to my buddy Richard M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna send a giant thank you and a Grow
From Your Heart podcast shout out to our
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big thank you shout out to Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast thank you and a shout out to Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant thank you to Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we can't miss our buddy Tanner
M.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
I wanna send a giant thank you shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to our buddy Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I said that I
was going to bring up a conversation that
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I had on a long adventurous car
ride yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to, where did I go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Frisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to Frisco, Colorado yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about a three and a half hour
drive each direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little bit of a traffic jam
and some construction one way,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it turned into a four and a half hour
drive one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: About three and a half hours on the way
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot complain at all because Mike was a
great co-pilot and a great passenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Mike, I said, hey bro,
I'm gonna go up to this place and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go buy some new drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up a new DW collector series drum
kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't talk too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said, Mike, I'm gonna go buy these
drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool to have a passenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any hesitation, he said,
what time do I need to be there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike came with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went for a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now anytime you put Mike and I in a car
together, there will be great
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: After being in the car on a nice country
ride for about an hour yesterday,
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided that it was time, maybe possibly
allegedly, to pull out my Green Dot Labs
[SPEAKER_00]: DAB pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I busted out my Green Dot pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the button five times to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flickered at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I held down the little button and I put it
in my mouth just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And allegedly, I took a nice little dab on
a back country road on a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started a lot of great conversations
between Mike and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, Mike was like, are you dabbing
while you're driving buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, maybe allegedly, but possibly
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the conversation that followed was,
what do you feel about the controversy
[SPEAKER_00]: around those pens Mike was a little bit
surprised to see me hitting a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about all of this
controversy and shit that is swirling
[SPEAKER_00]: around DAB pens and vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it is partly my responsibility
to address this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did invite Mike to come back,
but he spent all of his playtime yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: going on an adventure with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today he is being a good husband and a
good father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I am here by myself trying to
recreate the conversation and remember the
[SPEAKER_00]: main bullet points from our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently in the news, we have heard a lot
of controversy, a lot of cries of fear and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of warnings surrounding vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of this recording,
multiple people have died from vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of this recording,
multiple people are hospitalized from
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaping has caused mass hysteria on social
media and through the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it is the new scare in
America this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike was quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was quite surprised to see me just
sucking on this green dot vape cart pen
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was a pacifier and I was enjoying
it with no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike and I had a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several things to think about
when it comes to vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first questions I have when it
comes to vaping is, was the person injured
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming a cannabis vape, a cannabis
concentrate vape, or were they using a
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine vape?
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of these things are going to
have different outcomes and different
[SPEAKER_00]: risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to start by talking about
nicotine vapes and e-juice because
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, that is where I have the least
amount of knowledge and the least amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not a nicotine podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will cover this portion very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many obvious dangers behind
vaping nicotine e-juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, there are many obvious
dangers behind vaping anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are heating a material to a
temperature where it volatizes to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can inhale it as a vapor and you are
taking that product into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you're vaping, there has
got to be some sort of a health concern
[SPEAKER_00]: and a health risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what the doctors say,
how they say it's healthier, it's safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still some sort of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that is supposed to go into
your lungs is clean air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other elements in that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nitrogen, there's oxygen,
there's carbon dioxide, a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but we don't need to add
particulates and other things to that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what our lungs were designed
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am a big giant hypocrite because I
take half gram dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying we have to keep in mind
that vaporizing anything has an associated
[SPEAKER_00]: health risk and we have to keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're vaping the nicotine or the
nicotine-free e-juice, we have to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that we may not know where that came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep in mind that the companies
making these products are in business to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not a health company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not a wellness company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a profiteering company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, they are in another
country that does not have production
[SPEAKER_00]: standards that we have here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what you are vaping in those
e-juice pens?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple different products
being used to cut the nicotine juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have been proven to be safer
than others, but we haven't been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this long enough to have long-term
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what's going to happen to
people 20 years after vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what's going to happen to
people 20 years after vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the second thing I think about when
it comes to vaping anything is the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine, the device, the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are heating up something hot enough to
create your material to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are you heating up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you heating up the plastic,
the rubber, the polyurethane coating,
[SPEAKER_00]: the aluminum, the glass, the faux glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were heating up your e-juice or
your concentrate or your flour or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, to a temperature, to achieve
vaporization, you were probably possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: heating up other elements in your device
that you were inhaling directly into your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be consuming extra particles that
we do not want, that we did not agree to,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we did not even know we were sucking
in when we were sucking on these vape
[SPEAKER_00]: pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to e-juice, whether it is
nicotine-free or has nicotine,
[SPEAKER_00]: my main concern is what else is in that
juice?
[SPEAKER_00]: It only has to be a little bit of
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For it to be passed as nicotine vape
juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the other stuff in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that donkey piss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that propylene glycol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just random leftover shit in the
factory from something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a byproduct from something they're
making in that factory?
[SPEAKER_00]: These countries and these manufacturers do
not care about the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make a product, they want to
put it in a bottle, and they're sending it
[SPEAKER_00]: on a boat to another country for us to
consume, and they don't want to have any
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences or any fucks about what
happens to that product or to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to shift my way to talking
about cannabis and cannabis concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges and vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are consuming cannabis-based
vaporizers, whether it is consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a Pax or a Vapor Brothers or a
Volcano, or if you're smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate in a Green Dot pen,
however you are now consuming it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that product started off as a raw cannabis
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be grown as a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be produced into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to go through a processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a drying and curing,
probably a slight trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, if they choose to do so,
it is turned into a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different methods of
making concentrates, several different
[SPEAKER_00]: consistencies and varieties of
concentrates available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it is made into the appropriate
concentrate, then it is put into a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is the route that concentrate is
planned to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are many opportunities for
things to go wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about the beginning steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we can apply a plethora of terrible
pesticides and fungicides to our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be concentrated in the
concentrate that is produced from that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I have a grow room filled with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I dilute my pesticide properly and I
spray those plants with the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, eventually we have to cut those
plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take all of that dried material
and turn it into a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that pesticide that was diluted
across all of those plants also comes
[SPEAKER_00]: through in that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In concentrate making, it is common to
pool somewhere between 10 and 25% returns
[SPEAKER_00]: on your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I put in 100 grams, I should pull
somewhere between 10 and 25 grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate out of that vat when I am
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's think a little bit about how
much pesticide has been concentrated into
[SPEAKER_00]: my vat of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very possible to get very high
concentrations of undesirable pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: in your concentrates if you use pesticides
in the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even detect these pesticides if
the pesticides were applied late in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what pesticides are used,
what fungicides are used, or what molds
[SPEAKER_00]: and mildews were present in the plants or
in the grow room, or what yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria happened during the hanging and
drying and curing process, we have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of opportunity for a lot of shit to
already be going into our concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even gotten to the extraction
step of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got this possibly contaminated
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut all the leaves off of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to grind it up into a
little dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to run it through our
concentrate machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of machines you're
using in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got their own technique,
their technology, and their own equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many opportunities for
things to go wrong during the concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would hope that all concentrate
makers are responsible and care about the
[SPEAKER_00]: health and safety of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, many people are only out
for the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the opportunity for
potentially contaminated cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted in a dangerous and unsafe and
unprofessional manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can lead to many problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main problem being contaminants in the
finished product, whether it's mystery
[SPEAKER_00]: oils from the gases used or if it's
remaining residual hydrocarbons in the
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got a nice batch of
concentrate that has had many opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for potential problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have had pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have bugs in the starting flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have hazardous pesticides and
fungicides applied to the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have moldy flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have yeasty flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a lot of problems with the
starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we could have really fucked it up
even worse by running it through a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate machine and not properly
cleaning the machine, not properly
[SPEAKER_00]: distilling our gases, not properly purging
the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have created a lot more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have compounded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got a pesticide laden soup
that has not been purged properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are going to put that into a
concentrate pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cartridges for these concentrate pens
are readily available on several websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them by the 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them by the gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them thousands at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that brings me back to the safety of
these carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is making these carts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who oversees this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who goes to China and make sure that these
carts are not being made with the
[SPEAKER_00]: shittiest, lowest quality recycled metals,
crap, happiest plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know what's in any of these
cartridges?
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be the most dangerous things
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, when I hold down
this button, this battery heats this
[SPEAKER_00]: product inside of here to a temperature
where it turns it into a vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else am I heating up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I heating up shitty hot dog metal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I heating up cheap glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I heating up this fancy soft rubber
coating on the outside here and possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizing that at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of things to think
about when it comes to using a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is clean quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part is a clean quality
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have to think about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are putting the concentrates
into these cartridges, it has to be cut
[SPEAKER_00]: with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they using for the cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I choose, and this is not a
commercial, the reason I choose the Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs concentrate pens is because these
are made with nothing but live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not cut these at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not the cheapest pen on the
market, but they are the pen that I choose
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is no cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pure live resin and you can taste
it and you can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many companies out there use a cutting
agent to make their product work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be very careful about those
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my understanding,
several of the people who are sick or
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitalized at this time from using vape
pens used a vape that had vitamin E in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you heat up vitamin E,
it becomes vitamin E acetate, which I am
[SPEAKER_00]: not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to explain that,
but it is terrible for your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is catastrophic for your body and
wreaks havoc on your respiratory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these people consumed a product that is
not safe and they ended up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to pay attention to the
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we need to pay attention to
is the cart itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know as a consumer, it is hard to
know if that cartridge is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were buying your cartridges from
the black market, whoever is selling it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you is going to promise you and assure you
that that is the safest cartridge on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did all the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought the most expensive shit we could
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are safe, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise we also used the best
concentrate and the safest cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we also used the best flowers we could
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is going to tell you that
because everybody needs to make a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, most people care more about
making a dollar than they care about your
[SPEAKER_00]: health and your safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will sell you a product that puts
your health and safety at risk so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can pay the rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not worried about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worried about their family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to segue into talking about
safety and getting your pens safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, I know that my pens
are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought them from whoever in the hood,
but he goes somewhere and he buys a big
[SPEAKER_00]: box of this kind of pens and he brings
them to our town and he hustles them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same place that you buy these
cartridges, they sell the boxes that they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get all of the popular carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy their packaging off of a website
in bulk right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your favorite dispensary is selling,
I'm just looking around my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your favorite dispensary sells light
switch brand carts, I can probably get
[SPEAKER_00]: light switch brand carts packaging off of
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can put whatever I want into those
carts and I can sell them to you and you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you have got light switch brand vape
carts and you're going to smoke it with
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is very dangerous and very risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what you're smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, if they're going to bullshit
you and tell you that you have got an
[SPEAKER_00]: official light switch cart and they're
lying to you, they're also probably going
[SPEAKER_00]: to lie to you about the quality and safety
of those carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also going to lie to you about
the quality and safety of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to continue to lie to you
about the quality and the safety of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever product was used to cut that
concentrate to allow it to volatize in
[SPEAKER_00]: your dab pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to go to the store and
they're going to buy the actual product
[SPEAKER_00]: they told you that you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go on social media and smoke
that one and make their product look
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that is how this fucking
industry is working right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm all about the free market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am all about the gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that business is business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that the hustle is the
hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that in your location,
shit has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody needs to bring the carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody wants the carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a supply and demand sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to ruin anybody's black
market hustle, but I'm about to fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: your business just because this is how
it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we can get people to be honest and
quit selling shitty carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stop buying carts on the black
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only buy your carts from a dispensary that
you trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only get your THC or CBD cartridges from
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send your friend to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send your homie to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely do not buy them on social media
or through the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to a dispensary and get a cartridge for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grabbing a cart right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This package has a lab test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got a potency test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got a manufacturer date on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by the numbers on here where
the flowers were grown, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration was extracted, and where it
was packaged by the numbers on this
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that this is a Green Labs
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sold to me from this dispensary
that is on the sticker here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that the strain is five on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross of Copper Kim and Infinity
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to taste like gas and pine
and melons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a 0.5 milliliter concentrate
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the appropriate numbers on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, oh, and then when I pop this open,
it's also got a lab test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the flowers were tested for
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no illegal pesticide in this
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no pathogens in this garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no yeast and molds in this
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were tested before they were turned
into concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, as per new Colorado state law,
all concentrate must be tested for potency
[SPEAKER_00]: and residual pesticides before it is
allowed to be sold to any consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that the flowers were tested and
as a backup plan, I know that my
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate was tested before it was put
into this cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also trust my friends at Green Dot Labs
to get quality carts because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: industry leaders and I know where to find
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong with this
cartridge, I can find Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an email address on here or even
easier, I would drive to the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would say, hey, there's a problem
with this cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary would solve the problem for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a medical or a health issue,
they would contact Green Dot Labs directly
[SPEAKER_00]: and Green Dot would help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot isn't just some dude in the hood
with a fake name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where to go find Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot has an office with
representatives and managers and,
[SPEAKER_00]: best of all, lawyers and all of the proper
channels to support themselves if
[SPEAKER_00]: something does go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best part is they are so heavily
regulated and monitored that I can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: this pen with confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure nothing is going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the flowers were tested multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate was tested again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I trust Green Dot because they are a
reputable company and I know this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real Green Dot concentrate cartridge
because I bought this at my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I just shit all over the black
market for a minute, but until we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to be honest, we need to buy our
carts from reputable dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't think any of the health
concerns or problems right now are caused
[SPEAKER_00]: by store-bought legitimate vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to the best of my knowledge,
most of the problems have been from
[SPEAKER_00]: e-juice or nicotine vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit that I did not go read the news
before I came here to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this idea fresh in my head and
wanted to get it out while it was hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I did not do the proper research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way to avoid any of these problems
is to not vape random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody passes you something and you
are not certain where it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to skip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a nicotine vape, whether it's
a cannabis vape, whether it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate pen, now is the time to start
being a little conceited and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: discerning about the products that we do
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that there are some areas
of our great country where you cannot go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dispensary and grab yourself a
reliable Green Dot Labs pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we can get everybody to be honest
and start thinking about our health and
[SPEAKER_00]: our safety and stop worrying so much about
their wallets, we need to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more discerning about where we spend our
money and what we put into our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not have another opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those carts and pens may be the thing that
comes around in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really worth risking my lung health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really worth risking my future,
my entire body health?
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get one body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only got two lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you fuck those up, that might be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to get high that bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another part of this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every shitty dealer out there selling
what we're calling a boof cart,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is another guy out there who's
going, man, I wish I could find a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't even care that it is going
to put their health at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't be the guy buying a shitty
cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be the guy supporting the shitty
cart sales people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate yourself and if you can,
educate your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, when it comes to health and
safety and consumption of products that
[SPEAKER_00]: make us feel a certain way, most people
don't give a shit about education.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do what they like to do,
what makes them feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want instant gratification as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it makes me feel good now, but kills me
in 10 years, I might be okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how we are as people,
some of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best I can say is educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I taught you something here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate your friends if they will listen
and be very careful about the products
[SPEAKER_00]: which you consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a fiend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to smoke, but I pass on plenty of
shitty looking concentrates and I rarely
[SPEAKER_00]: hit anybody else's pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this was not meant to be a Green
Dot Labs concentrate or a pen commercial,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are the product that I trust
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they are putting pure live
resin into these pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have experienced zero adverse side
effects from this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, that is my rant on
[SPEAKER_00]: vape pens and vape carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be safe out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please use your best judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please trust wherever your concentrates
and your concentrate pens are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear about any of you in
the hospital from a terrible concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: pen experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be good to one another.
