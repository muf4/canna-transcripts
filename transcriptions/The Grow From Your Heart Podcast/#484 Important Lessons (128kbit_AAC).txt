[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like to start this podcast
off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Chrome
Bread Live Batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Triangle Kush and The
White.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
petrol, fresh coffee and pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have just labeled this as
fucking dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is potent concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't tell by my voice,
if you can't tell by my slow delivery,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am freaking stoned as shit from this
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says that
this product contains 64.33% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really enjoy the stoned buzz I
got from the Chrome Bread Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read an
email from a friend that talks about grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room safety.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right ladies and gentlemen I did say
that I got an email asking about grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: safety so let's jump right into that the
email goes a lot like this it says yo
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff my name is Travis and you can
feel free to use my name hey thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes that really easy thank you for
the great email Travis it says I'm here in
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition land after being in Colorado
for 13 years I'm not growing here again
[SPEAKER_00]: until I see a change in these knuckleheads
minds about the devil's lettuce so we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a friend named Travis who was in
Colorado and he has moved down to
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in prohibition land and he
doesn't want to grow until those
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckleheads in prohibition land change
their mind about the devil's lettuce so he
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on to say I would like you to talk
about safety in small grows closets and
[SPEAKER_00]: tents in the same house in which you live
can you talk about electricity and fire
[SPEAKER_00]: safety and etc can you tell me if those
automatic fire extinguishers work thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for keeping me motivated to fight the
fight then they throw up three hang loose
[SPEAKER_00]: emojis and three big tree emojis it's a
big shout out to our friend Travis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great email that is a great topic let's
talk a little bit about safety in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room one of my biggest fears when people
are setting up a grow room is fire safety
[SPEAKER_00]: please do not be that person on the block
that burns down your house because of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room so that is a great place to
start this person actually asked about
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity and fire
[SPEAKER_00]: I should investigate how old that wiring
is I should do some investigation before I
[SPEAKER_00]: go plugging a high voltage high wattage
device into that outlet and risking an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical fire in my home I don't care if
it's a rental home I don't care if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: trap house I don't care if it's a home
you're buying we need to respect the home
[SPEAKER_00]: because we also need to respect the
neighbors and again don't be that asshole
[SPEAKER_00]: burning down the house because you were
trying to grow cannabis that does not look
[SPEAKER_00]: good for the cannabis movement in any way
so before you try to plug in a grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: simply go find the breaker box where the
breakers are that control the power in
[SPEAKER_00]: your house is that breaker box capable of
handling the amount of power you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: run from it then are the individual
breakers you plan to use capable of giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you the amount of power you want to pull
is the wiring capable of handling the load
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to pass through those wires these
lights are going to be on for some people
[SPEAKER_00]: run them for 24 hours a day some lighting
some will run them for 20 hours a day many
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to run their lights on
for 18 hours a day at minimum we are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be running high powered lighting for 12
hours a day that gives us a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to heat up those wires the
receptacles the plugins every bit of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get hot do not start a fire so
the first thing we need to think about is
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical capabilities can we handle the
load we are trying to pull you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably pull one light per breaker then
you can add a fan to it maybe a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers once you add more than that you
may risk flipping the breakers if the
[SPEAKER_00]: breaker flips more than once or twice that
is a sign don't be the guy that just keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping the breaker off and on you are
overheating that breaker the wiring the
[SPEAKER_00]: breaker everything is getting weaker as
you do that you are risking a fire every
[SPEAKER_00]: time you reset that breaker so if you do
realize you need electrical upgrades it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time to call a professional do not please
do not attempt to add electrical upgrades
[SPEAKER_00]: to your house unless you are a qualified
professional electrician you can cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more problems than you can do good by
messing with this much electricity and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kill yourself so please be very
careful playing with electricity even when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have an electrical professional add
upgrades to your grow you still cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: overload your outlets don't try to plug
more shit in than it can handle know how
[SPEAKER_00]: many amps each receptacle can handle know
how many amps you are pulling from each
[SPEAKER_00]: device and plan accordingly don't overload
your shit if you are not able to run your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow smoothly without the TV going off in
one room or when you turn on the toaster
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn off a piece of equipment you have
got problems that is too much pull you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to make adjustments I also do not
like extension cords in the grow I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like extension cords are weak do not plug
a light into an extension cord do not plug
[SPEAKER_00]: an air conditioner into an extension cord
that is your weak link in your chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity and that is the part that is
going to melt first and is going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: a fire hazard I do not like extension
cords if you insist on using an extension
[SPEAKER_00]: cord get an extension cord that is
overrated for the job I would rather have
[SPEAKER_00]: too heavy of a cord than too light of a
cord pick up one of those extension cords
[SPEAKER_00]: one day those orange cords if you're
running a thousand watt light through it
[SPEAKER_00]: pick that bitch up and feel how warm it is
how long do you think that's gonna last
[SPEAKER_00]: before something catches on fire so I feel
like I've stressed that enough do not
[SPEAKER_00]: overload your electrical outlets do not
overload your breaker box do not overload
[SPEAKER_00]: your wiring do not try to pull too many
amps through your house you will risk
[SPEAKER_00]: starting a fire if you insist on having
upgrades have it done by a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: you still cannot overload those breakers I
try to avoid extension cords when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing wiring think of this electrical goes
high water goes low I always try to have
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of electrical receptacles three
feet or higher off the ground if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: adding aftermarket receptacles to any sort
of area why not put them up higher most of
[SPEAKER_00]: your fans most of your lights all of your
shit goes up high water is down low
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical up high this way when you spill
some shit because you will spill some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: the water goes down there you don't care
get it on the electrical sockets you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got three feet if you've got three feet of
water in your room you've got bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking problems than electricity to worry
about at this point so water down low
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity up high let's talk about fire
I really like to have a smoke alarm in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow but I live in a legal grow state I
can have plants here if I do have a fire I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to get as early of a warning as
possible I do have a fire extinguisher on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside of my grow it is on the
outside of the grow room door don't put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there because if you have a fire in
there you got to go get the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher and then you're already in
the fire I would rather kick open the door
[SPEAKER_00]: and start spraying that bad motherfucker
so I've got some I'm just gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying and praying like I'm the fucking
FBI and the DEA coming in so I'd rather
[SPEAKER_00]: have that fire extinguisher on the outside
of the room I like the fire alarm in my
[SPEAKER_00]: situation because I am in a legal
environment again if I've got a fire I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to put it out and I would also
like to call for backup to come help me
[SPEAKER_00]: get that out to save the house if you were
in an illegal state you may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: rethink the idea of an alarm you may be
snitching on yourself but that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to gamble do you want to risk a
fire to where you've got to call the
[SPEAKER_00]: police and rescue the house or do you just
want to let that shit burn and stay out of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble you've got some thinking to do in
that situation in a legal environment I
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend some sort of fire alarm
smoke detectors and I absolutely recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: a fire extinguisher outside of the grow
get a bigger fire extinguisher than you
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect you will use and there's nothing
wrong with learning how to use it before
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a fire go out in the backyard go
somewhere safe pull the pin on that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: set up a target and spray the fire
extinguisher at something just to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's gonna feel like it's gonna have
a little kick to it it's gonna be heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: also when the time comes if there is a
fire and I don't want this to happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody but I would rather you be prepared
and have the shit you need instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: watch a fire and sit there and shit your
pants so when the fire does happen you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be scared you're gonna be shaky
you're gonna go into autopilot all this
[SPEAKER_00]: adrenaline is gonna kick in it's gonna be
fight or flight you may need to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: autopilot and remember how to work that
fire extinguisher just on fucking pure
[SPEAKER_00]: memory so learn how to use it now so that
when the time comes you are a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: now another thing this listener asked
about was the auto fire extinguishers they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell devices for grow rooms that hang
above the lights and if it reaches a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: point in that room this thing explodes and
releases a dusty powder that is non-toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: and it releases that all over the grow
room and that essentially suffocates the
[SPEAKER_00]: fire I've never seen them in action but I
have heard stories that those things
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely work and if you're not there
and you're not able to get to that fire
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately that thing will react for you
unfortunately the stuff inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: fire extinguisher will basically ruin your
crop so you've got to clean up the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room and start fresh but you probably
would have had worse results if that fire
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't put out so early so those things
that hang above the grow room it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like just a big red school bell is kind of
what it looks like and it's got a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor on it and if it gets to a certain
temperature it basically explodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases a dust and that dust smothers the
fire and you don't have a fire in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore so from what I've seen what I have
read those products do work and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: worth the money so the next note that I've
got is the word heat the equipment we are
[SPEAKER_00]: running in our grows has the potential to
create a lot of heat the grow lights will
[SPEAKER_00]: get very hot if you are running some sort
of hydro equipment your pumps can get very
[SPEAKER_00]: hot a lot of air pumps can get very hot
the air conditioner puts out a lot of warm
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust heat if you've got one of those
air conditioners that's on wheels with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting those ducts can get very hot I
recommend you wrap those ducts in some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of heater insulation to keep that
heat from getting back into the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: it keeps it right into that tube all the
way out of the wherever you're growing but
[SPEAKER_00]: we are creating a lot of heat when you are
building your space when you are placing
[SPEAKER_00]: your equipment it is very important that
you are very mindful of all of the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: let's not melt anything let's not burn
anything let's not cause any permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to whatever structure we decided to
grow in you probably have to move out of
[SPEAKER_00]: here let's do the best we can to get our
security deposit back so please be very
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of the heat you are creating also
be very mindful of the humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and damage with the water you are
doing to your grow area you may not think
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little bit of water causes a big
problem to a home but if you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: water in some of the structural parts of
the home you can cause catastrophic damage
[SPEAKER_00]: so be mindful of your heat and be mindful
of your water and moisture damage which
[SPEAKER_00]: you are doing to the home if you've got
too much humidity in the same room you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start creating mold if you've got too much
water on the floor you can start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: water underneath the walls you can get
water in the framework of the house it can
[SPEAKER_00]: get disastrous quite quickly houses have
to be condemned and rebuilt because of
[SPEAKER_00]: grows that have destroyed the homes so
please be very careful with that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff be respectful if you are renting a
home if you own the home be extra
[SPEAKER_00]: respectful because that's your shit you're
paying for it you work super hard take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of things so be mindful of heat be
mindful of water be mindful of drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: let's not start a fire and let's not flood
anything now i'm going to start working my
[SPEAKER_00]: way into basically personal safety things
what is something that drives me crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: that i see in a grow quite often is eye
safety people don't wear protective
[SPEAKER_00]: eyewear in a grow room that is filled with
stakes if you're using bamboo sticks or
[SPEAKER_00]: those green sticks to support your plants
in a grow room i strongly recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: get some eye protection i really don't
recommend stakes in a grow room unless
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your only option if you're running
two or three plants and you only need a
[SPEAKER_00]: few sticks that's okay but they are very
dangerous for eye pokes imagine you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a stick poking up out of the plant you
want to reach into that plant do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation you don't even see that stick
if you're looking straight at it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so thin you just lean right into it
and it goes right into your eyeball and
[SPEAKER_00]: what else do you get in your eyeball
probably some trichomes but also you get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that has been spray applied to
those plants directly into your eyeball so
[SPEAKER_00]: not only do you got a little poke you also
got some whatever some evergreen
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides maybe you sprayed some push on
there so you got a bunch of funk in your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeball that's just going to burn you're
risking an infection you're risking
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent damage so let's be more safe and
more careful and more mindful of eye
[SPEAKER_00]: protection in the grow environment there
are stakes in there there are sprays that
[SPEAKER_00]: are happening in there we can definitely
damage our eyes i highly recommend some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of method seven or similar protective
eyewear if you were around high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge lighting for a continued period
of time we need some sort of glasses that
[SPEAKER_00]: will protect our eyes from
[SPEAKER_00]: that high intensity lighting and that
ridiculous spectrum i have to stand there
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of minutes and let my eyes
adjust before i can even get to the car
[SPEAKER_00]: because i don't want to drive with that
weird eye fucked up spectrum i feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: my eyes are literally sunburnt from being
in there all day so make sure you wear
[SPEAKER_00]: good glasses when you're in the grow as
i'm getting older i am noticing more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the damage that the grow lights have done
i'm starting to notice that my night
[SPEAKER_00]: driving is affected by the damage from the
grow lights so please take care of your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes i have a good friend named jamie who
taught me years ago he said your eyes are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most vulnerable parts of your body
which are exposed to the elements and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're also one of the things you use the
most so he taught me to take good care of
[SPEAKER_00]: my eyes i wish i would have listened
better when i was a kid but again i was a
[SPEAKER_00]: kid so take care of your eyes in the grow
room please take care of your eyes around
[SPEAKER_00]: the stakes those stakes are dangerous
absolutely wear protective eyewear when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were applying pesticides and also i
recommend some sort of eyewear for the
[SPEAKER_00]: light spectrum which you are exposing
yourself to for hours on end every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day it may sound crazy but i also
recommend that you wear protective eyewear
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were mixing nutrients or
pesticides not only when you spray but
[SPEAKER_00]: when you are mixing i recommend you put on
gloves and protective eyewear before you
[SPEAKER_00]: reach into the nutrient cupboard to pull
nutrients out before you reach into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cabinet to get a pesticide put on your
gloves and protective eyewear quite often
[SPEAKER_00]: we work with other people or sometimes we
are stoned and lazy and forgetful
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves and maybe we don't screw the lid
on a bottle completely sometimes you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up a bottle and that lid's not all
the way on and maybe you'll give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: shake and now you've got pesticide all
over you maybe now you've got a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: all over you but luckily you were wearing
gloves and you were wearing eyewear so now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not blind and you're going to live
through it all you got to do is take a
[SPEAKER_00]: shower and change clothes or sometimes
maybe you've got a five gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_00]: water mixed up and you pour your container
with nutrients into your little measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: device and then you go to pour your 40
mils of liquid karma into your five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket and as it hits the water it
splashes and you're watching it go into
[SPEAKER_00]: there so it splashes directly into your
eye now you've got nutrient mix nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution in your eyeball you got recharge
you got liquid karma in there you got some
[SPEAKER_00]: base news you got cal mag in your eyeball
that can't be good for you no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it you got in there it's not
supposed to be there if you were wearing
[SPEAKER_00]: some protective eyewear guess what that
shit would not have happened so i
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend protective eyewear during the
mixing and anytime you're grabbing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle you should have some eyewear you
should have some gloves i know that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive but once you get some shit in
your eye you'll go oh i could have
[SPEAKER_00]: prevented this and that's absolutely
correct so eyewear eye protection gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment at all times
i highly recommend eyewear gloves and
[SPEAKER_00]: proper shoes i know i'm a big old hippie
too i love to run around barefoot but
[SPEAKER_00]: please wear shoes in your grow environment
for the first reason is because i just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want you to fuck up your fancy
little toes you don't want to break your
[SPEAKER_00]: toes while you're working you want the
grow room to be enjoyable don't bust a toe
[SPEAKER_00]: on something the second reason what if you
drop some scissors on there what if you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop something sharp on your little
toesies that's not gonna be fun my next
[SPEAKER_00]: reason is we apply pesticides in our grow
rooms those pesticides land on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't stop it they're going to get on
the floor that's the bottom that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to go eventually then you're
going to walk around barefoot the bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of your feet are one of the most sensitive
and most vulnerable spots for pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption so if you want to spray a
pesticide into someone's body their feet
[SPEAKER_00]: their armpits and their genitals are the
most easily absorbable spots for something
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into your body so don't walk around
in the grow room barefoot because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically working like a mop you're
walking around there picking up any
[SPEAKER_00]: spilled nutrients and any dropped
pesticides with your feet and absorbing it
[SPEAKER_00]: into your body so please wear proper
footwear in the grow room wear something
[SPEAKER_00]: that will cover your toes and keep you
protected now I shouldn't have to say this
[SPEAKER_00]: but you stoners need to be careful with
scissors I see so many trimmers cut
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves I see so many experienced
professional growers going way too fast
[SPEAKER_00]: and cutting themselves by doing stupid
shit I know we are in a hurry we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work to do but slow down safety
first if you cut yourself you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: even slower for the rest of the day and
I've got to take you to the hospital to
[SPEAKER_00]: get stitches and I've got to fill out a
goddamn incident report so please be more
[SPEAKER_00]: careful with your knives and your scissors
I understand we're in a hurry don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: cut dude and that goes for any tool we are
using in the grow room and any equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: we are using in the grow room understand
and respect what you're using I see some
[SPEAKER_00]: people say I know how to do that and they
pick up a piece of gear and I go bro you
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously don't know how to do that quit
trying to be Superman let's take a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: and properly train you before you hurt
yourself and the other people in this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: so understand and respect any tools and
equipment that you are using keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a grow room there are a lot of
moving parts we've got blowers we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: fans and we've got air conditioners we've
got a lot of operating parts I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of grill you were operating I
don't know where you are I know there are
[SPEAKER_00]: moving parts in many grows keep your
fingers and your hands out of any
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous spaces that should be obvious
but a lot of people seem to forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit we get stoned before we go to
work we like to smoke down before we go in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room then we put on good music
and we're working with good friends or
[SPEAKER_00]: we're by ourselves maybe you got Joe Rogan
talking to you in your ear maybe I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: yapping in your ear right now and you're
not paying a hundred percent attention
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget that there are a lot of
moving parts and there's a lot of sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: and dangerous shit happening in the grow
environment if you have got long hair or
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks or something like that keep
that shit tucked away from the fans keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit tucked away from the blowers
also if you're working with any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: trim machines or auto trimmers tuck your
hair and your dreadlocks up and also keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your fingers safe maybe don't smoke that
extra joint on your lunch break if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be the one running the trim machine
take care of yourself and be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: something I see cause a lot of problems in
grow rooms is lanyards those lanyards that
[SPEAKER_00]: are hanging out of our pockets with our
keys on them they get hung up on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything if it's not a plant it's a grow
table it's a hydro table it's a steak you
[SPEAKER_00]: get caught up on a valve switch you get
caught up on a shelf put those lanyards in
[SPEAKER_00]: your pocket or in your locker don't have
that shit dangling out in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: they are only problems that's just like
having another dreadlock hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: here's another random piece of grow room
safety and this is actually a rule from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado marijuana enforcement
division that I agree with we think a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of rules are stupid this one makes a lot
of sense if you're going to wear a lanyard
[SPEAKER_00]: around your neck in a grow environment a
lot of growers right now they work in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado have a lanyard around their neck
with their badge on it you've got to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: the badge to be in the building there are
only a few ways to affix that to your body
[SPEAKER_00]: that is acceptable by the MED so it's got
to be above the waist why not put it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lanyard that is a great spot if you're
wearing a lanyard around your neck it must
[SPEAKER_00]: be what is known as a breakaway lanyard if
I put enough pressure on that it should
[SPEAKER_00]: come undone and pop off your body so that
it doesn't twist up around your neck and
[SPEAKER_00]: choke you the reason for that is there are
fans in the grow room imagine if your
[SPEAKER_00]: lanyard got cut up in a fan you're the
only one there the fan spins the lanyard
[SPEAKER_00]: twists it chokes the fuck out of you and
you just got killed by a fucking fan in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room how stupid do you look right now
don't be that guy don't be that girl don't
[SPEAKER_00]: be that person also if you're using a
piece of trim equipment like the trim
[SPEAKER_00]: reaper or a hurricane or something imagine
if your lanyard gets stuck in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not breakaway it's fucking sucking
you in it's gonna put your face into that
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer no good we're going to the
hospital incident report and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a nose so please wear a breakaway
lanyard and be careful be mindful and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what you were doing in the
grow when you're turning around where's
[SPEAKER_00]: your elbow going as you spin around think
about when you squat down where does your
[SPEAKER_00]: ass go think about when you lean forward
what am I gonna put my eye into pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention I know it's a good time to be in
the grow room I know it's really relaxing
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we like to get blazed and put on
good music you probably have me or the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude grows in your ear you probably got
Joe Rogan or somebody like that but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit of grow room focus just
to prevent and avoid injuries another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I've got written down is the word
finger and foot smashes I like to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial environment with multiple
people I've usually got four or five dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: working in multiple rooms and we all need
to communicate in many of the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities which I operate we've got
tables that slide back and forth about 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inches and that way we can push the tables
together to one side of the room at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day and then if we need to work
on them we can spread them apart and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make rows and we can walk between them
in most of these rooms I can only make one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two rows so I'll be like hey bro I'm
gonna push these tables and we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear okay okay from every everybody else
in the room before you move it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need a guy between two tables at the
other end of the room getting squished I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need a guy getting his finger
smashed stuff like that is very dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: in a large-scale cultivation facility with
multiple people you have to communicate if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're moving something heavy if you're
carrying something heavy ask for help
[SPEAKER_00]: clear a path that is my next note here is
clean things up if you've got a clean grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment you've got less shit to
stumble and trip and fall over and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also just good practices to have a clean
tidy grow room then in that grow room I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you should also have a standard
first aid kit and some sort of cleanup
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff if you spill something do you have
some paper towels do you have a towel do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have basic first aid shit around can
you clean out a boo-boo can you wrap a
[SPEAKER_00]: bandaid up on it you have some gauze and
tape you have all that basic shit
[SPEAKER_00]: available somewhere in your home somewhere
near your grow space the next thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: think about is if you do get hurt who are
you going to call I'm in Colorado I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna call 911 if I need it because it's
legal here if you're not in Colorado if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in an illegal state you may need to
have a friend on speed dial it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: better to be able to call a friend instead
of calling an ambulance or calling law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement if you've got some sort of
minor injury that one of your friends can
[SPEAKER_00]: help you with of course if you've got
something serious you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the decision you may have to call for
help I hope it never comes to that
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you've got a friend maybe you
got a girlfriend or a wife or maybe your
[SPEAKER_00]: mama lives by you or something like that
but hopefully you don't ever have to call
[SPEAKER_00]: for help that's just a worst-case scenario
I've only got a couple of more bullet
[SPEAKER_00]: points to cover the next two things that
I've got written down are the words PL or
[SPEAKER_00]: other monitors I would recommend you have
something like a PL minder unit or another
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a monitoring device in your grow
that will let you know if temperatures get
[SPEAKER_00]: too high if humidity gets too high
something in the grow that will indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: you via an email via text message and give
you a live real-time update of what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in that grow if my grow room
gets too hot right now my PL grow minder
[SPEAKER_00]: unit will send an email to my phone my
phone will alert me I'll open up that
[SPEAKER_00]: email and it will say hey right now your
grow room is way too hot and I'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to the grow room and I'll say oh
it's too hot because of this and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: make corrections another thing I really
find helpful to keep my grow safe is a
[SPEAKER_00]: camera system I like to have a security
system on the house anyway that just seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be standard in this day and age but
also why not put a camera in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that camera won't be able to see heat or
humidity but you've got a PL minder unit
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you that stuff the camera will let
you visually see if those plants are too
[SPEAKER_00]: dry the camera will let you see if
something is tipped over the camera will
[SPEAKER_00]: really help you out in more ways than you
can even think of until the time comes
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll go oh I'm so glad that camera was
there so I really like having some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a real-time monitoring device that I can
access remotely I also enjoy having a
[SPEAKER_00]: camera which again I can access remotely
and see a real-time video then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: things to think about when it comes to
safety are cops and robbers if you live in
[SPEAKER_00]: a legal state you don't have to worry too
much about cops but if you live in an
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal state you need to be prepared on
how you are going to act and how you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to respond if they do show up at
your front door knock knock knock who is
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's the police your heart drops you
shit your pants a little bit you pee a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of drops you take that big swallow
you go and then you go you open the door
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go can I help you and they go yeah
we're either here because like something
[SPEAKER_00]: down the street happened we want to ask
you questions the answer that is I ain't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen shit and you close the door or
they're gonna go hey we urge you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow here you're gonna have to figure out
what you're gonna say think about that now
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have an answer again when the
time comes you're gonna shit your pants a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of drops of pee are gonna come out
your palms are gonna get sweaty the cops
[SPEAKER_00]: are at your front door it's time to go
it's always better to have a prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: answer than try to think of shit right
then so know what you're going to say most
[SPEAKER_00]: of that conversation should end with come
back when you've got a warrant but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the particular situation but you
should
[SPEAKER_00]: be prepared the next thing to think about
is robbers I don't know the kind of people
[SPEAKER_00]: around you and I don't know the kind of
risks that you are running but these are
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you need to think about cops
and robbers are always a thing when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to cannabis production whether it is
illegal or illegal environment I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing to think about when
it comes to safety in a grow room whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it be a personal production area or a
large-scale commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is pay attention I keep saying
that I know we like to smoke when we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: but be aware maybe don't smoke that third
dab before you go to work maybe don't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that fifth joint maybe put that
blunt out three-quarters of the way before
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to work so you don't cut yourself
so you don't cause a problem also so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't mix up those nutrients wrong if you
can handle your smoke you do your thing if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't you dial it back but the main
thing is that we be mindful and we pay
[SPEAKER_00]: very close attention to what we are doing
in our grows so that we don't hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves or others and so that we don't
cause problems to the grow by making
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid mistakes ladies and gentlemen boys
and girls pimps and hoes smokers and
[SPEAKER_00]: growers I really had a lot of fun
