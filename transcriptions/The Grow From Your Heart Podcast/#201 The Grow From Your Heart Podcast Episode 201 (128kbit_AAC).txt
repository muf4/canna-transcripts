[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 201 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me use their music on
my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a shout out to the new
member of the Mystic Roots family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Little Lake, Little Lake
Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cute little kid you guys got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, Kat and Ku.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The baby looks super healthy and is super
adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that kid was going to be cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize if you
can hear it in my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of a little bit of a
sniffle, a little bit of a sore throat
[SPEAKER_00]: thing happening, a sinus thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might just be a little bit dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have taken too many dabs over the
420 celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have overindulged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have dehydrated myself and not drank
enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my message to you is drink some water
and take some vitamins because I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell I could feel it on my
chest and throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if my throat and my voice
sound like shit on this podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, this is the post 420
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a good 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody stayed safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody did anything stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope nobody got themselves in any sort of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you did for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me at GFYHpodcast or you can send me
an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you did for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a correction to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying that this podcast has
been going for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of people have informed me that
they think the podcast has been going for
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend Bag Seed Jesse and
of course, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both pointed out that the show has
been going for approximately three years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even more proud than I was when I
thought it was two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 365 days more proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening to 201
episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting out those old episodes
of what used to be the iGrowCulture
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, and I hope you guys are enjoying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do one for the 420 week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put out a 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of took a little break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys missed those long
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to get one out for you
this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get done with this episode,
I will put it together for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already feel my voice burning out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may be a short episode,
you guys, but I promise I'll do the best I
[SPEAKER_00]: can with what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to apologize that my website looks
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of every episode, or actually,
when I tweet the episodes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: when a new episode comes out, I like to
send it out on Twitter and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, look, there's a new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to say, hey, you can check
out the podcast on iTunes, on Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also my website, iregeneticscolorado
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to iregeneticscolorado.com the
other day and I realized it looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of shit website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs some updating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: My web guy has been distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really put much effort or
energy into that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get fixed eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm acknowledging that it needs love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also admitting that it looks like
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't judge me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you guys are going to go there and
fucking look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have got a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to do the comments first or do
we want to talk about replies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about these replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I asked what you guys
were smoking for $420.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Big John said he was smoking
Chernobyl crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chernobyl is a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the slimer cut of
Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Big John is smoking Chernobyl crumble
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking that through a rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking it on top of flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how you're doing that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Big John.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope those shirts look good on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my friend Astro Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I was supposed to find a
screenshot from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a screenshot here on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's search through the phone real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find the screenshot really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the iPhone has a thing that says
screenshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a message from Astro Hayes that I
want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of messages I have to go
through super quickly here to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm kind of fucking up this part of
the podcast, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to hit pause or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very unprofessional feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is this Astro Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suck at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I apologize for that long shitty
moment of silence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had so much stuff in my phone,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Astro Hayes, he sent me a
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, man, love listening to the
last podcast, which I just started
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always love to know what people are
digging on when smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, I was a wrestler and used
to listen to a lot of Metallica,
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron Maiden, Rush, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before getting into the dead, I've seen
them over 60 plus times with Garcia all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still listen, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a daily ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also love Panic and Mo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually be out in Denver for the
three panic shows in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace and have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Hayes from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Astro Hayes, we do have a lot of musical
taste in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the dead over 60 times with
Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I salute you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it, I never got to see
Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many incarnations of the
Grateful Dead, but I never got to see
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerry play on a stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Orr spit on me during Throwing Stones
at a show at the Paramount Theater one
[SPEAKER_00]: year, the day before Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what year it was, like 96 maybe
ish, maybe 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long freaking time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rat Dog did a couple nights at the
Paramount Theater in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did Halloween and I went to the night
before Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the night that the spit landed on
my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking awesome, but never saw
Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're coming to see Panic this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'll go see Panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not huge into Panic like I used to be
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without Mikey and with all the changes,
I lost interest in Panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw widespread panic when Michael Houser
was still in the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shook Michael Houser's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Panic tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the tour when Michael quit,
actually, when he resigned and stepped
[SPEAKER_00]: down and let George McConnell take over
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on tour with Panic at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see a lot of Panic shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Mikey's last show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to the Red Rock shows right
after Michael Houser passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a huge Panic fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of lost interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moe is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moe is always going to be one of my
favorite bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm on a road trip, if I'm driving and
I'm getting tired and I need to wake up,
[SPEAKER_00]: put on some Moe, Plane Crash, 32 Things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in that realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Rebubbula, some Buster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that old school Moe stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tin cans and car tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even older stuff than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen a lot of Moe shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to wear light up devil horns to Moe
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Chucky would see me, he would
give me the devil horns with his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd always give me the devil's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a huge Moe fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my buddy Rob the Dude used to go
see a bunch of Moe shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, I don't know if you listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking better, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob the Dude was my road dog for so many
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen so many fish shows,
widespread panic shows, Moe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a ton of shows together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I got really ranty when we started
talking about music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to the Grateful Dead is sort of
a daily ritual for myself as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a lot of Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the Sirius XM in the car,
so I got the Grateful Dead radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I turn on the car, Jerry comes
on and starts singing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't get much better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still listen to a lot of Metallica,
Iron Maiden and Rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to a lot of Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lars is who I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the drums since I was 14 years
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the desk at school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the buckets wherever I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the fucking walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played whatever made noise probably from
when I was like seven years old until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born to be a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lars is kind of what triggered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know Lars is kind of a shitty
drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, but he's still that's what
started it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that he was terrible when I
was 12 years old and thinking that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: the coolest shit in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a cool weed related story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good segue to make this weed
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of how I became a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two uncles who are really cool
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Ron and Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another uncle also, but he wasn't
in this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Troy, love you too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love all three of my uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool fucking dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're part of why I am who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got traits of all of them in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of helped raise me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all my uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, Ron and Eric took me to my
first real concert when I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably 14 years old, I'm going to
guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I left California when I was 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to be 13 or 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have been any older than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take me to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bands were Jackal and the Damn
Yankees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know not the best bands ever,
but Jackal was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Damn Yankees, they could play
music, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, I was going to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to go have some fun and see
some boobs and hear some live music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at the Long Beach Arena,
I think, or the LA Sports Arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in LA or Long Beach in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a large place, but they
divided it in half by putting up a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: curtain so it could be a smaller venue for
these not A-level bands to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the way there, my uncle had a Chevy
El Camino, so it's got seats up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in the back, it's kind of like a
truck bed, but he had a camper shell on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all carpeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had some speakers back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Black Album from Metallica had
just come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever year that was, that's when
this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he played the Black Album from
Metallica all the way to the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my two uncles in the front of the car
smoked a fat joint during the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure I got pretty stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had smoked, I don't know that I had
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had smoked a couple times with my
buddy Chris and stuff by then,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wasn't really smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a nice contact high from their
joint in the front of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got nice and stoned and went and saw
Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a good weed related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's part of what that trip in the
car, me in the back of that Chevy El
[SPEAKER_00]: Camino, getting stoned off my uncle's
weed, listening to Sad But True is where
[SPEAKER_00]: something inside of me said, I'm a fucking
drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to play the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from then on, all I did was walk
around and air drum on everything and look
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was having a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just air drumming everywhere, doing big
drum fills in the air all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play the steering wheel, play the car
seat, play it all, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then anyway, that's part of how I got
addicted to the drums and it's cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never really into Iron Maiden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't really do it much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the other stuff you listen to,
bro, I think we could totally link up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Astro Haze from Wisconsin, shout out
for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving me an opportunity to
rant about music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music's one of my favorite things ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, is Astro Haze a white
zombie reference?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know white zombie was an Astro creep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a lot of Astro Haze sort of
references in his music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curious if that's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm missing something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for the long email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the opportunity to talk about
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have on this list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Oh, Barry Oh is a longtime podcast
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been listening to the show since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Oh says, he listens to the people
under the stairs and most deaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: which honestly, I know who most deaf is,
could not name a single fucking song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I'm going to sound racist
because I'm fucking ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that was most deaf in the
car with Dave Chappelle and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: driving around rapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking dope if that's who that
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not who that was, I'm fucking
racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be a racist guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know who the fuck all the
rappers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to drive around and listen to
Kendrick Lamar this weekend with my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got the new Kendrick Lamar on her
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my favorite kind of music.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when your kid's in the car,
you just let her listen to whatever she
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to because she's fucking cooler than
you guys and she wins anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super rambly today, you guys,
if you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this little head cold thing and I
took a bunch of dabs and it just made my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain fly out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not all focused, but who the fuck
needs to be focused for a podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be a little bit off the rails
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: See something happening in the recording
software that I need to make a note of
[SPEAKER_00]: around 12 minutes and 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to have to fix something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will never notice because I will
have fixed it by the time this goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is going to be straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call live to drive in the
recording industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to record it, put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably won't even edit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get to feel the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel like you're hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do now I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for my website sucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I corrected the three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you, I got a little bit of cold,
told you what my friends are listening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think we should read some iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to read the iTunes comments about
once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been pouring in more iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like the more I read them,
the more people send them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start just reading them instead
of rambling about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to send an eye comment on
iTunes, all you have to do is go to
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes, go to the iTunes store on the top,
right type in grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring up a little logo with the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a little section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the girl from your heart podcast
hosted by Rasta Jeff of I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a little spot that says
details, ratings and reviews and related.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is click on ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little part where it says,
write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type in whatever you'd like,
however you feel about the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will read your review on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody has given me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me as many stars as you feel I
deserve and I will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first comment that I'm going to read
was left on April 22nd by my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel Lynn, and it says, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it actually says congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, Jeff, on your 200th
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being back in North Carolina,
listening to your podcast in the apartment
[SPEAKER_00]: while we were packing up for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now while I'm, while I trim at work,
I look forward to an episode each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you for all the shout outs to
will and barefoot extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It warms my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had an awesome four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everything you do for the
cannabis community, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the huge support on iTunes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you couldn't tell by the review,
you guys, Rachel is the barefoot extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his lovely fiance, soon to be wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a, she was in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where will, Oh my, something just
went fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that happened to the
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys didn't hear that,
but in my headphones, it just went really
[SPEAKER_00]: wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be my whole not editing thing
going to shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fixed the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been identified and corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to this review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel is, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel is will's fiance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she used to, they used to live in
North Carolina before they came to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were out in North Carolina and she
was packing up the apartment, listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now she lives here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a trimmer and she still listens to
me while she's trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you must've been listening for a long
time because you've been here for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have an awesome four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your four 20 was as good as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was at work, but I was hanging out
with some of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: My work crew and I, we have become really
good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't too bad to be stuck at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're wondering, yes, we did sneak
away as promised at four 20 and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: was super medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of made it a short day that day
and shot it to Steph for trying to pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yes, I did have a good four 20
and, uh, Rachel, you're completely welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: for everything, uh, that you have received
from my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to you guys, you guys have been
good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came to my surprise birthday party and
hung out and you guys always make me
[SPEAKER_00]: amazingly delicious extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like it when you come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to just send Will to come
over and dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel, come dab with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come sit at the table, take some globs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love watching you take dabs because you
take bigger dabs than most of my guy
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and it's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come hang out and super huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Rachel gave me a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't she, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what friends are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to dabbing with you
sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come pick up some material so that we'll
can make me some more super good extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, she ended that, uh, that review with
a couple of multicolored hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing emojis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emojis make my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really rambling today, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you probably just turn me off by
now, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I still love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the next review comes from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can read your name because
it's, uh, it's not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jacob Ryan, but it's spelled kind of
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's J A Y K U B R Y A and Jacob Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review was left on April 11th of
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Jacob Ryan left me a five star
review and the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joe Rogan of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to hear more of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving to Colorado in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to meet and sesh with people
like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude just called me the Joe Rogan
experience of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Joe Rogan is my favorite, uh,
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan is one of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joe Rogan experience podcast is my
most listened to podcast, probably because
[SPEAKER_00]: he puts out nine to 12 hours of content
every fucking week and you can't stop
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be compared to my podcast hero,
to one of my favorite podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: to probably the number one most popular
podcast on the planet, uh, to be compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to Joe Rogan, that's a true honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you that I could just turn off
the mic right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mic drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go home and be a satisfied
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do that to you, but I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this podcast is, it's not a lot of
work, but it's a work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sit here for the duration of the
podcast and run my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got editing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to post the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a website to try and fucking
maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, uh, there's some work that
goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to hear people say, uh, that I'm the
Joe Rogan of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the people at the dude grows
cup, they told me how much I helped their
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and helped them succeed and how much
I've improved their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shit makes it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when people just say, Hey,
your words and your wisdom made my garden
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hey, you're the Joe Rogan of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking huge for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts some pride inside of my soul,
but you guys on Patreon, I still love you
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, don't act like I don't love
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but giving, being given praise like
that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more review to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think I'm all caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by, oh, we've got
another one of these long names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of letters pushed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tailored gardens, PDX, bud brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tailored gardens, PDX, bud brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently this person is from the
Portland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: On April 10th of 2017, of course they gave
me a five star review and it goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't begin to thank you enough for all
that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've made my brother and I excellent
growers and continue to share your
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and unique outlook on life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should totally check out our O M M P
grow on Instagram and maybe shout us out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tailored gardens, PDX and tailored
gardens, PDX, bud brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to make it down to Colorado and
take a fat dab with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signed Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also Jacob Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're coming in October and you
can't wait to meet and sesh with people
[SPEAKER_00]: like me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be snowing and shit by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sucks trying to travel around,
but hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back to tailored gardens,
bud brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty, a pretty smooth way to get
yourself a shout out on the podcast right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope a lot of people go check out your
Instagram, uh, tailored gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's T A I L O R E D then gardens,
PDX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out that Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys let them know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you come to Colorado,
tailored gardens, bud brother,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as Eugene, come take a fat dab
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it and you're very
welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you say you can't thank me enough for
all that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I've made you and your
brother, excellent growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least two people that have
learned something from me and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been talking for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I had to have been going for
at least 20 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is itching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicating that it needs a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause here for a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take myself a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to take a couple of
fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get back, we'll get into a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well caffeinated and I am ready to
rant for a few more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a couple of fat dabs of some
grateful dog shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was bred by me, grown by me and
extracted by our friends at the barefoot
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to barefoot extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I've got more material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come take some dad to pick up some
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some more hash going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of grateful dog, kind of random
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know about the grateful dog,
that doesn't correlate at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But speaking of grateful dog, somebody was
asking me about selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've done full episodes on male
selection and how to select male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I did not mention before,
something that I thought was a trick up my
[SPEAKER_00]: own sleeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I didn't know was so well known,
but I've seen it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I feel more comfortable sharing my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things I do like to keep to
myself, but it is time to share this
[SPEAKER_00]: little secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking to choose a male for
breeding, first of all, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go over the whole criteria on how to
select a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to look for
mainly shape, structure, aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it produce trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub the stem, smell your fingers,
see what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how long does it take to drop
pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will it drop pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long from the time it starts dropping
pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will it keep dropping pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things I like to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on and on about male selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another trick that you can use for
selecting a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, so let's say you grew out of 10
pack of seeds and there are, there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be five males in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good chance you'll get five
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually throw away the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first plant to show male, I don't want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be too male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to pass on too much of its
genes to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just going to have to get rid
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a copy of that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tossed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the second and third or fourth and
fifth one look like, look like candidates,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I will do is I will reverse those
males and turn them into females and
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them and see what they do as a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that again, because I
know a lot of people just scratch their
[SPEAKER_00]: heads and said, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take a male plant and I will treat
it with silver thiosulfate and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to flower that plant until it
turns into a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male plant will turn into a female
plant that will happen if you treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with silver thiosulfate appropriately and
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I continue to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those male flower clusters will turn in to
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be calyxes and they will form
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be 90% close to what that plan is
going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were actually the female,
it's going to be a little funky because
[SPEAKER_00]: you just fucked it up, but it's going to
give you a very good 90 to 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell you it's going to be
a hundred percent exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be super close to what that
plant would be like if it were a fee,
[SPEAKER_00]: a true female and it will show you the
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see, does it produce resin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make big chunky, heavy buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make pretty colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something desirable to use in
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have traits that I want to pass on
to make another creation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can reverse a male cannabis
plant using silver thiosulfate to turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a female and see what type of traits
you are passing on to your breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was quiet for a long time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are going to be
blown the fuck away by this because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking about it on Facebook and
when I saw it on Facebook, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are going to say, how do you
reverse a male plant or a female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have used the colloidal
silver method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be unreliable and not
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's redundant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unreliable and not effective, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to spray it too many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I order powdered silver and I think it's
powdered sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't ordered it in a long time,
so I haven't read it and it makes me feel
[SPEAKER_00]: dumb that I don't know what it is right
away, but I know what the shit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered the two powdered containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix them into jars of distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put so much of powder A into a jar,
so much of powder B into a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shake it with the distilled water so
that it really dissolves in there real
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put 50% of part A and 50% of
part B into more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix them into more water to make the
dilution that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each plant's going to need a different
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hit plants with straight up
undiluted, the undiluted mix before they
[SPEAKER_00]: get real burnt up, but they will reverse
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants prefer one heavy dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants prefer a few light doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants it's better to start hitting
them with the silver thiosulfate before
[SPEAKER_00]: you even flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to take some experimentation
on your part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do this, if you want to
reverse a male plant, or a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get the silver thiosulfate
solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before,
and I'm going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are playing with these chemicals,
they are chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please wear proper gloves, not just little
latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need thicker gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the proper safety equipment so
that you don't hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you're playing with any chemicals,
any pesticides, anything liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that can just end up in your eye
by fucking sneezing or bumping something
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, please wear some protective eye
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Oakleys, your Method 7, do not
fucking count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself some laboratory approved
glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please protect your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most sensitive organs exposed
to the elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only got two of them and you need them
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to walk around like a
pirate for the rest of your life because
[SPEAKER_00]: you made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please protect your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dilutions, I can post it on,
I can post it on, it'll be in the show
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the dilutions in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have to put silver thiosulfate
powders into the liquids and you mix those
[SPEAKER_00]: together into one container and then you
put that in a spray bottle and spray your
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant or your female plant,
whichever plant you're trying to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to get the stalks, not just the
leaves, get the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get the stalks of that plant
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to soak the plant with the silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend doing it seven to 10
days before you put it into flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is where you have to decide
if you want to hit it with undiluted
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate solution or if you want
to kind of dilute it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants like a 10% dilution,
some like 50, some need a 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit it with the undiluted,
the plants are going to crinkle up and
[SPEAKER_00]: look like you kicked the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will, however, reverse the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for pollen, they will make
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to turn it into a female,
it will turn it into a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be more gentle,
use a lighter dilution and spray more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently and start earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go hard a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fuck up the plant and it
will work or you can go light more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently and he won't see as much
damage, but it will take more,
[SPEAKER_00]: more sprays and more time to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to experiment with
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to spray that bitch every single day
to get her to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using silver thiosulfate at about a
30% dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would mix the two into the containers
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was calling that a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I mixed them, that was 100% of the
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would add water to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was calling my dilution
rates, my 50 to 30%, however much water I
[SPEAKER_00]: added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was calling the dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had half water, half my solution,
that was a 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat really needed to be
blasted a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that if I started blasting the
golden goat early, before I put her into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, like 10 days before I put it into
flower, spray every single day until I
[SPEAKER_00]: start seeing male plants, then it would
really reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't aggressive with it,
the golden goat would not reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I try to try to reverse?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pure aphi, the fucker reversed with
like just one strong spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hit it right at the start of flower
and the leaves curled up all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like day 14 of flower,
you could see those male, male plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: the male balls just building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't take much at all for the,
for the pure aphi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one just reversed right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't hear a lot about the pure
aphi because it sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't fun to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to throw shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just how stuff works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, my throat's burnt
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ADD is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
