[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 408 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of screaming
tangerines ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is labeled as 70.4% THC and 82.1%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little saucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer a little more crystals in
here, but the terpy flavor, that
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous screaming tangerine flavor
makes it worth that saucy consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm loving the flavor of this and it's
got a great head buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go back for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give everybody a huge thank you
for the reaction to my appearance on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of great emails,
a lot of great Instagram messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of great responses to
that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I want to thank all of my
friends at the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, all of the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see everybody at the Dude
Grows Cup on April 13th at Cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a lot of great messages,
but my favorite messages were about my
[SPEAKER_00]: dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, are those dreadlocks real?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old are those dreads?
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of compliments on the dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the dreadlocks are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dreadlocks are 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would untie them from the bun in
which they were in when I was on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go down to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit ridiculous because I
am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, the dreadlocks are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 14 years old and they go down to
my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've never seen a photo of me or
if you've wondered what I've looked like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go check out the
episode of the Dude Grows show that
[SPEAKER_00]: features Rasta Jeff from iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at a video, go see why they call
me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this episode, I do plan on reading
a few listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy doing the listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I owe a few
people some shout outs from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to Steve F,
a shout out to Keith Klump, a giant shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Riley H, how about a big grow from
your heart shout out to Matthew KW,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, a big shout out to my
friend, Todd K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like to learn how to
become a patron, you can do so by going to
[SPEAKER_00]: www.patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need to become a
patron will be right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I said I was going to read some listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a grow question,
if you need some grow guidance or some
[SPEAKER_00]: grow advice, or if you've got something
you'd like to say, you can send me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get your email on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in today's episode goes a
lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great podcast on the moon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes total sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, my Arise platoon
got a little stretch, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to put some meat on their bones
the last day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, also, Gollum has
devoured her twin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now that is a funny conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about he grew some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew some Arise seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them grew two seedlings,
two sprouts out of the one seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him that he should name it
after the nurse with the conjoined twin in
[SPEAKER_00]: South Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant got named Nurse Gollum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently, eventually, Nurse Gollum
devoured her twin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now just one plant, which is kind of
how Nurse Gollum turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, question, when I transplant into
one gallon fabric pots, can I plant them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little deep to help them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the rule of thumb on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what it sounds like is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy sprouted some Arise seeds and
they are getting a little tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably getting stretchy because
of a lack of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is probably not intense enough
or it is probably too far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your little plants, your little seedlings
are trying to stretch toward that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is their main source of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to get as close to that as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expecting sunshine and they're not
getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to climb up,
trying to get to that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've gotten a little bit stretchy,
a little bit leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to transplant these Arise
seedlings into a one gallon fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming at this point, you've got
them in something smaller, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: a beer cup or maybe something even a
little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got them in a Jiffy pot
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what you're doing,
but it is time to put these babies into a
[SPEAKER_00]: one gallon fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're asking if you can plant them a
little bit deep to help them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm thinking you mean you've got a
one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fill it up and then where
it should be full, you're going to knock
[SPEAKER_00]: out maybe one or two inches worth of soil
and then plant your plant there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: overfill it with that one or two inches of
soil so that you're going to bury part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant as to make it appear shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not popping out of the soil as
much, but in reality you still have that
[SPEAKER_00]: three inch long seedling or however long
it has grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like you've got an inch
popping out of the soil because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: buried two inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like those plants have gotten
too tall for you and you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize their height to kind of keep them
from toppling over, this is something you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this with a little tiny
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this when you're planting from
your beer cup into a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this when you're going from a
three gallon into a seven gallon or a
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallon into a 50 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing you need to be very careful
of is keep in mind that you were burying a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: However much of that stem is going into
the dirt that wasn't buried before,
[SPEAKER_00]: that part is not comfortable and not
familiar with being buried with dirt and
[SPEAKER_00]: being submerged and possibly being soaked
with water for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first few times you water,
you need to be careful to not soak that
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a fresh part of the plant that
has been exposed for the entire time of
[SPEAKER_00]: its life up until this time that you're
burying it and now you're going to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run the risk of some kind
of soggy root rot or something similar
[SPEAKER_00]: happening to that stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it would be stock rot at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to get funky in there if
you overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to get the water down deep
into the medium into those roots and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to drown that fresh stock part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to give that some time to adjust,
to acclimate to its new surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to do that,
be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a smaller plant, you're just going to
have to water maybe a little bit less,
[SPEAKER_00]: less water at a time and more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a larger plant, what you can do and
what you should be doing anyway with
[SPEAKER_00]: larger plants is water the outer perimeter
of the pot as to not soak the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot so much where that main stock is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to control where the
water goes, but if you've got a really
[SPEAKER_00]: large pot and you just water that outer
part where the root is, it's going to be
hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a three gallon pot and
you just put it into maybe a 10 gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just want that edge of the three
gallon, that outer exposed root,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be hit by that water, not the inside of
the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to aim the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
but you see what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get right at that edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ring you're trying to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The out of the three and the start of that
10, that fresh dirt, you're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: wet that part for the first couple of
waters to give that stick some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't get ridiculous and go burying it
really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the health of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the size of your stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the root mass you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention to what you're doing
and think about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the plant some breathing room and do
not drown it and do not smother it by
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it will work if you do it
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I'm going to recommend is
get a fan on those seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting too leggy, if they're
tipping over, they need more light and
[SPEAKER_00]: they need a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brighten up the light, get a fan on
them, give them a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of give them a little
struggle, give them some adversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come out stronger in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a little bit of a struggle
with that fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them kind of reach a little bit so
that they stand up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I've never really said here
on the podcast, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to touch on this just
because I was talking about watering the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the way your cannabis plants
are shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't interact with them,
they grow up and then they grow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of point down kind of in a
cone-shaped fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant gets whiter as it gets older.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets taller and whiter and taller and
whiter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing it continues to do is create
the same type of effect as a shingled
[SPEAKER_00]: roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the way the water flows,
go spray the top of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will run from the top leaves
down to the next set of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they do it, they come outward and
they come outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come further and further from the
center of the plant the more they drip
[SPEAKER_00]: down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water will keep continuing downward
and outward further away from the center
[SPEAKER_00]: of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a plant after it rains,
right underneath the plant is not wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that ring right around the plant,
it's really soaked with water because all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the water has run down and out and down
and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just making a wider and wider
ring as it runs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right around the plant,
it gets nicely watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when you're watering
your container plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to water the outer part where the
most active root tips are searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: water and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope there's some usable guidance in
there for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email does continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I've got some papaya females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to cross with one of these
arise males from my first cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for in King Solomon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super picky and super meticulous when
it comes to male selection, but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: done an entire podcast about breeding and
male selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 174 will help you out
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important part after you do
the male selection, after you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, the most important part of the
whole project is to test your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to grow the offspring and see
what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only way to know if that male
is delivering traits that are desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most important part is to test that
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part is to have fun
with your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a good male selection, pollinate
properly, let the seeds finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and dry them properly,
grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, make sure you have
fun with this breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I tried to make it so
uptight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to grow from my heart for a
minute there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, he wraps up this email and he
says, what's up Nemo punk 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got another listener sending a
big shout out to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is on vacation, but as soon as
he gets back, I'll give him a high five
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to our friend at left
field farms for this great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered all of your questions
and I look forward to hearing from you
[SPEAKER_00]: again in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a medical marijuana renewal
appointment set for just a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: from now, so I am going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take several ridiculous dabs
because I know I'm going to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting room for several minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to head to my medical
marijuana renewal appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will be back to resume this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys take a few dabs and I'll be right
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back and I am officially a registered
Colorado medical marijuana patient for one
[SPEAKER_00]: more full year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My appointment was fairly quick and fairly
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent more time in the waiting room
waiting to see the doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty familiar with that paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the paperwork several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to that doctor's office and seen
that doctor several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very familiar with the process and
it went fairly quickly and fairly smoothly
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a registered Colorado medical
marijuana patient for one more full year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to go back for another full
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue on with this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I was reading
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great email here in front
of me and this email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the grow series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been super informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not mention if the temps in veg
through harvest are the same when using
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people say to run temps at 85 degrees
in veg with CO2, but I'm not sure if you
[SPEAKER_00]: agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about temps through flowering with
CO2 and would you stop using CO2 at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signed Andrew M 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Andrew M 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for a great email and thank you
for pointing out that I missed a detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a long series of grow lessons and we
talked about growing all the way from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about temperatures and humidity
levels and one thing I overlooked was
[SPEAKER_00]: augmented CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are increasing CO2 to high
performance levels, we are able to run the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I did overlook that one detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree where you say some people
say to run temps at 85 degrees in veg with
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that that is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 to 85 degrees would be great for a room
running CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also run these high temperatures
through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I would slowly reduce the
temperature through the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to reduce the temperature,
kind of mimic the outside fall conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring out some of those colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also help bring out some of those
sweet flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps speed up the ripeness on
some longer flowering cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bring out that cold a little bit later
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe week seven, eight, nine,
kind of reduce the temperature a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit every week and bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the second half of this question is,
would you stop using CO2 at some point in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 can become very expensive depending on
the size of your room and the efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: of your room, how sealed up your room is,
how often you're exhausting the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just blowing the CO2 right
out with your HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 can become very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an ideal world, I would not stop using
CO2 ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants would go into a room with CO2
from day one and all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, they would be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a high CO2 augmented environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I do not stop augmenting CO2 later
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like running it all the way through,
even when I do begin reducing those
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that once you've started increasing
CO2, it is really detrimental to the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of the plants if you stop
giving it that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, CO2 is kind of the last
thing you should add to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the turbo charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your nitrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got the nutrient regimen
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the light dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to take good care of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you add the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the last bonus step of the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That CO2 is what is going to push you over
the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But learn how to grow before you add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you are turbo charging your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got everything dialed in and you're
pushing that turbo button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've been pushing that turbo button
for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're feeding those plants a high,
high performance diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we've got all of the
nutrients dialed in, if we've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights dialed in, the CO2 is dialed in,
we are certainly in a high performance
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about if you take that CO2 away
and you try to feed those plants the same
[SPEAKER_00]: feed regimen, they're not going to have
one of their things that works them out to
[SPEAKER_00]: make that high performance diet all click
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be able to metabolize
as much food if we are not giving them the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 that they were familiar with getting
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I put you on a solid workout
routine and I started feeding you like a
[SPEAKER_00]: savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave you the best athletic diet that
science could dial in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you got that diet solid,
you're good at your workout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a good foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to give you some steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're lifting more than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running faster than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the 420 million dollar man at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now one day I'm just going to stop
giving you all of your protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to keep giving you the
steroids and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to expect the same
performance from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting all of the parts of the
cogs that make those wheels turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere something is going to blow
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you stop inducing CO2 in the
plants after they're really used to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really let you know that they miss
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, we want that shit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to run laps as fast as I
used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start getting slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start getting droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that money that you spent on
CO2 for those six weeks in flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: however many weeks in veg, now they're
kind of not even worth it because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just negating that by not inducing or
augmenting or increasing the CO2 levels to
[SPEAKER_00]: a high performance environment later in
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my long answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would not stop using CO2 at some
point in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use CO2 all the way through flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan it in your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can predict that you are going to
be low on funding toward the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, try to budget your CO2 money
late in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use as much CO2 for the first couple
of weeks so that you can save that funding
[SPEAKER_00]: for the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the last few weeks of flour
when that CO2 is really going to push
[SPEAKER_00]: those big beefy flours to that extra
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about your budget and try to plan
ahead and try to spend your CO2 budget
[SPEAKER_00]: wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Andrew M14, I want to thank you for a
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if anybody out there would like to
send me a grow question or any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or a cannabis related email,
my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next email in my pile goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, first off, thank you for the
hard work you put into the podcast and for
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it and I have learned
an absolute ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Secondly, I have a couple of
questions that I hope you can find the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to help me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that Lemon Jeffrey is sold out
online at the several seed banks you
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any sort of timeline when you
expect to have those genetics available
[SPEAKER_00]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question because I can
tell you that from the time of this
[SPEAKER_00]: recording, those Lemon Jeffrey seeds will
be available in approximately 80 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording this in the first week of
April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got about 80 days and we will
have more Lemon Jeffrey seeds available
[SPEAKER_00]: and those will be available at
OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get the first batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check there in about 80
days from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be April.
[SPEAKER_00]: May, probably the middle of June,
possibly the start of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have Lemon Jeffrey seeds and
several more feminized Golden Goat crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: available through OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that is at OregonEliteSeeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part says, Also, I purchased a
pack of Arise from Helladank and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: super excited to grow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for purchasing those and
thanks for having the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise, that is one of my favorite crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super high THC, super hyper vigor,
just a great plant to grow overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I think I would like to
cross a strong indica to your Arise for my
[SPEAKER_00]: own personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do encourage breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with you using my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've bought my seeds, they're
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, make sure you give me credit when
you post pictures or if those seeds go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you put Arise in the little
listing of what the cross is so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people know what you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were a big sativa guy,
but I am wondering if you can suggest a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong indica strain you think may be a
good pairing to match with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up this email by saying,
if you do end up reading this aloud,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much from Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Kevin, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about a great
pairing for Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise was bred from a Golden Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got that tropical sativa flavor
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a lot of nutrients,
really vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also bred from a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of has a fresh tennis ball,
fresh rubber kind of a smell, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: that OG Kush funky, dank, dirty feet kind
of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arise is a very unique cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very beautifully balanced 50-50
hybrid with very unique pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really great cross in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it works so perfectly for so
many environments and it produces so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cross this Arise to something
more indica dominant to where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: create an indica heavy product for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to smoke more of an indica type
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel if you cross the Arise to something
more indica dominant, you could possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: carry that Arise Potency, that Arise Hyper
Vigor into something that is more indica
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy, maybe something that grows shorter
and squattier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that indica potency up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about how you would do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you intend to use an Arise male or do
you intend to use an Arise female?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first thing you need to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I would think about is
when it comes to the opposite,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to use another male or
female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to acquire this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have access to good seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have access to a large variety or
is your access slightly limited?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got access to clones,
you're either going to be using this other
[SPEAKER_00]: cross as your pollen receiver as the
female or you may be making a feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of variables to think
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of some of my favorite
indica heavy cultivars or varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available that you may be able to get
your hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I would honestly enjoy seeing
worked would be an Arise male put to an LA
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential female from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the progeny would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have access to LA confidential
from DNA Genetics, I would certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would recommend would
probably be the Cataract Kush or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to find a good male of the
Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they are only selling those
in feminized seeds at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have considered getting a female or
getting a clone and reversing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is not what I want to do at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have a Kosher Kush male
from the old school Kosher OG seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA released years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to see happen is you
find a good male from that Arise pack and
[SPEAKER_00]: put that pollen on the Kosher,
the Cataract, or the LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, all three of those are from DNA
Genetics or Reserva Provoto, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: their little offshoot company,
but I really appreciate their indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they make a good OG Kush indica
kind of a line and I really respect those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys and all of their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you plan to use an Arise male and
you can't name him Solomon, that's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to come up with your own name,
but you can still use an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use that, I would
recommend pollinating something on the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush heavy side if you want something more
indica dominant to come out of your cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something short, something stout,
something with big fat leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that doesn't take very long to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Bubba Kush would be a fun cross to
go to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to use an Arise female as
your pollen receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still consider those first three
strains I mentioned, the Cataract,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kosher, and the LA confidential,
but I would also try to find something
[SPEAKER_00]: with big fat leaves, short and squat,
with really indica dominant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know what is available to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got my seeds, so it sounds
like you've got access to plenty of good
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a super heavy indica strain
that gets your attention, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: has the traits which you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you were going to get from
your progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you put in is what you get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get 50% of the male,
50% of the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mash it up, and you're
going to get all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions of the different traits that
are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a male with big fat leaves
and a short squat stature because that
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise probably gets fairly tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably got fairly skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it is sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find something with heavy
indica genes so that way you can dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way those indica genes are real
dominant, real prevalent in your cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, something that just hit my mind,
a strain that I should recommend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Durango OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Durango OG would pair beautifully
with the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of hosing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can't make these crosses since I'm
giving everybody else the ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think Durango OG and Arise,
either direction, either one is a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: either one is a female, I think they would
both work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be fun is if you got a pack of
seeds of Durango OG, you got a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of Arise, and you grew both of them
out, and you found a stellar male from
[SPEAKER_00]: each pack and a stellar female from each
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a boy Arise and a girl
Arise, and you've got a male Durango OG
[SPEAKER_00]: and a female Durango OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do two separate breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross the male Arise to the girl Durango
and the girl Arise to the male Durango,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then observe the differences in both
of the progeny of your projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can really dial it in and find
what you want for your personal medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, this breeding
project, any kind of breeding Arise back
[SPEAKER_00]: to some indica sounds like a very exciting
project, and I'm sure that if you start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a good, solid indica plant that is
either going to be the male or the female,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will get something that
satisfies you in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a lot of stuff to play with,
and something in that batch of seeds will
[SPEAKER_00]: be your keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cracking a pack of seeds is a lot
like buying a pack of baseball cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I guess nowadays you'd say Magic the
Gathering cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you open the pack, you go
through, you always get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: commons, maybe a couple of uncommons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then toward the back, there's always
that one rare card that you are super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you find your Mickey Mantle
early on in your female hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do the male selection,
the female selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do the pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to watch all the time that those
seeds develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the funnest part, in my opinion,
is growing out those seeds to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to look for that Mickey Mantle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope you enjoy this breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I recommended a few strains,
and I know I went both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure your goal or your intention
other than to make an Endica dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: cross from the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I have led you in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really look forward to seeing
pictures of the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you make these seeds, I want you to
grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what male you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what female you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see how those seeds turn out
for you.
