[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 445 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has become a tradition that
we start this podcast off by talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dads of watermelon
gelato ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms, the potency label says
this product contains 64.6% THC and 76.7%
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking open the jar right now so I
can give it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first smell that hits my face is
exactly watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like watermelon candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is sort of a funky,
gassy thing in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dab it, it tastes like fresh
watermelon candies with a hint of green
[SPEAKER_00]: apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the watermelon gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to address a couple of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that people asked me about correcting
powdery mildew and handling bugs in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I'd like to do a
shout out to a few of my friends on

[SPEAKER_00]: in the present, and in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I said I was
going to address a question about spray
[SPEAKER_00]: applications to take care of powdery
mildew and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in an Instagram live feed today and
somebody kept asking questions about what
[SPEAKER_00]: they can spray to take care of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they asked what they can spray to
take care of their bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, spraying is a good way to minimize a
pest population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying is a good way to minimize
potential powdery mildew problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But spraying products is not a long-term
solution to cure problems in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that for a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in this person's garden are
obviously displaying that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: infected with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's going to be really easy to grab
a product and spray it all over those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and wash that powdery mildew off
and act like we have just solved the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it may be cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the product you applied,
depending on the environment, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions, that powdery mildew has a
very good potential of coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you did was give that plant a little
bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not destroy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not kill that powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just rinsed it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably just spread it out to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your powdery mildew is going to come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have done is a temporary fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's gone, but it is going
to come back and it is going to be worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what are you going to do when it
comes back with a vengeance?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a little powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sprayed it with a product that kind of
knocked it down for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it came back, it was even
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spray again so that it can
come back even stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the plants get older,
as the cycle progresses, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get big fat juicy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to spray those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to consume your buds that
were sprayed with any sort of product that
[SPEAKER_00]: is used to treat powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once your plants get big fat buds,
if you continue to spray them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to destroy the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to destroy the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to burn funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buds are going to taste funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of commercial grow environments,
I see people attempt to use a sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: burner to make minimize the risk of
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works to get rid of powdery mildew,
but it also puts a terrible shitty sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor in the finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you turn that finished product
into a concentrate, it makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate taste like burnt fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not use a sulfur burner in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will argue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to taste it and it will
ruin your concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly advise against the sulfur
burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just going to keep spraying
forever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying will not last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying is like a temporary band-aid for
whatever problem you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a giant gash on your arm,
you need some stitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just going to keep putting little
band-aids over it every day and hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit closes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just going to suck it up and go to
the ER and get seven stitches and get that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit fixed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to just bite the bullet
and fix the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to figure out the problem and you
need to correct the issue and quit
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying will get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a small garden, it may not add
up as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a commercial environment,
spraying a large room will become very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you have to buy whatever product
you are going to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a large room, a large
facility, you're buying a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need an applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your grow,
the size of your environment, you need
[SPEAKER_00]: something that can effectively and
efficiently cover all of your plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticide product you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've got the products,
you need to pay somebody to apply that
[SPEAKER_00]: product to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using manpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they're damaging the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're decreasing the overall quality of
your finished product by applying that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you are cutting that room off for
work for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, a pesticide application
will have a re-entry interval in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: are not allowed to enter that room until
that time period has passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most pesticides have a minimum of a
four-hour re-entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, that is half of a work
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will eliminate access to that room
for the rest of the staff for probably
[SPEAKER_00]: half the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was more work to be done in
there, you're shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do any of the extra catch-up
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put up trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do any popping and twisting
because that room is off limits now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is under a re-entry interval and the
door is marked, do not enter until this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So applying pesticides will become costly
and in the long run, correcting the issue
[SPEAKER_00]: that is causing the problem will be more
efficient than reapplying pesticides every
[SPEAKER_00]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even think about the cost of
training an employee to spray that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That employee has to be trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have Department of
Agriculture pesticide safety training if
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to apply a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have an OSHA respirator fit
certification which means they have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to a doctor and they have to put on the
respirator that they intend to use when
[SPEAKER_00]: they apply pesticides and they have to
show that they know how to put on that
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to show that it fits them
correctly around their face and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: no air leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have to show that they can
remove it correctly without getting
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides on their face and they also
have to show that they can clean it and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an expensive class.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an expensive doctor appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another thing that you have to
pay for when it comes to a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have to pay for all of the
personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time somebody applies a pesticide,
they need to suit up in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that I am responsible for wears a
full Tyvek suit when they're applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're suited up from head to toe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the hood up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the appropriate goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my dudes wear that big full face
mask respirator that covers your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like the fucking SWAT team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wear at least six millimeter thick
gloves depending on the pesticides we are
applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it's a six millimeter,
sometimes a little bit thicker of a glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the appropriate gloves based on
the pesticides we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're suited up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shit is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Tyvek suits are one time use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in the room, you spray,
you get coated in pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take that suit off and throw it
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically do your best to step out of
it without touching it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those respirator cartridges, those are
expensive to replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The respirators are quite expensive to
replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the gloves we go through are
extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go through them in the volumes
that we do in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, all of those little costs
will add up and in the long run,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever was causing your powdery mildew
issue would probably have been cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: just to correct that in one big bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good way to segue into some of
the things that are probably causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the most common cause of
powdery mildew is an incorrect VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a full episode on VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in learning a lot
about vapor pressure deficit, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 314 of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually titled, Vapor Pressure
Deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode will teach you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think VPD is the most common cause
of powdery mildew and that includes
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive heat and high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I think really
contributes to powdery mildew is
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature swings, diurnal temperature
swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your day and night temperature
change, if your day is 80 degrees and your
[SPEAKER_00]: night is 60 degrees, you are giving
yourself a really good opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to have more than a 5 to 7 degree
swing in your diurnal temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 degrees max, maybe 12 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see you stay within 5 to 7
degrees temperature swing from day to
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 degrees is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 degrees is pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 20, you're going to start causing
yourself problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I think often
contributes to powdery mildew is excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: water left in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I see small puddles in a
commercial environment just because shit
[SPEAKER_00]: happens in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're cleaning things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're watering things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just spill some shit and
there is water left in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a bucket left somewhere
with water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the tables, the flood to drain
tables, will get clogged with debris at
[SPEAKER_00]: the drain and you don't clean that out and
then the table will get a little layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start seeing that little green
algae build up on your table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also contribute to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I think contributes to
powdery mildew is improper air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about in a previous episode,
people squish their plants too close
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will contribute to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need some fans in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move some air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another critical thing, you can't
just move air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get that old stagnant air out
and put some fresh air in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a humidifier and you need air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks may be working a sealed
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are advanced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand how to control the
environment and keep things safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're running a sealed environment,
I'm pretty confident in their skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running CO2 to augment the CO2 to
keep the CO2 high in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need much advice on keeping the
powdery mildew under control, hopefully at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I see that people commonly
overlook when they are starting to have
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew issues is defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got powdery mildew on a leaf,
why not pull the damn leaf off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is less opportunity for a bug or a
piece of mildew to attach itself to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less places to hang out, less things to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just good logic in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you will reduce the amount of water
that those plants release into the air
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are not as many leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, there aren't as many mouth
breathers in there spitting out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, defoliate and that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that will help you
tremendously is to just basically clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really important to clean up the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, clean your tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going from one plant to another
plant or from one table to another table,
[SPEAKER_00]: why not just dip your scissors into some
rubbing alcohol and dry them off with a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and keep moving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilize your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if one plant's infected with
something, you don't move it right along
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire garden, which is
another great way to segue into this next
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any of this shit written
down, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all flying out of the top of my
head just so that you know that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I was going to talk about
is infected clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that I see people bring
powdery mildew into a grow is by bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: a clone from a friend or a dispensary or
wherever that had powdery mildew on that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, clones travel around our
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, clones may happen to go across
the country in a sealed baggie and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also inside of a box and they are moved
from one point to another and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: left in that packaging for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, when those clones are opened up,
they have developed powdery mildew inside
[SPEAKER_00]: that packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person who received that package is so
excited to get that new clone that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give a shit about the powdery
mildew, they forget to look, they pot that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone into a little bit of dirt,
they put it right into the general
[SPEAKER_00]: population of their grow room,
they put it right next to the fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then in three or four days,
the entire room has got a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very, very common way for folks
to get PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a clone from a friend,
you get a clone from a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you get a clone from a friend online
or something like that and it ends up in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow and you have now contaminated
your entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a new plant from anybody,
I don't care if it's your best friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's your mama,
I don't care if it's your mentor,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get a new clone from anybody,
quarantine that clone and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is pest and pathogen free before you
introduce that plant into your general
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a responsible gardener, you cannot
blame your friends, your fellow growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever gave you that clone for giving you
powdery mildew, spider mites, thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever comes with that plant is not
their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your fault for not being responsible
and treating that clone as if it had every
[SPEAKER_00]: bug and pathogen on the planet when it was
brought to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility to make sure
that plant is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks their garden is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks their plants are pest and
pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those people are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have found is the people who boast
the most about having a clean and pest and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen free garden are the ones with the
most problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just haven't discovered the problems
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I have talked about how we
get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have talked about how sprays are only
temporarily effective and how they will
[SPEAKER_00]: not solve the problem for long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about things we can do to
correct the room and make sure we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: get powdery mildew ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, let's start treating any
incoming plants with proper pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: proper fungicide sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yes, I have been ranting that sprays
are not the solution to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're bringing something in,
you want to spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to treat it so that you don't
introduce a problem to the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want somebody else's problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't correct their room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's correct the plant that they
brought us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we have to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's make sure that the room we are
going to put that new plant into is
[SPEAKER_00]: proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure we have got the proper
VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave it up to you to
understand and study VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I did a podcast all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode 314.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your VPD dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your temperature and humidity dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your airflow dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't have any micro
climates in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is, is it 80 degrees over
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 72 degrees over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 68 degrees down here under this
canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need enough airflow to keep a
homogenous environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it 80 degrees over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 degrees over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% humidity over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% humidity over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want big swings and jumps
throughout the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe another thing that you may need
is a proper grow room monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that can actually monitor the
VPD of your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay attention to those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't know what's going on in there,
we don't know what is causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dial in the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial in the temperature and the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your airflow up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove any excess water that does not need
to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're overwatering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you were trying to saturate your
medium a little too heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to saturate a little less
and let the medium dry and then water
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of one big fat watering through
the day, maybe do two medium waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you have less water in the air,
less water in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I highly suggest to help you
minimize the potential of powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: is to de-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less leaf in the room, the less
potential for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also suggest that you dial in your
diurnal temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want drastic swings from your
day and night temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure things aren't going crazy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure your humidity swings aren't
crazy when your lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the lights on all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is putting heat in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is making the water rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that moisture is in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes crazy in the room for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the proper monitoring gear,
you can see what is happening at the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on and lights off in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of cases, that is where we start
developing powdery mildew problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're not getting
temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not getting humidity
spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing we can think about is
to make sure that none of the air being
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn into the room is extremely cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers like to pull air from outside
during the winter because they think that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps cool the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually giving you a huge
potential for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing that cool air into the
warm grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to create moisture and that
will begin to create perfect conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take some time to correct your
vapor pressure deficit, get your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and your humidity dialed in,
make sure that your airflow is proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe add a few fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe add an extraction fan so that you
can suck that humidity out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe add an intake fan so that you can
suck some fresh air into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some small adjustments will help you
minimize the risks of getting powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something that just came to my
mind when I was talking about moving air
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something funny that I see in a
lot of commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got multiple flowering rooms and
multiple bedrooms in one big building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, there's a hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most facilities, there's one long
hallway with flowering rooms all along one
[SPEAKER_00]: side and flowering rooms all along another
side just separated by walls and doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically like an apartment building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a long hallway and you got
apartment A, apartment B, apartment C,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then on the other side, you got D,
E, and F, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I do them letters and numbers just
because I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of facilities I see, they're
ducting the heat straight out of room A
[SPEAKER_00]: into that hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ducting that heat straight out of
room B into the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ducting the heat from room C into
the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, their air conditioner intake is in
the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just dumping hot air into the
hallway and then trying to suck that right
[SPEAKER_00]: back up through the air conditioner
intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that humid air, all that stagnant air
is just going right back into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fighting yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about efficiency that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you heating up a room where you're
pulling your air conditioning air through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you humidifying a room that you're
trying to dehumidify?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you dumping the hot air into a room
where you're fighting yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about air efficiency when it
comes to designing your HVAC system and
[SPEAKER_00]: where the heat and humidity end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think of one clear example where
there's a grow facility where they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: their heat ducts shooting the heat,
their extractions shooting the heat right
[SPEAKER_00]: into the hallway, but then right across
that hallway is an intake fan sucking what
[SPEAKER_00]: should be fresh cool air into that
flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually sucking all of that heat
straight out of the other room into that
[SPEAKER_00]: room, and it heats up that room
perpetually, and that room never gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cooled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that room has been designated as a veg
space because they can't figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them, spend a few bucks,
redirect your air, and that problem will
[SPEAKER_00]: be solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that is not how all owners
see things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather just make the grow team
struggle and make it hard on them and then
[SPEAKER_00]: yell at everybody because they can't reach
production goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, all too often that is how a
commercial grow environment will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point of this 20 minute rant,
you guys, is that sprays are not a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprays are temporary quick fixes that will
not solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just keep spraying forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to spray every three days?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be buying personal
protective equipment every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be buying more pesticide
and more fungicide every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix all those air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix all the ducting gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just solve the bullshit, and your whole
grow will be more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's shift gears and talk about the
same thing, but we're going to focus more
[SPEAKER_00]: on pests this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most often, pests come in on clones or you
bring them in the grow yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they find the most minute crack in the
walls and they sneak their way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that most commonly,
they come in with a clone or they come in
[SPEAKER_00]: on your clothes, on your shoes,
or you bring them in from your home grow
[SPEAKER_00]: or from your commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a friend that grows at
home or you've got multiple friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow at other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys all go hang out at the same
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sit on the same couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: His thrips crawl onto your shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your spider mites crawl onto his shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you both have thrips and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that since everybody is
growing cannabis, we are all just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly trading bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to think about pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go into your grow, change into
your dedicated grow room clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have grow room shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have some grow room pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have grow room shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a separate grow room hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just wear your normal hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want separate clothes for your grow
space so that when you come in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow, you're basically wearing your
uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help you out in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only going to get pesticides on
those clothes because when you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, if you've applied a pesticide,
every time you rub up against that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and that wall, you're now getting
pesticides on your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have some designated clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have designated shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be, I'm a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out hiking on the trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go take my mountain shoes
into my grow room or into a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and think about whatever kind of bugs
I may have picked up out near Red Rocks or
[SPEAKER_00]: out at the Canyon Trail and take that shit
into a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day I walk in and they're fucking
aphids everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I would be so mad at myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get yourself some dedicated grow room
shoes, some dedicated grow room clothes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial facility,
I almost recommend changing if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a lab coat or if you've got the
opportunity to change clothes between big
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms, I would definitely suggest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a room in a commercial
facility that is contaminated with bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: make that the last room you work on every
day so that you don't start in that room,
[SPEAKER_00]: get yourself coated in spider mites and
then drag them through the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start in the cleanest room, then work your
way to the dirty room and then go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't take those bugs through
the rest of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're probably going to take
them home, but as soon as you get home,
[SPEAKER_00]: drop those clothes in the dirty clothes
pile, take a quick shower, put on some
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh clothes or put on your grow room
clothes, then head to your grow room and
[SPEAKER_00]: handle your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to switch clothes before grow
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend switching clothes between
your indoor and outdoor grow space if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand switching clothes can be
quite time consuming if you need to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got a couple of lab coats
or something you can switch in and out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do anything you can to minimize the
opportunity of bringing a stowaway pest
[SPEAKER_00]: from grow to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think some of the most efficient ways
to prevent yourself from getting spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites is to treat any clones that come
into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like that any plant that comes into
your grow has got all of the bugs and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like that thing is a trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to treat that plant for spider
mites, for thrips, for aphids and for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew before you even think about
bringing it into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, change clothes and keep
yourself clean from grow to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the grow store, if you go to
some grow meeting, if you go to a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: class, I would definitely change clothes
before you enter your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also need to think about
long-term pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to apply pesticide sprays
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually any pesticide will die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have a very short shelf life
unless you're going with something pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will need to find a better
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly suggest predator mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like predator bugs in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most popular pest management
instructors has coined the phrase no bug
[SPEAKER_00]: can build a resistance to being eaten,
which is a great statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep applying pesticides to our
pests, they're going to build a resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep spraying Azimax on your spider
mites, you are going to create an Azimax
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start drinking it and spitting
it back in your face and laughing at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to rotate your pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get into flower, you release
those predator mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing has a resistance to being eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a little tiny spider mite and a
great big hungry predator mite comes by,
[SPEAKER_00]: your food, you're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest switching to predator
bugs early in flower, if not late in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a little note that I've been
talking about just randomly when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching classes and talking about pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think many people are prioritizing their
plants backwards when it comes to pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people focus on the plants that have
the big fat buds that are almost ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, that are really photogenic,
that are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That management is going to come in and
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people focus on keeping those plants
pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend starting the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the mother plants and the
small clones are the most important plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep pest free because that is where
everything starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow that is contaminated,
I would start working on the mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and the veg plants first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants that are in flower,
their numbers are up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their time is counting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be cut down and removed
from your facility in just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mother plants, they're there for a
much longer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to deal with them much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to correct their problems,
get them happy, get them healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the mother plants are the start of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother plants are where it all comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a happy, healthy mother plant so
that you can get a happy, healthy clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can have happy, healthy veg
plants, so that we can have happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy flowering plants, so that we can
have big, fat, juicy, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy buds, so that in turn we can have
happy, healthy patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need happy, healthy mother plants to
make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make all of that happen, you need a
happy, healthy, clean, dialed-in grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I think this was a

removed Cannabuzz from their application
[SPEAKER_00]: store, but Cannabuzz is in the process of
adding an Android download link to their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, so you will be able to directly
download the app from their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work just like it did before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not available in the Android
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of being haters on the
cannabis-focused application, so they shut
[SPEAKER_00]: us down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application will be available on the
Cannabuzz website very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to join us on Cannabuzz.
