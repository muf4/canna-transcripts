.com You know, I like to start the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: off by talking about what I'm smoking
today I've been taking little tiny dabs of
[SPEAKER_00]: purple starburst live batter from green
dot labs This is a blend of purple punch
[SPEAKER_00]: and skittles starburst og the flavor on
the package is described as Spun sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: grape and shampoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about this concentrate on
the show before I really love that sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh sugary shampoo flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of tastes like cotton candy
shampoo And I really like it show the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera there a little bit if you're
watching on youtube You can see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: batter looks like that started off as a
four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made a nice dent in the jar Really
quality concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the buzz and I really love
the flavor So big shout out to our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: at green dot labs I'm sure some of you
noticed I said I was taking little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not being facetious in any way I've
had a little bit of dental work done So I
[SPEAKER_00]: must stick with little tiny dabs so I
don't cause myself any problems If you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching on the video, you may notice that
one side of my face is a little bit puffy
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm recovering quite well and
I'm ready to do a show the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna notice is this red puffiness
and some words don't come out right
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've had dental work and I'm
adjusting to the new face, but I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: will be okay bear with me make fun of me
if You'd like to that's what we're here
[SPEAKER_00]: for but let's move forward to a podcast I
just wanted to make sure you guys know why

[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we need to go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the dentist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm red and puffy a little bit,
but we're going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got one more appointment and
then we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move right forward to the breeding
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next note on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep you guys updated on what is
happening in my gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you've been following along,
you know that I found a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: male and I have recently pollinated a few
select females in a small area with that
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols are brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols are curled up on all of the
females, which indicates to me that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: got a successful pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made Jack the Ripper F2s from two
different phenotypes of a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also made, excuse me, I've also made
a couple of Jack the Ripper outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pollinated a couple of very popular
irie genetics lines and irie genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses with the Jack the Ripper male
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the pollen has taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that the pistols have curled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pollinate a plant, the pistols,
the hairs, you guys, the main function of
[SPEAKER_00]: those hairs on the plant, those are to
receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sticking out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're long and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got them nice and long and thick,
that's when they really want pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the plant is really heavily
ovulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The job of that hair is called a pistol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its job is to catch pollen and the pollen
slides down that hair into the ovule and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the seed is formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where future generations come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those pistols are brown and crinkled
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already been used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the ovule inside of there
doesn't need pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pistol just curls up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells me I've been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a room filled, a tent filled with
brown pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be so many fucking
seeds in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all brand new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the females I've used produce
quality offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the Jack the Ripper is a
quality cross, but I do not know how the
[SPEAKER_00]: male I selected will play with the females
I have pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people right now are getting
excited going, man, I can't wait to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those Jack the Ripper crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be very, very patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got four to six weeks to let
the seeds grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to harden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to get shells on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got four to six weeks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a month and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will honestly hang for two solid
weeks before I do anything to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I harvest seeded plants, I let them
dry, crispy, crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I shuck the buds off the sticks into
a container and I smash the buds up into
[SPEAKER_00]: small dust with my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of roll the buds in my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so dry that it crumbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it crumbles, you just hear the
seeds rain out into the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take that container filled with
crumbled up bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just dry, shaky bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you could just roll a bunch
of joints out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run that through a machine that
separates the material from the seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is it's not going to be
right away before these seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got six weeks before they're
harvested, two weeks to let them dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: another week to pull them out and get the
seeds sorted, separated, labeled and
[SPEAKER_00]: counted because I do count them all before
they go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to know how many seeds I made from
each harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once I've got them separated,
counted, labeled, all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when I can think about testing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will test them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow a batch of these seeds on my own
before anybody gets to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make sure we get good germination
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure that we don't have any
hermaphrodites, any weird mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure that the females that come
out of this cross are worth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of work to be done before
I can give any out, before I can share
[SPEAKER_00]: any, before I can sell any, before you can
have them play with them, test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once I have tested them, so you're
looking at six weeks, two weeks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: another four or five week veg,
nine week flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at like 22 weeks by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere around there, then you may be
able to see some testers because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll send testers out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're looking at fucking 18 to 20
weeks before testers have results and
[SPEAKER_00]: finishers and photos and tests and all
that shit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like 40 something weeks before
anybody is going to get to play with these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the excitement for new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just as excited as you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I start talking about it,
it's going to be six months to a year
[SPEAKER_00]: before it is released to the market if,
if it even makes it to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are crosses that I've made that will
not go to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share them with friends and I'll say,
Hey, this isn't the best for this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but I know what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may work well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give them a warning, but there are
some things I make that are just not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go out to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need experienced growers and veterans
who can keep an eye on some shit to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they make it to the market,
it will be, what did I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 weeks ish, 42 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the better part of a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting off 10 weeks of a year
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, give me a year or so,
six months to a year before I get these
[SPEAKER_00]: testers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you were so patient to listen to my
ramblings, maybe I should be nice enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you about a couple of the females
that I've put in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me, you already know that I
put a female of one of my favorite cuts in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw a rise number four in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have a Jack the Ripper male
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: A female arise number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four is the keeper that you guys
see on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others, but number four is the
stellar champion that I've fallen in love
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have, it's actually going to be
a rise XJTR because you list the female
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a rise cross to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, what else did I put in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, there is a golden goat female in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a golden goat female in there
about to get pollinated or pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have Goat Ripper or Jack the Goat
or somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a name idea for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper cross to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you about one more just while
we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Jack the Ripper F2s in there or F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much I want to share and
how much I want to keep secret,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe there's a platinum tangy in
there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have some really orange
Jack the Ripper turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that's what's going on in the
breeding room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing in the breeding room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using Canon LED lighting from Black
Sail Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please support Black Sail Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay for advertising on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am running their lights and I fucking
approve you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants look really healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew with good vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew with really thick and robust
stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are really thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel thicker than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel thicker than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's because of the VPD in
that room or if it is because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it may be from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting more, I think the better light
is giving me chloroplast development,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is building thicker, stronger
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that is accurate,
but it's my assumption from what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they went into flower more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I flipped these plants into flower
under the LEDs, they really took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male was like, oh, you want pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'll pollinate for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girls were like, you want me to
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no problem flipping into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really impressed with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough input on this seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about the seed development
because seeds have not really gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky or fat yet, but I'm excited to see
how the seeds develop under the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being able to take photographs
without having to turn off my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm growing under HID lights,
I turn off all the HID lighting to take
[SPEAKER_00]: photos or you get those shitty yellow
washed out photos underneath the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting out kick-ass bright white
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get really beautiful photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That white light combined with a phone
flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can just kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about some Jack the
Ripper crosses that will be coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening in my grow,
in my breeding space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to keep you guys updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've gone on long enough about
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can we go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of people supporting the show
on Patreon now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that if you support the show on
Patreon and you send a question,
[SPEAKER_00]: those questions get sent to the top of the
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel that Patreon contributors
should get priority message reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with some Patreon
messages for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, if you're not
supporting the show on Patreon and you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do so, simply visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to sign up and
contribute to the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon message for today's
episode goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the knowledge you put
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has helped my growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is a great ad from our friend
Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Vincent, thank you for the great
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I hope you're watching or listening
to the show, bro, because Vincent says you
[SPEAKER_00]: are a great addition to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you're invited to come back whenever
you're free.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pressure, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a busy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to our friend Vincent for the
compliments on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the show moving with another
message from our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot alike of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey Rasta Jeff, if you read this
on the podcast, you can shout out my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Victor?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been a Patreon supporter for
quite a while now and I've been listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to your podcast for even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say your lessons have helped
me as a grower and reassured me on a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of tips and advice I've already come
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes you just need
reminders and assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to remind people of the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that my lessons are matching
up with other shit that you have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you're finding it to be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says I'm very thankful for you
sharing your knowledge and improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of so many growers medicine,
especially those that need this plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use cannabis to improve the
quality of our life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's mentally, if it's physically,
if it's spiritually, as long as your life
[SPEAKER_00]: is better, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it gets to the question part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question for you is about
alternating nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few grows under my belt now and
I've always noticed the plants tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate nodes when they begin to flower,
which seems normal from what I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also noticed that my clones after a
certain amount of growth began the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of alternating their nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think he's talking about is when
you grow a lot of times when you grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, the plant will go straight up and it
will spit out a branch on the left and the
[SPEAKER_00]: right and they'll be parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple inches later, you'll get a branch
from the it's left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're going to say the up and
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at the plant from above,
it's a plus sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got north, south, east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time it'll shoot out an
east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, it'll show it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be east and west first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being hypothetical, but you'll get an
east and a west and then a north and a
[SPEAKER_00]: south and an east and west and a north and
a south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the plant straight from
above, it looks like you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: plus sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what he means by
alternating nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you grow from clone,
you will notice that sometimes the nodes
[SPEAKER_00]: will go the east node and then it'll grow
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the west node and then it'll go
up and then you get your north and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: little space and then a south.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what causes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my brain, I'm seeing the apical
meristem of a plant from the main stock of
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one grows the parallel branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches that grow off grow shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you are seeing is
alternating shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure that that's what I'm
seeing from your interpreting from your
[SPEAKER_00]: question, but that's what I think you are
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoots are alternating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches will grow side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you said that that starts to happen
with the clone after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not know what causes that
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of the north south,
you'll get a little gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat makes six spins instead of
north, south, east, west.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got their off kilter and there's
another set in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had north, south, east,
and west, you'd have one that went
[SPEAKER_00]: southeast in their southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, it would go diagonal across
and it just spins all the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes kind of a spiral staircase
looking thing if you get it really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what causes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says due to space limitations,
I keep my clones in solo cups until they
[SPEAKER_00]: reach about one to one and a half feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're giving me hints of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I clone them again to keep them
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be that the small solo cups are
triggering the clones to auto flower or is
[SPEAKER_00]: it alternating nodes on clones or is the
alternating nodes on clones a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: occurrence?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been cloning for long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my second set of clones totaling
six clone strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been fairly consistent trend in
my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also running my lights 20 hours on and
for office suggested one of your episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: to combat auto flowering tendencies and
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care and stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signed from Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Victor, this is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand what you're talking
about here in the second part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're letting the plants get too big in
those solo cups, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are too tight in those cups,
they will begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of taking clones from plants
that may have hormones that are ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones in those plants are a little
bit pissed off, freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, dude, we've been in a solo
cup for way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their shoes are way too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting angry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may be trying to flower on you
because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I would definitely, you can keep them
in the cups if that's what you want to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would give them a bigger root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep them small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep them short by topping them
and training them and pruning them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to punish them by keeping
them in cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them out of the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see much, instead of just tall,
lanky, skinny plants, if you get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cups, they'll branch out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't go up so hard if you give them
some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that doesn't sound logical,
but it is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them more space, a bigger pot,
they'll bush out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think that a plant kind of works
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have, let's think about a
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're real tall and skinny and you got
your feet together and I push you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to wobble because your
gravity is all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spread your feet and I push you,
you've got more of a chance of not falling
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant doesn't want to get too
wide because it doesn't have a big wide
[SPEAKER_00]: root base.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too tall, too wide up top,
it's going to topple over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it knows that it's like, man,
my roots are only this fucking big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better not branch out too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just keep going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're kind of punishing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not giving yourself as much success
as you could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of limiting your options by
having big, tall, lanky, stretchy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that you should up pot
them sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be talking completely irrational
bullshit right now, but that is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that maybe having those
plants in those cups for too long may be
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to a lot of your questionable
plant performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much my diagnosis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in bigger pots earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think that the hormones in the
plants won't be trying to switch over to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in the part about 24 hours,
20 hours on and four hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that will help the plants not auto
flower, but it's not going to stop them if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in too small of a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll still get mad at you and they will
still flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a follow-up to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Victor did send a second email and it
goes, Oh, also regarding clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one clone grow all weird with only
sets of three fingers on the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: super bushy and it flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kept growing in the same pattern and
was a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mess to keep under control due to
the insane amount of small branches
[SPEAKER_00]: growing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the clone during veg, but it looks
like what I've heard described as monster
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to my clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Victor, this message gives me
even more clues that your root bound
[SPEAKER_00]: clones are going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mad enough about being root bound
that they're triggering the hormones in
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think your light cycle is barely
keeping them from flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you took a clone from one of these
plants that was on the verge of flipping
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower and it rooted and it made
roots, but it had already told itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm fucking flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was stuff you did, but I mean,
it was doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you flowered it and you basically
did flower a monster cropped clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones were going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was trying to figure out life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you got weird shoots,
crazy super branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't sure what to do with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was simply trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does kind of support my idea that
your plants are getting frustrated at you
[SPEAKER_00]: for keeping them in too small of a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you could solve this issue by
simply either the first issue is to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the first solution is to go to bigger
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to reduce the amount of
plants you have to create more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't going to get super tall as
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them a bigger pot,
like I said earlier, that doesn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like it makes sense, but it really will
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll slow down the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get as tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start going wider and wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wider plants are always ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of work to make them wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really try to strain them to give them
wider bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to minimize my consumption of dabs
and drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mess up the dental work,
but my throat's burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a quick drink and we'll get
back to another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thank you for dealing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got a puffy face and a messed
up voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like the show must go on and I
was hanging out and it's a add the night
[SPEAKER_00]: to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt silly sitting here watching
cartoons thought maybe I should do a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched that, uh, the toys that made us,
uh, that was kind of cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the Ninja turtle episode since,
you know, I put out the Ninja turtle line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That show brought back some super
memories, made me a super nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remembered where I was and what grade I
was in and where I bought my set of Ninja
[SPEAKER_00]: turtle toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got all four turtles once is like
a, I did good in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got all four of the turtles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember where I bought them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember how excited I was at school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get to go home and play with my
Ninja turtles after school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all I could think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's get back into these Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I've been a long time listener and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate what you do for the
growing community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm happy to be a supporter of the
show and I look forward to every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love this one because I am
reading your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have got a light leak
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing autos for a little over
a year and I would like to try my hand at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your regular seeds for next
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person has been growing auto
flower seeds, which I have nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: against, but I do recommend trying some
regular seeds just to see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to control the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to top pop, twist, lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do all kinds of different shit
that we don't do with autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you will have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have read and I've
heard from a few sources that it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to prevent any light from
getting into the grow during lights out
[SPEAKER_00]: while growing regulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's also important when growing
autos, but I don't know if it's equally as
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I realize that keeping
light out can prevent messing up your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but to what extent do they really
have to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people tell me that they go as
far as to cover the LED on the power bar
[SPEAKER_00]: and go to big lengths to make sure zero
light never gets in during lights out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that grow outside don't get messed
up from lights with a full moon and a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend's outdoor backyard grow wasn't
ruined by car headlights that drove by
[SPEAKER_00]: once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very good supporting argument
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I fully understand what can
happen with lighting up your plants during
[SPEAKER_00]: lights out, but where's the line between
good prevention and paranoia?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my name is Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this makes it onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dig in to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know how important is total
darkness during the night cycle in a
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in an indoor environment,
the dark cycle is very critical to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interruption of dark cycles or light leaks
are the number one cause to trigger a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic or intersex trait in a
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light leaks are the number one cause for
hermaphrodites, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the number one trigger for a
problem in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, any light is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A speck of light for 30 seconds may be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put my hand over my eyes,
I want that much darkness in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to feel like somebody's got me
fucking blindfolded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feel like I'm lost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to feel like it's total pitch
black darkness, almost scary darkness in
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights are off, no matter what it
looks like outside, even if it is sunshiny
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, I better not have any light
shining through whatever I've chosen to
[SPEAKER_00]: block off the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: No light shining through any gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: No lights coming from underneath the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any lights in my grow room
during the night phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, that will lead to issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you've got light leaks,
the plants will not even flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a consultation for a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Hey bro, my plants aren't
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in flower for like six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look like they're doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went over to the grow and I looked
at the grow and I was like, your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are fully in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, my lights on 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, can you prove that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, I mean, I got a timer
and it says they go off at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in here when they go off and
I leave and I come back then I come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay in there on I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timer cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go it's daytime right now outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close the door, turn off the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turned off the lights, close the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was fucking sunshine blasting
through not just through the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing he put up on the wall to cover
the windows, but also through all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting that he ran through the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had vented hoods and there was light
coming through the duct, sunshine coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through the duct through the light shining
right onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like he had the grow lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his plants were never getting a dark
cycle because he was running that dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle at like 5pm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 5pm, it's still fucking light
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were still getting plenty of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we stay say his lights about nine
o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was getting four extra hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even know about those plants
were not going to flower until it got dark
[SPEAKER_00]: outside a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my buddy was not getting flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My client was not getting flowering plants
because of a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a major light leak, but it is why
they did not flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is what controls the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to ask, the next thing
you ask is why don't they fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a wonderful question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to think about it because I
didn't research this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't prepared, but here goes my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it puts off a spectrum
known as far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in the sky, the reflection in
the sky turns that light to far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That far red light triggers a response in
the plant, a phytochrome response in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that tells us that hey, the sun's
going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that basically tucks the plant in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like giving the plants a little bit
of night cooler, pulling the off switch
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phytochrome red makes them go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are much more put to sleep than
they are without that phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of tucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a little blanket over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a couple of ambient in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a grow room indoors, we don't get
phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are installing far red lights
in their lighting setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I can't remember the name of the
company and they didn't pay me anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are companies who are including
far red lights in their LED setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will go to sleep more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times we see the sun go down
and we get 14 hours of daylight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our plants go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because as they are setting,
as the sun sets that last couple of hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outside they're tucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, they're not tucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you interrupt them indoors,
it is the same similar intensity of light
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets to those plants as they got
during the day, during their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, oh, light bulb, light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, our plants got phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a couple of ambient in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a couple of drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking sleeping hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you shine a flashlight on them,
they go, ah, bro, add the sun all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ain't shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is the biggest light you could
ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot replicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the biggest ball of energy that
there is that I am aware of that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else is fucking aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot copy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day long when we're making grow
lights, we're trying to mimic the power of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how good your grow lights are,
you can't copy the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun shines on those plants all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting the perfect spectrum,
the most, humoles, lumens, watts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not getting watts, but it's
getting all of the measurements of light
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting soaked in them and it is
getting the perfect, perfect spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the sun, whatever you believe in,
whatever God you believe in, the sun
shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun should be high on the list of
things you appreciate because the sun is
[SPEAKER_00]: the source of life, sun and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without those, I think everything else
probably just fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are getting hit by sun all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shine some car lights on there,
the sun goes, now you got a flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the fucking sun all day and I
got a bunch of ambient and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking flashlight ain't going to wake
me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why the plants don't freak out
outdoors when you get light interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes the plants may freak out
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get small light interruptions,
but they've got to be, they probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be bigger than like a flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got a street light above
your house in your backyard, or maybe if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some sort of lighting above
you, maybe a security light, that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff can disrupt your outdoor plants,
but it's got to be close and it's got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that far red light is why we don't
have as many light leak issues outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sun and the moon, that's nature,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants know that that moon is
something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't freak out outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't freak out about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sleeping from the phytochrome and
the far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I explained that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I rambled on quite a bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank my friend Darren W for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got one more Patreon message I want
to try to read in this episode before my
[SPEAKER_00]: voice burns out completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Northern
Terps, no North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, didn't mean to fuck that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, just want to start by
saying thank you so much for all you do
[SPEAKER_00]: and your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to give you a big shout
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of the information I get
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, I was wondering
about my recirculating deep water culture
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then honestly, there are a couple of typos
here and I can't figure out exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: it says, but it goes on to say,
can I start my seedlings out the first
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks of their life using half
RO and half tap water?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about this in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why you would mix RO and tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using RO, use RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap, use tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like cleaning the floor and pissing
on half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's extreme, but I don't know why
you would clean water completely clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: then add not clean water back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use the dirty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste the time and energy halfway
cleaning it or use the fucking clean
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use half and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe it's easier to, I've got an
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a little bit easier to buffer
solutions if you mix that non pH or that
[SPEAKER_00]: non RO water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the route you're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, what do you suggest when
transplanting my seedlings for my router
[SPEAKER_00]: to cubes and rockwool cubes?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I think you had fat fingers and I
think you mistyped that one there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're trying to go from rockwool
cubes to hydroton media in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just take that rockwool cube,
fill your, you probably have a basket that
[SPEAKER_00]: hangs in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fill that basket with your hydroton
and just set that cube right inside there
[SPEAKER_00]: deep enough to where you know it's getting
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should start getting wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should start getting some roots hanging
out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, deep water culture is not my
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot about it, but you've
got that rockwool cube in a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some, the clone in the cube,
it's got some roots hanging out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put that in your basket with the
hydroton clay pellets, just make sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: low enough in there that the water is
misting and contacting the bottom of those
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, the bottom of that cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what your question
was because, man, I got nothing but love
[SPEAKER_00]: and respect, but you kind of, I think
autocorrect ruined your day on this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm running general hydroponics
and I have a full line of GH products as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as some great white bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll have great success with
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the great white, just be very
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your pH stays in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your PPMs often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that in a deep water culture
system, water will evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the water evaporates, your pH will
change and your EC will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients are not going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients will stay in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH will change and your PPMs will
rise as the water evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to check that on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the pH every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, check it every 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it when you wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it when you get home from work or
whatever you do all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that shit is in line because
very small mistakes in deep water culture
[SPEAKER_00]: can lead to very big disasters and they
change rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a warm day, you've got a lot of
bubbles going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bubble off a couple of cups of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem in that bubbling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that air in there really creates a
nice mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a lot of evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some loss, especially in a hot,
dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your water from your buckets is now up
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the humidity in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like you're off to a good
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were worrying about getting that
little baby into the cubes or into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could just kind of get the
basket, put a small layer, maybe one layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of hydroton, then put the clone in there
and then just fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kind of cover the stock,
but make sure the plant's sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't drown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't smother it because the pellets
have plenty of space in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually that thing will just
start to fill up that whole section with
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be one big basket and a bucket
filled with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some typos in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do speak Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak Dabines and Turpanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I can decipher your code.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is more to that, that I need to
decipher and reply to, please resend that
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be more than happy to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time, don't type while you're
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my buddy North North Terps,
thank you for the great message.

more while I was talking.

my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rough part is over now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extraction I heard and felt the
fucking tooth come out.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over.
