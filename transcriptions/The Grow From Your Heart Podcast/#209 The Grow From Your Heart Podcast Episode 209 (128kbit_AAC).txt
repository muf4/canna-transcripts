[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 209 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am recording on
May 18th, 2017, the day Chris Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you've already heard by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm recording on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't come out until Monday,
so you will have heard by now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Chris Cornell passed away today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about first thing,
but it was one of the first things I heard
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working and someone's like,
Hey, Chris Cornell died.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, that's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a grunge kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hitting my adolescence around the
94, 95 grunge explosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was into Nirvana and Soundgarden and all
that stuff back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Pearl Jam was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that kind of sucks that Chris
Cornell died.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me think of my friend Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray, I haven't heard from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't talked to you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should reach out and say what's up to
Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played in a band called Red Eye Blind
Fly several years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're quite a good band in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lead singer guitar player was a guy
named Ray and he was obviously inspired
[SPEAKER_02]: heavily by Chris Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a couple of Soundgarden songs and
he could really belt out that soulful
[SPEAKER_02]: white guy deep raspy Chris Cornell thing
that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really loved the way Ray did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ray, I hope you're doing well,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry that one of your heroes is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: All your heroes are dying, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting old.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of great Soundgarden songs
that I think of, but one thing that always
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks in my head is that fucking Black
Hole Sun video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never forget that Black Hole Sun
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was about 14 years old when that
came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 13, 14, maybe 15, but I was into
that shit right then and that creepy video
[SPEAKER_02]: was so damn cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never forget that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the best videos I ever saw
on MTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to Chris Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry we had to lose another legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace, my rock star friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, on the 420 episode,
which was a few episodes ago, I asked
[SPEAKER_02]: people what kind of music they enjoyed
listening to and I got a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_02]: replies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were still coming in on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody who calls themselves the
Kennerat, you can find them at
[SPEAKER_02]: TrumpsterFuego on Instagram, they said
that they are into the clash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could burn and listen on repeat for days
if we're still talking music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're still talking music.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an open-ended question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're out there and you're listening
to the podcast and you still have not
[SPEAKER_02]: replied, it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what kind of music you
listen to when you get blazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you take a fat dab, after you smoke
a blunt, after you smoke a joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: however you choose to medicate,
what do you like to listen to?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of music do you put on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a tweet at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to send me a tweet,
a twit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to send me a tweet on
the Twitter, you can email me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know what you're listening to
when you get blazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty obvious what I like to listen
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggae, fish, Grateful Dead, stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're trying to get it moving in the
grow, I'll put on some Metallica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I've been working with James a lot,
we listen to a lot of Wheeler,
[SPEAKER_02]: Walker Jr. It's funny, but it will wear on
you quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move forward with the
[SPEAKER_02]: show a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with James a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with him a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: In appearance, maybe a little Chris
Farley, but smaller in the head,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Chris Farley with a shrunken head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a fucking rude thing to say,
but it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who knows Apples would call him
Chris Farley with a shrunken head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was fucking funny, a little dry humor,
but when you're on Doug Loves Movies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to just get him in when you can,
and he seemed like a quieter, shyer kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had that quieter demeanor, so he wasn't
shooting him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toward the end of the show, he got going,
but it took him a minute to get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so Apples was there, Doug Benson
was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also another comedian known.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Chad Daniels, who was fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of a dark guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a dark, twisted personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that sort of shit, so that was
really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the Doug Loves Movies podcast live
taping, the third guest was none other
[SPEAKER_02]: than Mark Otter Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, a guy who calls himself Mark
the Otter Wahlberg was a guest on Doug
[SPEAKER_02]: Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to spill the beans for anybody else
that listens to the Doug Loves Movies
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dude dressed like Mark Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wears a wig.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wears a little Mark Wahlberg outfit and
a chain and some brand new shoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he grabs his dick a lot, and it's
fucking funny, and he nails the Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: Wahlberg accent, but honestly,
you guys, it's not fucking Mark Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anybody I said that,
but it's not Mark Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dude with a bald head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget his fucking name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to call him Mark Wahlberg
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you listen to this podcast,
that means you know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go find Doug Loves Movies and listen to
the podcast from Denver that was recorded
[SPEAKER_02]: on Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking funny, and then you'll be
addicted to another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He plays a lot of games on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're new to it, it'll take you a few
episodes to catch onto the games,
[SPEAKER_02]: but once you catch onto the games,
you'll be addicted to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll catch yourself playing those games
with your friends in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll catch yourself yelling out answers
to the games that they're playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all movie-related trivia,
so I recommend the Doug Loves Movies
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out to Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to Apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to Chad Daniels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to the person known as Mark
Wahlberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put on a hilarious show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all improv.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing planned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug has a little show planned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He asks a few questions, does some games
and shit, but other than that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just people chatting, and I laughed
my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: My date laughed her ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout-out to my friend Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baker, dude, thanks for the hospitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a great fucking time with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always good to see Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys know Baker, you know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, big shout-out to ComedyWorks for
always treating me like a king.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love going to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend you check out Comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If ComedyWorks is not near you,
go to the Comedy Club in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's an open mic in your area,
go listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go listen to the comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fucking heckle them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't interrupt them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk over them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit there, shut up, listen to comedy,
laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're done, you clap.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the next guy comes up, you clap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make him feel welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he tells jokes, you laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk over anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tip your bartender.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you do comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't buy drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy root beer and pretzels, but I tip
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, super great comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out to my date, JB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a great ass time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to the next adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I am rambly, and that's because
I've been smoking some of the high
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid full spectrum extract from our
friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was smoking some Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm actually smoking a little
bit of this Lemon Jeffrey Ambrosio,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is their line of live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked that up at Elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've talked about that in
previous podcasts, but this brings me to a
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the previous episode, I spoke about
high cannabinoid and high terpene full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of explained a little bit how
they're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't explain completely because I
wasn't aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out a friend of mine came over
and he's like, dude, I make that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of skipped a couple of steps,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He asked me not to tell you guys the steps
that he skipped because it's kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: top secret tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, nobody wanted to fucking tell me
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, this is what you missed,
but do not say that on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell you what he said,
but I gave you most of the info.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of things you're going
to have to learn for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it's on the internet, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that puts enough energy into it
and effort into it, you'll be able to find
[SPEAKER_02]: out how to do it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I wanted to mention though,
what makes high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: extract officially full spectrum extract
is two separate lab tests for it to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be qualified as full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a lab test of the starting buds
and you also need a lab test of the
[SPEAKER_02]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to explain this the best I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not make any notes on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all going to come out of the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk myself through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow me the best you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a lab test of those flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say hypothetically, they have 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll fucking throw us off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the values are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just making up values.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 22 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 57 THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we can't do odd numbers,
that's going to fuck my math up.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I told you I'd talk myself through
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 20 terpenes and 50 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we make the concentrate out of
that, the math has to transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a two and a five as your
ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those numbers have to move over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to have the same
percentages, but the ratios need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to match up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be the same fraction,
is what I guess I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ratios need to stay the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is basically how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're trying to get the full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to get all of the terpenes
and cannabinoids from that flower into
[SPEAKER_02]: that extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes it a full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have pulled the full spectrum of
cannabinoids and terpenoids and anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that is valuable medicinally, you've
pulled it all out of there and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: put that into your extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also cleaned of anything else,
of plant fats and anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lipids is what they'll call that,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tests have to match.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ratios have to be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a five and a one,
however the math works out, your next test
[SPEAKER_02]: has to be divisible by that five and that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds are gonna test lower,
obviously, because they're flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the concentrate's gonna test higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got 20% THC in your flower
and 1% terpenes, then your concentrate is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably going to have 80% THC,
and then what I do is multiply that by
[SPEAKER_02]: four, so you're gonna have 4% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The math has to multiply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the one number is multiplied by,
the other number has to be multiplied by
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I think I made sense out of
that in my own head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I made sense of that in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way to prove that it is high
cannabinoid or high terpene full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: extract, and also I've seen them combine
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks call it sauce, some folks
don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of proprietary shit that
happens in this industry, and that's this
[SPEAKER_02]: high cannabinoid full spectrum extract is
about to be the next proprietary thing
[SPEAKER_02]: like live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: When live resin got popular, people argued
that you could only make live resin in a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific machine because a certain person
invented it, and he ran it in that machine
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time, so it kinda got labeled
like the Whopper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't buy a Whopper at McDonald's,
and you can't buy a Big Mac at Burger
[SPEAKER_02]: King.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't make live resin in a sweet leaf
extractor because it only comes from an OB
[SPEAKER_02]: dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my rule, that's just what I was
taught from the person who made the OB
[SPEAKER_02]: dose and who made live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the high cannabinoid full spectrum
extract, you need the two lab tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be these new, the high
cannabinoid, the high terpene,
[SPEAKER_02]: the THCA crystals that are floating out of
it, then the different combinations of how
[SPEAKER_02]: they're putting the TERPs, the THC,
the cannabinoids, everything back
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all gonna be a bunch of different
proprietary names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this live resin that I'm smoking from
Apothecary Extracts, it is live resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they have chosen to differentiate or
delineate themselves from the market by
[SPEAKER_02]: calling it, did I use that word correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just threw that fucking out there,
I hope that went well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to separate themselves from
the market and stand out by calling it
[SPEAKER_02]: ambrosia, which is a really cool term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, when I went there the first
time, I was like, what the fuck's
[SPEAKER_02]: ambrosia?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that is, you're gonna
have to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they avoid saying it's live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's our fresh, frozen product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, is that, and you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't wanna ask, is that just live
resin, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they need something kind of like a
dick just blowing down their name,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah bro, but I named it this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've named it that to separate
themselves a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that's gonna happen in the future
here with all this science and tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are just trying to stand out,
people wanna keep the money, come in their
[SPEAKER_02]: direction by having exclusive products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, my point was, you need two lab
tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanna actually call it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that I left out a few steps
because the people that are sharing the
[SPEAKER_02]: info with me don't want me to share
everything with the whole damn world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some secrets and they wanna
keep them to themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm gonna move on from this
part and let's talk about, where are we
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's jump to this message from Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say
Kelvin's name out loud, but I just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, my friend Kelvin sent me a
Facebook message and it says, hey Jeff,
[SPEAKER_02]: great podcast Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be listening to the one you uploaded
today, hopefully tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he keeps going and then he says,
I felt dumb when he read that I take a
[SPEAKER_02]: bong hit out of my bubbler, dang.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know never to use those words together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he sent a smiley face emoji.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, we're just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you knew better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say a lot of dumb shit on this podcast,
so if you wanna just take sound bites and
[SPEAKER_02]: send them to me to pick on me,
that's fair game also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I just invited all of the
trolls by saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it, I'll make it, I'll play it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll fucking put it at the end of a show
at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut out all the dumb shit I've said and
put it in a loop to a beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll play it as like an ending
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Kelvin goes on and he says,
I wanted to ask you what is the best
[SPEAKER_02]: material to use for light reflection?
[SPEAKER_02]: At Home Depot they have PandaFilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this any better than Mylar?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna purchase this PandaFilm for my
room, but I am scared that the PandaFilm
[SPEAKER_02]: will create hotspots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks in advance for the input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I fucking hate Mylar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mylar sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mylar is hard to hang, it tears,
it doesn't stick well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, if you tape it to the wall it
shall tear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does that weird rippling thing and it
drives, I've got a head injury,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that weird rippling thing from Mylar
fucks with my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think PandaFilm is much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more reliable, it's a little
thicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go with the PandaFilm all day,
every day is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: PandaFilm, the ceiling, the walls,
and the floor tape it up real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think PandaFilm is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lasts longer, it's easier to clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much easier to put up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mylar, once you get a little rip
in it, it just rips forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think PandaFilm is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick and easy answer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I helped you out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some PandaFilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's gonna be a lot longer than the
first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to give it a quick read over,
because I'm looking to see if these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: want me to use their names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna say their name, I'll just
read their location at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna go like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an email from a listener,
and if you'd like to email me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll read your email on a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of emails here in my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of them saved, but I can
only do so much content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work a full job, I've got a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to put a lot of energy into the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get about once or twice a week that I
can dedicate time to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No excuses, but I got a roof leak,
and I sit right here when I record,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the roof leak is about two feet in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes that gets in the way until
that gets fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'm gonna read your email on a
future episode is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've sent me an email and it's got a
good question, I will read it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll try to get to it before your
garden is harvested, because some people
[SPEAKER_02]: have fucking cut down their crops since
they asked me questions, and I apologize
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna read this guy's email and quit
rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great fucking email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the great compliment to open
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he says, I often hear you invite
listeners to reach out that you enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing from us, and I actually believe
you, so here I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I believe you so much, or you believe
me so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what I meant to say was,
I mean that so much that I'm actually
[SPEAKER_02]: reading your episode, or you're,
fuck, I can't speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even gonna edit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from the dab I took right before I
hit record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant it so much that I am reading your
actual email on this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I meant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you believed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then he goes on to say, I represent
that 40s or 50s demographic who left a
[SPEAKER_02]: vibrant cannabis scene in the 80s or 90s
to grow up and become responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four years ago, I was not doing well
physically, so in a what the hell moment,
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a doctor who recommended cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: No turning back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a wonderful journey it has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost 60 pounds, made progress in a
number of areas related to health,
[SPEAKER_02]: and made additional life changes to
support the immediate benefits realized
[SPEAKER_02]: from using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this dude went to the doctor who
recommended using cannabis, and the next
[SPEAKER_02]: sentence is no turning back.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude lost 60 pounds by using cannabis
as a medicine, and he doesn't mention what
[SPEAKER_02]: his health condition was, which isn't
super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is that cannabis worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lost 60 pounds and made progress in a
number of areas related to health,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it also inspired him to make
additional life changes to support the
[SPEAKER_02]: immediate benefits realized from using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy used cannabis, felt better,
which inspired him to get even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preach, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna keep reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on to say as an avid high times
reader, starting at the age of 15,
[SPEAKER_02]: I am now living my boyhood dream,
growing and breeding legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to change pages, and then it says,
where did it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring with me 30 years of breeding and
growing experience from other disciplines,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this leads me to my question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can read almost any work on cannabis
botany and find the author lauding the
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptability of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that premise that cannabis is
radically adaptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis ruderalis is an observable
testament of that fact, yet as a growing
[SPEAKER_02]: community, and perhaps more so as
breeders, are in my estimation working
[SPEAKER_02]: against ourselves in this regard by
building almost sanitary, laboratory-like
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, it is optimal, but is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't allow the cannabis to adapt or
breed strains that adapt because the
[SPEAKER_02]: majority of folks intervene
environmentally before cannabis is ever
[SPEAKER_02]: called upon to adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you, and I've got,
I agree with you, but I'm going to argue
[SPEAKER_02]: with you just to play devil's advocate,
but I wanna continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go on to say, let me give you an
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently constructed a small,
secure greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plan was and is to install climate
control as well as an already installed
[SPEAKER_02]: light deprivation setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to change pages, so let me find
where I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in early March, I stuck a dozen
or so plants in there with no supplemental
[SPEAKER_02]: heat or light just to observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The results were mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, but surprisingly, four strains
performed quite well, including two of my
[SPEAKER_02]: homebred creations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you've read some great shit
and nice work breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several others fell extremely short of
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, we were seeing swings from
39 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and 15 to 88%
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have two plants flowering,
and yesterday, we saw 56% to 109 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit and still no signs of distress
with the remaining strain either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm impressed also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants are getting super cold at
night, and they're sweltering in the heat
[SPEAKER_02]: during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to figure out life every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of their day is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The start of their day is a struggle,
and they're not fucking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some hearty plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go on to say, clearly nobody would
recommend this environment, yet I see
[SPEAKER_02]: where tapping back into the adaptability
of cannabis can play a significant role
[SPEAKER_02]: into the development of strains that may
exceed the narrow margins of environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance that we see now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we create stable strains that
don't fall over and wilt with 60 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature swings in a four or five hour
period and still have other desirable
[SPEAKER_02]: traits we all seek in high quality
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my place again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this the very making of a superior
gene pool?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start thinking about some
monetary savings on energy, a lighter
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon footprint from our industry,
and less crop failure from some random
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment malfunction, even when we do
have an ideal environment, it seems to me
[SPEAKER_02]: we may still be a bit collectively
misguided as an industry in our breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: philosophies or inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone talks about getting back to
heirlooms and land races, and I agree that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a really good direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be at least in part because they
are much more adaptable?
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, keep rocking the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: In much respect, big Gar from NorCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gar, I hope I was supposed to say your
name, but that looks like it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: You raise a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to scroll back up and try to
answer the questions one at a time here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I do it, I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to have to deal with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about the frosty cold Dr. Pepper I'm
sipping right now, these 23 tarps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to quit rambling for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hydrate my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I said hydrate my face,
and this Dr. Pepper is not going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: shit for hydration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I meant caffeinate my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm freshly caffeinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's answer some questions here from our
friend, big Gar at NorCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first thing he mentions is that we're
using sanitary and I forgot the words that
[SPEAKER_02]: he used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanitary laboratory-like conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said, sure, it is optimal,
but is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with those conditions,
we don't allow cannabis to adapt and we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't breed strains that adapt because the
majority of the folks intervene
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key that got me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Majority of folks intervene
environmentally before cannabis is ever
[SPEAKER_02]: called upon to adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of me thinks that we are breeding
specific strains to grow in specific
[SPEAKER_02]: environments because everybody is growing
in that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think they're growing in that
environment because that's what works.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my grow, not my grow, in the grow where
I am employed, I manage the Three Rivers
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics grow in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got a whole bunch of new stuff
recently too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got about 50 strains,
I'll say, about 50 mother plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means at any one time I could be
running, I try to only run about six
[SPEAKER_02]: strains in one room, to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those strains need a little bit
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: One strain over here would like a little
more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: This strain over here would like it to be
a little bit colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't do that to all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have found is the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you understand what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just explaining this as my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to, sorry if I sound
condescending.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found the window that they prefer to be
about 70 to 75, maybe 77 degrees at the
[SPEAKER_02]: most is where all of those plants will be
happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, if I had one strain, I would dial it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfectly, and I would get that
laboratory-like condition perfect for that
[SPEAKER_02]: one strain, which is exactly against what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good part about that, and in the
industry we're in now, we can't rely on
[SPEAKER_02]: what ifs and strains that may adapt and
may pull through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't risk my multi-million dollar
facility on environmental question marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to be able to control it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that those plants are gonna
grow that way because we've bred plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that, and I know that they're gonna
grow that way at my facility here and the
[SPEAKER_02]: next facility I'm building and the
facility that I'm building after that
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're gonna set up the same
environment in all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way I know that when I take these
clones from this grow to this grow to this
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, I can set up consistent environments
and grow them all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we're doing the same
environment, the same laboratory
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, because I can't afford
environmental weather catastrophes at
[SPEAKER_02]: random, and I can't risk my plants doing
weird shit by not creating those
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need those optimal conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner of my facility, if I told him,
let's just take off the roof and rely on
[SPEAKER_02]: the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Colorado, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is May 18th, and it hailed a good four
inches of hail in Pueblo West today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like we were just getting
bombed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't even talk to each other
because the hail was so loud on the
[SPEAKER_02]: building.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the plants would be gone if we just
trusted the outdoor weather, and they
[SPEAKER_02]: would be outside right now growing
healthily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't rely on that here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we've got to use these
laboratory, sterile laboratory,
[SPEAKER_02]: boring conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are breeders in other locations
probably who are breeding things like
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself for their environment because
they don't have the grow rooms that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got, but they're not the popular breeders
around here, probably in Spain or
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere else where they're growing
outdoors, and they don't have the rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've probably bred stuff to grow better
wherever they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that most of the world does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the technology we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: They breed it to work better for them,
and then they probably find the strugglers
[SPEAKER_02]: like you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably forced to breed that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it through the season is what
makes it, so that's what breeds and what
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's survival of the fittest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how nature does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is ideal, but in this new industry,
those traits, if the plant is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: survive in super cold or super hot
conditions, hopefully that never happens
[SPEAKER_02]: in my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I've paid a lot of money to
prevent that from happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got HVAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got electricians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got plumbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got them all on call in my phone
super quickly, and they usually show up
[SPEAKER_02]: within two hours if I tell them,
hey, it's a fucking emergency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I never experience that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I'm working with is aimed at
just producing either super great flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: or a very specific cannabinoid ratio or
super hot high THC or super high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like those plants that would
struggle, would survive better in a
[SPEAKER_02]: struggle are not going to be the
connoisseur quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have super high quality cannabis
come from that struggle, but I feel that
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff that's been bred to just produce
super high THC or very specific flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to perform better in a very
controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was bred for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say I don't think you're going
to get as good quality out of that outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: struggle stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of its traits are going to be
designed at surviving, and I want traits
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't have to be so strong to survive
that they can make more flavor and more
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with you that we should be
breeding for the strength and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for my industry, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much money on the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a more reliable product for my
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clientele have higher expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they come to the store, they know
what strains our store is going to have,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they want to see those strains the
best they can be or better than last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't get as many days of the sun or
get too many cold days or too many hot
[SPEAKER_02]: days, and there are so many variables,
that plays into profit margins,
[SPEAKER_02]: that plays into customer return,
plays into satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, very small swings like that in
this industry can close a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of why people can't play like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get back to your email because I
feel like I'm really rambly today.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last paragraph of your email,
you say, when you start thinking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: monetary savings on energy, a lighter
carbon footprint from our industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and less crop failure from some random
equipment malfunction, even when we do
[SPEAKER_02]: have an ideal environment, it seems to me
we may still be a bit collectively
[SPEAKER_02]: misguided as an industry in our breeding
philosophies or inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone talks about getting back to
heirlooms and land races, and I agree that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a really good direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be at least in part because they
are much more adaptable?
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, keep rocking the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part you say right here, there are a
couple of things I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start thinking about the money
savings on energy, a lighter carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint from our industry, and less crop
failure from some random equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: malfunction, even when we do have an ideal
environment, it seems to me we may be
[SPEAKER_02]: misguided.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that the monetary savings
would be worth it if I don't have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency in my product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds like I'm nitpicking and
I'm being weird, but I've been in business
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings with operations managers and
such, and I feel that, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality is where it's at right now in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing separating us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are dispensaries wherever you are,
I can't say wherever, almost wherever you
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a city, a populated city,
there is a dispensary 15 to 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: away, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 20 choices that I could drive to
in no time at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably 10 recreational and 20 medicinal
medical marijuana dispensaries I could
[SPEAKER_02]: just drive to.
[SPEAKER_02]: What separates them?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit is pricing, I do okay
financially, so what separates them for
[SPEAKER_02]: myself is quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever's got the best is where I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't buy flour personally, I buy
concentrates, but if I were to go buy
[SPEAKER_02]: flour, I would go for the best flour,
and I feel like the indoor stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been bred for that is gonna be the best
flour available on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with you, as a breeder,
in the breeding aspect, yes, we should be
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding stuff that is more adaptable for
the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are outdoor grows here, but they are
also set up to be quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the gorilla growers are gonna be
the ones that want that outdoor stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: is still quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no hype in the land race type
stuff is also what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_02]: These new strains, they all have a name
tag on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes around the internet, it goes
around Instagram, it goes around Facebook,
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes out in a rap song, and that shit
sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want the hype, that is a lot of it,
and a lot of those strains that get the
[SPEAKER_02]: hype were bred indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few episodes ago, I mentioned that I
think a lot of Dutch breeders and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch breeding turned cannabis into a
pussy, so we are on the same page with
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but at the same time, we couldn't,
we might not have a lot of these amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors and cannabinoid-specific things if
we weren't breeding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of sacrificing the toughness
for other traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like maybe you get, if it were a
video game, you'd get 100, what are they,
[SPEAKER_02]: attribute points or whatever, and you get
to assign them however you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like if you're gonna use a lot
of them to adaptability, you may be taking
[SPEAKER_02]: attribute points away from other things
like high THC, high flavor, or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: may be that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with you in some aspects,
but as a commercial grower who has to
[SPEAKER_02]: reach goals or I don't get a paycheck,
I really rely on the breeding of strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that just rely on a very specific
environment, and then I rely on that
[SPEAKER_02]: environment being reliable and consistent
and specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a breeder, I do agree with you 100%,
we should be breeding strains to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptable, a little more vigorous,
but also I'm a weed snob, and some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite strains to smoke are a little
bitch to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've bred something that has the
desirable traits of, say, a popular
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, what's real popular without saying
one of my strains, tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've bred something that's the
quality of tangy, and I can leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: outside in the snow here in Colorado,
you're a fucking champion, and I would
[SPEAKER_02]: love some seeds or a clone, and I would
love to grow, and smoke, and breed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and work with something that you've
created that is that adaptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your main question,
yes, I do agree that creating strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: have all the desirable traits plus
adaptability is the key to making a
[SPEAKER_02]: superior gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there is no hype in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not, everyone's looking for those
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all breeding and growing it in these
perfected grow rooms, so we're not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: find that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thankful that there are guys like you
out there breeding and checking out
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely severe conditions for these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm impressed with what you did,
and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, now I've got a couple of questions
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you breeding with?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the cross that did so well in your
extreme conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have anything out there that I
may have read about or heard about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you made any crosses that have gotten
any notoriety or anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious about your breeding,
because obviously, I'm a breeding nut
[SPEAKER_02]: also, and I'm just curious what my
listeners have going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, big shout-out to Big Gare out there
in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that you sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody out there has a question,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to answer your question on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up on a future episode,
I've got kind of a lengthy episode from
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody that asks for updates about old
guests, and they ask a lot of interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: questions that I will answer on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we've got a question about wet or
dry trimming for better turps,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I've got a question about
flushing in soil and cocoa, so I will get
[SPEAKER_02]: to those on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my throat's burning out, and I'm sure
your attention deficit disorder is kicking
[SPEAKER_02]: in, so I'm going to remind you about
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you felt like this podcast was worth a
couple bucks, you can contribute to the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast by going to patreon.com slash
growfromyourheart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon will allow you as a listener to
financially contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm going to do with your
contribution is I'm going to pay for my
[SPEAKER_02]: web hosting to keep the podcast on the
website for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never want to charge you for the
podcast, but I'm sure there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: people out there that would like to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes straight to my PayPal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use my PayPal to pay my Bluehost
hosting, and that keeps the podcast up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That keeps it here for you guys for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm putting all of the older
episodes up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time this comes out, I should have
about 50 episodes posted to the YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first 19 are on an old channel,
so they're just shared as a playlist,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then 20 through whatever will be up on
the Grow From Your Heart podcast YouTube
