[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe too late for that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bunch of great emails here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's jump right
into the email portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first message came to me from I'm
looking for their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says best with best wishes from Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my buddy, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening and for supporting
and for reaching out to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting out a good vibe is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the good vibes lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much not good vibes in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to spread the best vibes I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for spreading that vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you continue that vibe throughout
the day after you hear the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you've helped me and so many
people become better grovers with your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to know we are reaching the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for reminding me that I'm
hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inspires me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That recharges me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me want to do it even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that I'm reaching somebody,
helping somebody and so many people become
[SPEAKER_00]: better growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am eternally grateful for the
education and continued inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching, bro, because I promise I
will continue to educate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inspiration goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: These types of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some inspiration in the message at
the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's more inspiration and
motivation because you've got a question
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will help keep me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is teamwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the whole community for all
the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going, because I'm obviously
high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking some lemon Jeffrey live
rosin from a Fort Collins grower who would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably rather remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may watch the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot stop talking when I smoke that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome podcast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says just a quick follow up on episode
seven hundred and twenty seven when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about integrated pest
management strategies, I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: share a factoid regarding the hop latent
viroid on a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention hop latent viroid virus that
many grows are being struck with,
[SPEAKER_00]: stricken with.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're all getting this virus
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is encouraging or encountering
this virus in a commercial grow in a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the grows in California had to
deal with this hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he says just a factoid I learned
in the cannabis regenerative conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our boys at the Cannabis
Regen conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support them if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says apparently alcohol does not kill
the hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I said was to make sure to dunk
your scissors and maybe your tools into
[SPEAKER_00]: some alcohol between plants, between rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently that's ineffective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have told you to waste a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have given you shitty advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought to the best of my knowledge that
alcohol would sterilize your scissors and
[SPEAKER_00]: kill that virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at the regenerative conference
have learned and taught us that that
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol will not kill that virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says apparently alcohol doesn't kill
HLV as a clean up strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just spreads it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says hypochlorous acid,
which is HOCI, will kill the hop latent
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something to consider when cleaning
those scissors from plants to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best wishes to all from our friend Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob, big up, big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good compliments, lots of praise,
lots of encouragement, and then a factoid
[SPEAKER_00]: and a correction in that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the good messages coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I may have been wrong when I
said that the alcohol will fix your
[SPEAKER_00]: problem or help prevent problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I remembered it when I folded
the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to refer to my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to use hypochlorous acid,
which is HOCI, that will kill the HLV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else told me that bleach would
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not testify to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know if you've got feedback,
input, constructive criticism or something
[SPEAKER_00]: to say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will bleach work to help clean up the
tools we used that may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated with hop latent viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get too sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Jack in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Jack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening down there in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we turn upside down so you can see
me properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love the Aussie support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody in Australia
who supports cannabis, supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, especially all of you rebel
growers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit and super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message, it has a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say you may have to edit this to
make this broadcastable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at editing this on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You speak stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add that Aussie accent to it,
mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, long time no
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time, first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the podcast and have learned so much
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to add the word mate in
here occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not type the word mate,
but it says thank you, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I remember you talking about
how you would teach someone to defoliate
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were teaching that, you mentioned
something along the lines of anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: a purple petiole can come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I do remember teaching,
practicing and saying on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still kind of a rule that I
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that those purple petioles
are a good indicator in the early flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room that those leaves can come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep talking about that as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I wonder if your stance has
changed or if you have more information or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you still practice this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, with the pandemic we had,
a lot of my career opportunities and
[SPEAKER_00]: career moves did change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left a lot of the commercial cultivation
consultation jobs because the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: crew went down to what I was calling a
skeleton crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lead grower and then as
minimal of a crew as they could handle in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead grower was doubling up his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the main growers were doubling up
their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took people from working eight hour
shifts to working 10 hour shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we didn't have to have as many
people coming and going from the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had the same people there all the
time to keep numbers down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that was what we were doing for the
pandemic, the lockdown, the quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that was happening, I didn't want
to be at all of these grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job is to travel from two or three
different grows a day, do one before
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch, one after lunch and then try to
squeeze another one in whenever I can
[SPEAKER_00]: during a day and go to these different
grows and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would put me in contact with a lot of
people and during the quarantine that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just chose to, I had contracts with a
lot of places and around September,
[SPEAKER_00]: October, they all expired and I did not
renew many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of things that I do on the
side, but I'm not heavily contracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not in the commercial grows as much
as I was, but I still remember that the
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation strategy, yes, anything with a
purple petiole, I do still employ the
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy of let's pull that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I teach the crew, the grow
techs, the growers in the rooms is to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read it so that I could stay on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I found this to be a pretty great
rule, but I would love you to do more,
[SPEAKER_00]: would love you to go more into removing
large amounts of fan leaves during flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps day 21, roughly for me on a flood
and drain cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells us about his grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to be the same almost no
matter how your grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to defoliate at certain
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how intensely we will
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the adjustments and the
anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then he says, uh, how about schwasing
or stripping a week three or day 21,
[SPEAKER_00]: a heavy, doing a heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, all of what you're saying makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about removing, uh,
heavy amounts of leaves since I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're right here at this point,
if you're going to heavily strip the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and defoliate a lot of plants in a
room, I'm used to working in large rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your spaces aren't probably as big as what
I'm thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to work in a space and
you're going to defoliate it, my advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do apologize for the throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked rosin on a hot nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good, but I got the throat butter,
um, the lung butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you're going to defoliate the
room and you want to defoliate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make up a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we're going to defoliate on a,
on a one to five scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hit a hard four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not start at the plant in the
corner and defoliate it to a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do everything to a level two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would come back and do
everything to a level three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then come back and do everything to a
level four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, uh, we do it in a commercial
grow this way because it takes a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: time to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got multiple dudes and dudettes and
non-binary folk in a room, defoliating
[SPEAKER_00]: their asses off all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want this section of the room to
be naked and no leaves in this room still
[SPEAKER_00]: to look like the seventies and be all
bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to kind of keep it even throughout
the room so that, uh, we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: more about, uh, micro climates and
temperature pockets and humidity pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and things in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to defoliate evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do a level one strip, a level two,
and just do it in increments instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: one section is naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: One section is really fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you did mention the word schwasing
that is right here in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily do a schwas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you almost take off every
leaf, except those two at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: you strip almost every bigger leaf with a
pedial off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is a level of five, I would say I
do about a three and a half to a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave some leaves on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the leaves do have a
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there for a reason, but I do
defoliate for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about several of the reasons
why I do choose to defoliate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the rooms and commercial environments
in Colorado, the rooms are hard to dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: large rooms and keep the, uh, the
environment, the conditions ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the environment, throughout a
large space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get the rooms somewhere between like
80 and 84 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, uh, the humidity is right for the
phase of growth in which we are in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've got a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you walk through the room,
as you go, you could feel it's more humid
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hotter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not extreme, but as a grower who can
identify that shit, you will notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by defoliating a lot of the leaves,
I can prevent a lot of the microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much, uh, is it
transpiration respiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have researched this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking really quickly also,
cause I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water coming out of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I water that room, not having so much
water in the room reduces my opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for powdery mildew in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are notorious for getting Colorado or
for getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time the, uh, the season changes
right now, we're going from the cold and
[SPEAKER_00]: wintery season into the warmer spring
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's winter one day,
summer the next, we're not going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, but that type of shit creates
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can't dial in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by taking off some of the leaf and
taking off some of the water in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help me mitigate those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, where do bugs and problems hide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the powdery mildew go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do the spider mites go on the
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take away the hotel rooms,
if we take away the empty beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nowhere for the powdery mildew,
for the spider mites, whatever other
[SPEAKER_00]: insect you may run into, there are less
places for them to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we remove the leaves from the room,
destroy the leaves, less opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: less campsites for the homeless spider
mites to chill out in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to get back to the message
because part of what you say does kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lead into more of what I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says from my own tests and seeing
others work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like an increase yields and
overall quality by improving airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improving airflow definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the plants are happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you want to be in a room?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you spread out your arms,
you touch your bros everywhere you reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get any of your own space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to open your arms
sometimes stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go to get some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take off some, off some leaves,
the leaves aren't dangling, touching each
[SPEAKER_00]: other all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also prevent heat pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says it increases a light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take off a lot of the leaves,
the lower buds will get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower buds will get more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get bigger, stronger, more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to trim up that little
larvae crap at the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, and my plant seems to focus
more on buds themselves, resulting in more
[SPEAKER_00]: dense, less leafy finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're setting yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For success, because in the end we've got
to cut all the leaves off anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we strategically start cutting those
leaves off early in flower, and as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: week by week, take off some here,
some there, some here, some there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's at the end of the season,
you don't have a bunch of dreadlocked
[SPEAKER_00]: furry leafy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got less leaf to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of your theories are accurate,
are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to defoliate about, uh,
just like you're kind of doing it here,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we move them into flower,
I will do a pop, a twist and a light
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then around day 21, another pop,
a twist and a light defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then around week six, another light pop,
twist and defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just slowly defoliate as we go and
let the plants work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, as I begin to flush,
uh, seeing a commercial grow, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: time everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a crew that is trimming,
sometimes doing other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I can get four or five
people to go into the room that's about to
[SPEAKER_00]: be harvested, I'll send them in there to
do a strategic defoliation, take off all
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves with PD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why I say this,
uh, remove the leaves with the petioles,
[SPEAKER_00]: the petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that my strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if those petioles have turned
purple, they're probably old enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: have been on that plant for the leaf to be
big enough to be blocking substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main, uh, diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main theory behind that once that,
uh, the petioles turn purple, the leaf is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably bigger than my hand, which means
it's probably big enough to block light to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably big enough to, uh,
let off enough water to create a powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely big enough for thousands
of spider mites to congregate underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw a party and reproduce under
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That purple color tells me that that leaf
is just probably old enough and big enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have simple, uh, training
techniques for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no offense to the people who work in
commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you amazing people also have one
day a week where you're too fucking high
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out your own life, which,
hey, do your thing, pimpin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get too high to handle my own
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't do it at a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you get lit up and then you go in
there and I've got to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions and crayons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, if I write down those
instructions and crayons and give somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: an objective, they'll do it like a fucking
robot all day, but you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a puppy, like their stone,
like it's their first day at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I say take off all of the big leaves
with the purple stem, they'll see the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and they'll just go start taking
off leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them confidence and then they'll
see what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say, see, like you remember how it
looked before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember how it looks now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go and take off a few more
leaves and just clean it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and do another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a training technique and easy
method of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dudes, uh, the dude, that's the
non-binary, uh, growers and grow techs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting weird in the future here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that's my way of training people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say take off the leaves with
the purple starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, uh, your, your girl scout cookies and
some of your stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soccer souffle is going to make purple
peddles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're probably going to be real
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are going to be big and
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave them on for the visual,
but I would probably take them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do, uh, probably a level one
defoliation on the first day of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a level two and a half to three
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one through five is our method here,
a five is naked and one is kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: being lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a level one on day one around day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit them with a two and a half to a
three, then around week six, I'll hit them
[SPEAKER_00]: with another level three because they've
pushed out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go past that level three,
but I'm going to get it back to the three,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it another buzz cut, make sure it's
cleaned up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do, you can go kind of extreme on
some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, however, will not recover
from overstripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some strains that when you strip
them, they stall, they just freeze up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, I'm naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants you could do it and they will
really take off and they'll really grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be strain specific
environment specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of anomalies that will
factor in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back onto the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, are there commercial examples of
heavy defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've seen some commercial facilities,
strip them totally naked to where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, if I was the director of
cultivation in that place, I'd be writing
[SPEAKER_00]: people up and we'd be taking a class and
it might be working for them, but dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: it scares me to see that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, uh, what do you do in your
garden when you're growing for flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could talk about the dangers of
overdoing it and going a bit easier and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-synthetic garden systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that synthetic and
non-synthetic really makes a difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: how much you defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more about the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment, your goal, uh, mainly the
environment and the natural leafiness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The leafiness, the natural amount of
leaves that that plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some nutrients make a lot of leaves,
not as many leaves from some newts,
[SPEAKER_00]: more newts from another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of things could factor into this
and a lot of things could factor into how
[SPEAKER_00]: many leaves you take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't take off any leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people insist that those leaves are
there as solar panels and they're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're feeding the plants into the
roots on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending a lot of money on bottled
nutrients, mixing it up, pouring it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eating from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell cause the leaf tips are
burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we don't have to worry about feeding
the plant from the leaves as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they do work as solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn if you start watching,
you'll see when you remove a leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see where, uh, the more leaves pop
up and how it moves the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to learn that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overdoing it is one of the things you
asked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe you could talk about the dangers
of overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over strip on those plants just
might not recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not spit out more leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have slowed them down,
burn them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice there is if you're going to
start, uh, schwa zing, stripping,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily defoliating new plants,
uh, if you're in control and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple plants of the same strain,
which hopefully you're running multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at the same strains, we can do an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strip one at a level one strip one at
level two strip one at level three and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue all the way till one's naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do some experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough to do a lot of
anomalies, do one a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: one extreme and see what you like better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we learn these plants,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not some sort of magical wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a ninja, but I'm not a wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't have a magic wand or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a lot of plants and I've tried
a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know what works and what
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when I do this and I do this
to plants right next to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take notes and I can see what works
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can say, shouldn't do that
again or should do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've done a lot of those
experiments, a lot of comparisons,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of tests, a lot of trials,
a lot of tribulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done full episodes about mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have killed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut down shit in the middle because I
wasn't happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've killed stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't think that I'm a fucking
perfection, a perfect grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I may be a Jedi, but I'm not a perfect
grower, but I've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a lot of things and that's how
I've learned what does and what does not
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to try different things
in different rooms at different spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to get creative and
inventive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the things that work for me
won't work for you and your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes what works for Mike at Mike's
grow or bill at Jill's grow will not work
[SPEAKER_00]: at Jack and Jill's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got different goals,
different ideas and different strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't be afraid to do some
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there, strip the shit out of one
plan, kind of defoliate one, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: leave another one alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes, see what works best
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process or repeat the
experiment for more reliable data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do Jack, let me wrap up your
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I thought it might make a good
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, I hope to hear back from you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this made a nice episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rambled on for quite a few minutes about
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said quite a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't, or did hear that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, cheers, man.
