easy for all of my friends to support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show i do want to send a big thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: to everybody who made recommendations for
new strain names that's right i am a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder if you're just watching the
podcast you maybe don't know that i am
[SPEAKER_00]: also i read genetics premium seeds i am
the head breeder the only breeder the head
[SPEAKER_00]: dude in charge at i read genetics premium
seeds that is all me 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that happens at i read genetics
premium seeds is done by me by me
[SPEAKER_00]: personally i breed the seeds i do the
selections i do most of the packaging a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the stuff happens all by me but
anyway i am also i read genetics premium
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds i'm always making new strains new
crosses new things that need new names
[SPEAKER_00]: recently i posted to instagram and i also
posted to my discord that i've got a new
[SPEAKER_00]: cross the needle needs a new name and i
got an overwhelming amount of responses
[SPEAKER_00]: big thanks to everybody who sent a
creative name suggestion if you sent one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those cliche names that has already
been taken a thousand times thanks i guess
[SPEAKER_00]: but to the people that did do some work
and sent me a creative name extra big
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks extra salute i do appreciate that i
have not decided on the name of that cross
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm not going to talk about what it is
here on the show i'm not going to talk too
[SPEAKER_00]: much about that new strain here on this
episode we'll just keep moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: because i don't want to flood the youtube
comments with name suggestions if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: on the discord in the general chat there i
did ask what the name should be so join
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord check it out there there is a
link by the way to the new discord server
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show notes and the video
description i did update and change the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord i mentioned that a couple of
episodes back maybe some people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to every episode maybe you haven't
found the link i will include the new
[SPEAKER_00]: discord link in the show notes and in the
video description please join us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: new and improved upgraded updated discord
server big shout out to my team for
[SPEAKER_00]: holding it down i'm in there i just got
done in an official i read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: discord mod meeting so we are trying to
moderate the server there trying to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: people happy keep people satisfied keep
the trolls away keep the scam artists out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the server so join us it is a very
welcoming environment i would love to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow love to hang out with you in the
voice chat in the video chat come jump
[SPEAKER_00]: into the discord where was i was talking
about strain names i'm trying to name some
[SPEAKER_00]: new strains and i've started doing a thing
when i make a new line of crosses i'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take a male plant and pollinate multiple
females then that batch of seeds will all
[SPEAKER_00]: get named kind of by the same sort of a
theme i've got some fem seeds that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out very soon they are all kind of
loosely named after fish songs i'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you noticed a lot of the grateful dead fem
maybe you didn't notice a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dead a grateful dog feminized
crosses were named after reggae artists so
[SPEAKER_00]: i tried to kind of bulk them into a group
that helps me remember what they are it
[SPEAKER_00]: helps me identify what they are also it
helps other people associate with them
[SPEAKER_00]: there was also the tmnt line we had rafael
donatello leonardo michael angelo there
[SPEAKER_00]: was shredder bebop rocksteady it made it
really easy to just say is the tmnt line
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out you knew that that was all the
reversed blueberries cross now all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish stuff is actually a reversed
afterglow cross i took the afterglow
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed that pollinated a bunch of stuff
all the things from there got named or are
[SPEAKER_00]: being named loosely named after fish songs
or fish associations we'll talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future some people will understand
what the rhombus is and some people simply
[SPEAKER_00]: will not i am rambling my point is thank
you for the help in naming strain names i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like a lot of the good shit is taken
and when people try to give me strain name
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions they say things that are
already completely taken because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: running out of all the cool shit i do
appreciate the help i feel that naming a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain can almost make or break that
strain if a a really killer strain a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good cross has um a bad name or an
unappealing or a non-desirable name people
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't buy it as much as they would a
cross with a really cool name sometimes i
[SPEAKER_00]: think i've got the greatest name ideas and
it just doesn't work uh soccer soufflé and
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine for example those are those
were made together in the same run um and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are both kind of named after tributes
to two of my favorite comedians soccer
[SPEAKER_00]: soufflé of course is a joke from tom
sagura and larry king and then the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: is burke reichers what's one of his most
popular jokes ever that's where those
[SPEAKER_00]: names came from the machine sells very
well people don't know what the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: soccer soufflé means so they just don't
buy those seeds both crosses are equally
[SPEAKER_00]: uh equally powerful equally as potent
equally they're both badass crosses i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: equally proud of both of them but since i
named one soccer soufflé i've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of that one since i named one the
machine i don't have as many seeds of that
[SPEAKER_00]: left so that is a good example of how a
strain name can make or break a cross
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst sells real well sun
kiss doesn't sell as well i think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: equally potent equally powerful plants and
seeds but because of the names they simply
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sell as much scarlet begonias uh
that's a grateful dead song i named that
[SPEAKER_00]: after a grateful dead song it doesn't sell
as well as some other things and it is i
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was really missed i think it was
slept on that one should have been more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular people didn't buy it i think
because of the name of the strain so um
[SPEAKER_00]: naming a strain can be difficult naming a
strain can make or break the strain in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion some people i had a strain called
bounty killer a long time ago and a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine didn't want to grow it because she
said the name was too aggressive and she
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to tell people she was growing
bounty killer i named that after a reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: artist named bounty killer um and i called
it bounty killer because it gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic buds the bounty was beautiful it
was a bounty killer also reggae artist
[SPEAKER_00]: influence name in there that's where that
came from anyway my main point was thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for the strain name recommendations i do
appreciate that i will post more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to social media more to the discord
also if i do ask for a strain name
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations and i can find the person
who gave me the name that i use i will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably send you a pack of seeds also i
usually don't do this this is something i
[SPEAKER_00]: should start doing i've got a name that
was given to me i posted one cross i said
[SPEAKER_00]: hey i've got this cross it needs a name
somebody shouted out a name i was like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm gonna save that for another cross i'm
not gonna use it on the one they were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about but it did get curbed and
shelved and actually i think i put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: another one already if that is now another
cross i know what it's named that goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: another pack um you'll get points for that
also when i do put that cross out i'll try
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember who said that if you remember
i'll send you a pack of those seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it super easy that way people get
treated they get a prize they get rewarded
[SPEAKER_00]: for their creative content all right i'm
rambling about strain names but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's been on my brain all day i've been
trying to name a few things i got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great fun stuff coming out make sure you
join the discord that's where they see it
[SPEAKER_00]: first all right i did say i was going to
read an email about stretchy plants i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to ramble too long maybe too
late for that if you notice me playing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the microphone i did wobble here i
apologize if i look distracted might be
[SPEAKER_00]: time to replace this mic or mic stand
anyway let's get right to this email here
[SPEAKER_00]: this one came from our friend it does not
have a name on it so we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say their name it goes a lot like this it
says what am i doing that makes my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch so much that is a common problem a
common issue it could be a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll diagnose that here based on the
evidence we are given it see it it says
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem to grow the most in week three
for me yeah that is very common um when
[SPEAKER_00]: you put your plants into flower i call it
the 21 day stretch the first three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really going to take off then
about uh the start of week four they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of calm down and start building buds
they're just trying to develop space
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting going uh that is a very
common thing but there are things we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do to prevent that to minimize that and to
keep you on track from growing those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants up into the freaking lights it says
i start them uh day one at 10 to 12 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: tall and they always end up around 36
inches or sometimes taller this week this
[SPEAKER_00]: is week four my photos are taken today he
did include a couple of photos or they did
[SPEAKER_00]: include a couple of photos it says i kept
the 600 watt hps 18 inches from the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and keep the plant short but it
made the outside edges stretch worse i
[SPEAKER_00]: think yes by looking at the photo i would
agree that the plants on the outer edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: this room did stretch worse they did not
stay compact like you would have hoped and
[SPEAKER_00]: i know why we'll talk about that it says
it is a seed run that may account for some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation but it's wedding cake not a tall
plant by any means um so you say right
[SPEAKER_00]: here that you did raise the light from the
canopy uh that is why they're stretching
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not enough light for that amount
of space they would prefer more light if
[SPEAKER_00]: you had a thousand watt in there or maybe
even a an led light with the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum they would not stretch as much so
a lot of the issue is light they want more
[SPEAKER_00]: light i see that you have got the kind of
light that has got the wing that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: bend and flex you've got it bent down to
create a very tight arc from that shield
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a reflector is what that piece is
called the umbrella piece that is making
[SPEAKER_00]: the light stay inside of that reflector
and reflect around if you can bend that
[SPEAKER_00]: out more and spread that out to get the
light you'll watch it happen as if as you
[SPEAKER_00]: lift the sides of those wings up the light
will come out to the side more and those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants on the side will receive more light
that will be the first thing i would do
[SPEAKER_00]: then i would lower that light i would
start with lowering it about six inches
[SPEAKER_00]: and if it didn't do anything good i'd go
about six more i'd watch until those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants start to look like they're almost
mad then i'd go up a little bit but i drop
[SPEAKER_00]: it down six inches right away so spread
that wing a little bit drop the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: down six inches now you're going to spread
that light more and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate a little more deeper into that
canopy the main problem is those lights
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants are not getting enough light
that is the main issue about those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that i can see um now basically plants are
going to stretch that is what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen you can minimize that by giving
them more light you can minimize that by
[SPEAKER_00]: using a trellis net to hold them down pull
them down you can use a tomato cage you
[SPEAKER_00]: could pull them into the tomato cage and
spread them underneath there and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow up you pull them under the next
level of the tomato cage kind of weave
[SPEAKER_00]: them in you could drill holes in the top
of your buckets and you could put a string
[SPEAKER_00]: on the branch and you could pull it down
and then tie it to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket i've seen that done now people are
making 3d printed plant light stress or
[SPEAKER_00]: low stress technique clips so you
basically pop the plant a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: put this clip on it and it will hold the
plant at a 90 degree or a 45 degree they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell a couple different styles it'll just
bend that plant right over for you the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will start to grow horizontal over a
couple of days it'll go straight back up
[SPEAKER_00]: then you grab it a little further down and
do it again you can manipulate the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep them low that is something that
you'll have to learn to do as a gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: once you find the phenotype which you want
to work with that's another thing that i
[SPEAKER_00]: do want to talk about here in this room
we'll get to that another thing we could
[SPEAKER_00]: do we can pop and twist these plants a
little bit something i really like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as i put the plants in flower day
one i move them to the flower room clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up the legs do a lollipop do a little
defoliation do a little uh shaving the
[SPEAKER_00]: legs some popping and twisting is the next
thing i do i talk about this a lot i
[SPEAKER_00]: simply grab the plant with two hands and i
twist different directions to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve like a knuckle popping sound i'll
do it i don't have any knuckles to pop i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: there we go you'll get that sort of a
sound when the plants make that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: sound you have now broken the cellulose
fiber of that plant don't bend it sideways
[SPEAKER_00]: don't bend it over just twist it and
you'll pop it now what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: is that plant is going to spend a lot of
its energy refocusing on that little
[SPEAKER_00]: popped and twisted part that's going to
heal that it's going to make a knuckle a
[SPEAKER_00]: knurled spot if you will that little
section will be stronger than it ever was
[SPEAKER_00]: before also it's going to support the buds
better than it would have without that but
[SPEAKER_00]: also what you're doing you're slowing down
the stretch because now the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: spending energy repairing all of those
pops and twists because i'm going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm going to start at the main stock i'm
going to go all the way up the main stock
[SPEAKER_00]: then i'm going to go each branch all the
way up and pop and twist as much as i
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can and cause a lot of its low
stress training to this plant just by
[SPEAKER_00]: popping and twisting it now it's going to
spend a lot of energy repairing and
[SPEAKER_00]: recouping all the damage that we just did
instead of growing tall it's going to just
[SPEAKER_00]: go i can't grow tall i got to fix all my
broken arms and my broken knuckles we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do a lot of serious damage to the
plant but we did enough to refocus the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy on repairing instead of growing
tall now we're not going to damage any
[SPEAKER_00]: buds any weed any flower development
because that's not even happening yet the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are still transitioning into their
flower growing hormones that's why they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to take off so rapidly there are
nutrients we can feed our plants which
[SPEAKER_00]: will mitigate that stretch maybe if you
reduce the nitrogen that will slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: that stretch i like to give my plants
shine right at the start of flower and i
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that that does reduce the stretch a
little bit there are a lot of products out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that will claim to reduce stretch do
some reading do some research but the main
[SPEAKER_00]: thing i would think about is this is plant
and phenotype specific this is your first
[SPEAKER_00]: run with these plants these came from seed
i would have flowered these much sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: i've seen your grow space and it is a
little packed in there the plants are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little stretched out they're a little tall
and we don't even know if we've got males
[SPEAKER_00]: or females or intersex plants or mutants
or keepers at this point and you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging for at least 30 probably 45 days
based on the photos that i've seen so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already 45 days into these plants
and we don't know if they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers we don't know if they're total
trash or if they're gold they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: either or you said you have got some i
think you said wedding cake that could
[SPEAKER_00]: turn out to be 100 percent intersex plants
or that could turn out to be hot hot fire
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm not sure what you've got either are
you we don't know until you flower them
[SPEAKER_00]: out finish them dry them cure them smoke
them and approve them or reject them so
[SPEAKER_00]: what i would have done is i would have
grown these much much smaller and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered them much earlier my plants would
have been about the size of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: when they are finished my test run of
plants would be as big as yours are now
[SPEAKER_00]: when they are done i would be done already
those would have been into flower i would
[SPEAKER_00]: have sex them i would have pulled out the
males i would have had them finished
[SPEAKER_00]: already we'd be drying curing them and
smoking them while you're still vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: not really you're only like 45 days in but
i'd already be a few days into flower with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are brand new i wouldn't spend
that much time lights energy electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: water soil nutrient space i wouldn't have
given them all of that without knowing if
[SPEAKER_00]: they were keeper plants so one of the
things i would have done i would have put
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants into small pots i would have
grown them out until they were six or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight inches tall then i would have put
them into flower until i can identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females i would have pulled the
males out of the room immediately then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a decision to make do you want to
revege or do you want to cut clones i
[SPEAKER_00]: would get a clone or i would dedicate to
reveging at this time right now i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: limited on numbers i would go with the
revege situation so we just move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: you can either keep flowering these plants
or you can veg them until they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit bigger and then flower them out
but once those boys are out of the room at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point i would probably just keep
flowering keep flowering them out then
[SPEAKER_00]: find the good females out of that batch
there's going to be a shitty one there's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be an amazing one there's going
to be one that tastes good there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be one that harvests heavy you've got
to find the plant out of that batch that
[SPEAKER_00]: works best for you do you want that tall
stretchy phenotype do you want that short
[SPEAKER_00]: squat phenotype do you want the one that
makes the super dense buds and tastes real
[SPEAKER_00]: good do you want the one that makes a
little fluffier buds but gets you super
[SPEAKER_00]: high there's going to be different
phenotypes to select for in there and i
[SPEAKER_00]: would have done the phenohunt before i did
the big dedicated grow which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what it looks like you did then we could
have found out does this one get tall does
[SPEAKER_00]: it get stretchy what does it do then you
can dial in your environment for the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific plant right now you got a big
jungle some plants are 18 inches tall some
[SPEAKER_00]: are 36 inches tall by the time you get
midway through flower some are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: touching the light you're going to have to
get some and bend them down you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a lot of work to do so in the
future i would recommend flowering smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: test plants don't waste a lot of time
space energy money and investment on
[SPEAKER_00]: something you don't know is going to pay
off the results the return on investment
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important especially nowadays the
cannabis is losing value electricity is
[SPEAKER_00]: going up everything costs more we've got
to pay more attention to the return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment so i think the thing to take
away from this piece is to set yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: for success before you fill that room or
even your outdoor this does apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors i've done a full episode on this
on outdoor growing before you fill your
[SPEAKER_00]: room with giant plants and grow them real
big and give them a lot of time and love
[SPEAKER_00]: let's find out are they males are they
females are they intersex are they mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you have the plant that you want to
work with let's do a proper phenol hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: let's find the plants we need then let's
repeatedly grow those let's be real
[SPEAKER_00]: careful this year not to put male plants
outdoors and ruin other people's gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: let's be real careful not to put intersex
plants outdoors this year and ruin other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's gardens let's be more selective
let's be more careful let's put plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors that we're going to enjoy smoking
all season because if you do it right
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to grow a bunch of it let's
not put some b-grade shit out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else selects that they didn't
really want that they gave to you because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was extras in their grow let's put some
good shit out there let's be more
[SPEAKER_00]: selective let's pay attention set yourself
up for success if you have the option to
[SPEAKER_00]: run that seed indoors and find if it's a
male or a female find the keepers find the
[SPEAKER_00]: best plants that is the ideal way to do it
the first time you run these plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: just the first day don't expect the
amazing outcome from the first date that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be a cash crop that's not
going to be a profitable crop you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely you'll have medicine you'll
have a product from that first run but
[SPEAKER_00]: this is your inaugural test crop this is
how a farmer finds the plant that works
[SPEAKER_00]: for them the first one is an audition the
casting couch this is tinder this is your
[SPEAKER_00]: swipe in right now you got to go on that
first date you got to find the one you
[SPEAKER_00]: like then pamper that one once you find
the one that works best for you all right
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've made my point on that part
don't put some random seed or clone
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors it could be a male it could be

[SPEAKER_00]: hard to talk I better keep moving let's
jump into this next email here for this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode all right this next question comes
from our friend Seth big shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Seth the question goes a lot like
this it says hey Rasta Jeff how are you I
[SPEAKER_00]: am great bro thank you for asking I'm
doing pretty well nice and stoned I smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: some should I even talk about that I had
some machine live batter from some friends
[SPEAKER_00]: in we can't even talk about where they are
because then you guys will bother them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would like to remain anonymous I
smoked some machine live batter and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling great thanks for asking it says I
hope all is well and I thank you for all
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do everything is I rebro and
thank you for checking on me it says at
[SPEAKER_00]: one point in my life I was a high school
biology teacher and while take while
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching things like Mandolin genetics and
plant biology I was I would always try to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell my students pay attention now because
it's free if you wait till later in life
[SPEAKER_00]: someone will make you pay for this type of
information most of the time that is true
[SPEAKER_00]: but it goes on it says thank you for
proving me wrong I love how you were
[SPEAKER_00]: providing all of this free knowledge so
that we can all learn from our hearts I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that thank you for noticing I
do try to keep the show free of course
[SPEAKER_00]: there is the patreon to where if people do
want to contribute they can so I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you noticing but I do put all
of this content out here without charging
[SPEAKER_00]: you a penny for it all right it does go on
it says I have a grow question which is
[SPEAKER_00]: great because that's what I am here for it
says I currently grow organically in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with an HLG 600 R spec then it talks about
the grow a little bit it says I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing a run of strawberry glue from th
seeds which is a seven to eight week
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering strain that I had planned on
taking out the full eight weeks which
[SPEAKER_00]: would mean harvest is in two days all
right it goes on it says I heard on your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast that for the last seven to ten
days you switch back to an 18 six light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle and I've decided to give that a try
yes many people have said that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: completely crazy for doing so but the
people that have tried this have given me
[SPEAKER_00]: great praise when I am finishing my plants
when I'm flushing I turn my lights back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 hours on and six hours off yes that is
not normally what people do but I get
[SPEAKER_00]: great results I notice my plants get
beefier and chunkier and they finish a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more quickly so that is something
I've implemented it into my grow I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: do this on the very first run I do this
after I know the plants after I know how
[SPEAKER_00]: long they flower how long I need to flush
them when they are done that is when I
[SPEAKER_00]: start doing cool fancy shit to them not on
the first run keep that in mind so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going there's more it says the
problem is that in two days I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes will be ready I thought they
would have been ready but this morning
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably only two to five percent
amber and mostly cloudy but some trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: are even still clear that is they will
speed up quite quickly they'll never be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely even completely the same it
says I feel I definitely have to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 six light cycle out to the full ten
days which would be a Tuesday harvest date
[SPEAKER_00]: my concern all right this is where we get
to the concerns is that what if the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are not ready on Tuesday which
would be the full ten days of switching
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the 18 six I think you'll be just
fine going 14 full days with 18 six light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle maybe even up to 17 days I've gone
and have not had problems this is why I
[SPEAKER_00]: always say this is why I say two things
always go always plan to go longer on your
[SPEAKER_00]: inaugural run with the pack of seeds when
you said at the beginning that this was
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be a 78 week flowering cycle
strain I was already skeptical I would
[SPEAKER_00]: already plan to go nine weeks with that I
definitely wouldn't go eight weeks I would
[SPEAKER_00]: go nine just to see then the other thing
that I would definitely not do is do the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 six on the first run so that you don't
run into this type of issue if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: have ran it and I'm not trying to to
criticize you or scold you or anything I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just saying if we would have done a run
with these plants first we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: known they definitely don't finish in
eight weeks then we would have known not
[SPEAKER_00]: to start the timer too early so then we
would have figured that out but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think you're gonna have too much of a
problem they're going to finish up on time
[SPEAKER_00]: you've still got
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of days to go plus you've got a
couple of 20 to 30 percent amber trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: do I run the risk of reveging these plants
if I have to go longer than 10 days in 18
[SPEAKER_00]: six should I switch back to 1212 no do not
switch back to 1212 that will freak them
[SPEAKER_00]: out more than anything you've already
given them a hormone shift in the I said
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone shift I apologize if he caught
that both times I said it you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: confused them that will just make them
even more confused I'll start doing wonky
[SPEAKER_00]: shit leave it on the 18 six let them
finish out if you see any signs of revenge
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll know what it looks like at the tips
of the buds they'll start doing weird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it down right then begin flushing now
be prepared to cut right away but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are going to finish up on time
in the next few days you'll notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next few days they'll just finish
up for me they're done and they're on that
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle that makes them go more
quickly they will finish up if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut down before they are 20 to 30
percent amber that will not be a big deal
[SPEAKER_00]: you will still have quality potent smoke I
don't think it's going to ruin the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: for you so pay attention see if they start
looking like they're revegging as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: you see revenge cut them also pay
attention to the trichomes I would go
[SPEAKER_00]: about 15 to 20 percent amber then I would
cut at that point but I do not think you
[SPEAKER_00]: should switch back to the 1212 now there
is a second half to this question it does
[SPEAKER_00]: go on it says my next question is about
breeding these are my favorite questions
[SPEAKER_00]: it says I'm about to become an amateur
pollen chucker and I just germinated four
[SPEAKER_00]: of your firefly seeds with the paper towel
method for the record I tried to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: six and all six showed a taproot coming
out and I planted them it talks about that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 100 germination rate it looks
like a couple of died and I'm not sure why
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't cover that it says my plan is to
get a cutting of another strain from a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and cross it with the firefly with
the dual goals of making firefly a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit shorter and to really push the skunk
nodes I know that you always seem to give
[SPEAKER_00]: permission to breed with your gear but I
at least wanted to ask permission and show
[SPEAKER_00]: you respect you deserve not to mention I
wanted to make sure that you did not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any plans to do the same cross being that
you are a professional and this is your
[SPEAKER_00]: business and I'm doing it for fun dude you
have got my full blessing everybody out
[SPEAKER_00]: there if you're listening or watching or
if somebody's reading this to you or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you've got my full permission to
breed with my seeds and my strains I did
[SPEAKER_00]: not invent cannabis I don't own weed I
don't have a copyright on seed breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not me that's not my way I make
seeds just like all the other breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds just like you're gonna make
seeds I didn't sneeze some seeds out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: ass one day and create a strain I had to
get seeds from other breeders you see me
[SPEAKER_00]: honor the breeders that I work with that's
all that I ask you to do when you do breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with my stuff if you post a picture say
this was whatever across to Rasta Jeff's
[SPEAKER_00]: firefly or firefly cross to whatever give
me some credit I would love that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all you've got to do I maybe send me some
of them I do appreciate getting seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends in my mailbox that is always
awesome but I do invite you to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding find the plants that work best
for you grow them a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: understand why I have a good goal it seems
like you do and then do your breeding bro
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart breed with love and
show me pictures of the results it says if
[SPEAKER_00]: this email makes it to the show please
don't read this sentence all right no I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't plan on working with the cross that
you're working with and I I'm not even a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of that plant no offense to it that's
just not my thing so you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: something totally different than what I
would do enjoy then it says finally do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an application to become a seed
tester I could not find one on the website
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert grower but I am not a
noob either obviously any seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me would automatically refrain from
doing any pollen chucking or anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: for that matter other than testing them I
do appreciate that thank you there is not
[SPEAKER_00]: an official tester application I have put
out an episode about testing seeds I
[SPEAKER_00]: basically ask you to watch that episode
send me an email then if you want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester you will be required to join the
new discord server and post all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: test photos on the new discord server in
the tester section that is what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you're qualified and able to do
that send me a message maybe send me a few
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of your grow just say hey these
are the pictures I could take this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do let me know that you're detail
oriented let me know your skill level and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will consider you as a tester so
send me that email I will do my best to
[SPEAKER_00]: get test seeds out and I do appreciate
that you know better than to breed with my
[SPEAKER_00]: test seeds that is always frowned upon in
the tester community I don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds are any good I don't know the
future of my new cross I hate it when
[SPEAKER_00]: people breed with shit that I send them as
testers that's not cool let me do what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do with it before other people get
out there and do their thing with it
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I trusted you with testers
anyway yes send me a message about testing
[SPEAKER_00]: send me some pictures your growth send me
some details watch the tester video I do
[SPEAKER_00]: have a few rules and a few a little bit of
criteria that I would like run them as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as possible don't share clones don't
share seeds don't share pollen don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with them until I give you a
go-ahead but yeah please do send me an
[SPEAKER_00]: application send me an email about it it
goes on it says sorry for the long email
[SPEAKER_00]: stay iry and take effect and give your mom
a hug for me cheers from your friend Seth
