[SPEAKER_03]: Bless our family.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Natalie rise and you are tuned to
the highest frequency the grow from your
[SPEAKER_03]: heart podcast with the rest of Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, big up yourself every time rusted
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the place you want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got to grow from your heart
to know from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep it locked.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grow from your heart podcast starts
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 858 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go too far, I do want to let you
know that the early pre Black Friday sale
[SPEAKER_00]: has begun at iri direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check iri direct.com for new drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new products available at iri
direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check for restocks of many of your
favorite sold out items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure you check that discounted
pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are on black Friday sale pricing
already at iri direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check iri direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Black Friday sale has begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that is all the advertising I
have to do at the start of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a website that website is iri
genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top of my website, there's a row of
tabs and one of them does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab and you
send me a good grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will read your question here on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds from iri direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question on today's podcast came
from somebody who wants to be called lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl packer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my new friend lucky bowl
packer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says this is a two part
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to send you one prize,
but I will answer both questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say how long can you use your mail
plants for that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is and or do you take
clones of him or just save the pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy lucky bowl packer before I go too
far, make sure you do check your inbox and
[SPEAKER_00]: check your spam because you've got a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: iri direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about keeping male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have made some seeds that I know are
going to be successful or I think will be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful, it would be a great
opportunity for me to be able to reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to keep a clone of my male plant
the way that I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow my male plant out just like I would
any female just like you would any female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take a couple of clones either the
top or two sides, get a couple of clones
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cloner and make sure to keep that
clone secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how long do you use your male plants
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon has been around since about
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon is nearly 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that plant for that's a male
plant that I've had for nearly 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is I have to keep normally I say
remomming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I think is re fathering King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a big bushy King Solomon plant
he grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally that plant will just become
stale and tired and exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only meant to be an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant should only be around for a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for nearly 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think eight years is the math on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every occasionally three, six,
maybe nine months, I've got to do what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call a re mom or a re father of King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go take a bunch of clones off of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put all those clones in the cloner and I
wait for one or two of them to root very
[SPEAKER_00]: solidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got that in a pot, then it will
chop down that big old version and those
[SPEAKER_00]: two clones become the new fathers or
mother plants, if you will, of that King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, I have kept that plant for
nearly 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But technically, I'm only keeping that
plant for three to six months at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: before I cut clones off of it and
regenerate it because trying to keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant or a father plant around I
was having this conversation with another
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, keeping that plant around for a
very continued time, it seems like you
[SPEAKER_00]: should just be able to lollipop it,
trim it, prune it, bonsai it, it will get
[SPEAKER_00]: stale, it'll start to get woody,
it'll get a little upset with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll take a lot of training, a lot of
pruning, a lot of adjusting, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier in my opinion, my experience,
and it saves a lot of space to just go
[SPEAKER_00]: make a new smaller mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly for genetic preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't intend to use King Solomon for a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a project, a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to get laid for an entire
year, but I do want to keep him around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mother plant or a male plant of
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep that genetic preservation by
having that plant alive in my garden at
[SPEAKER_00]: all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon is my example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you use your male plants for?
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon has been around for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made 100 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around for eight years and made
80 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That once again is another estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be hyperbole in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly serious when I say I've made 80
different crosses with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long do you use your males?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years, six months at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, do you take clones of him or just
save the pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely take clones because I like a
lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pollinate twice when I do a
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants are ready, I hit them one
good solid time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll wait about a week and hit them
one more good solid time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I'm certain that those plants
definitely got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole room is dusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do save pollen, but I rarely use the
stored pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that is just an emergency
backup supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer plant to plant contact when it's
my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a lot of stored pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried that once or twice and the
results are minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get way more seeds off of taking that
reversed plant or the male plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in the room and just actually
touching the female plants with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: rubbing it right up against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did when I took female pollen or
reversed pollen and went in the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on the plants manually or blew it
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got much more success touching the
plants with the actual pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you keep your male plants for
and do you take clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I prefer to keep a clone,
keep a father plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I've said, King Solomon has been
around for eight years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper male has been around
for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BC Lemon Skunk has been around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Chocolo male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the males stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I re-mom the entire room,
those are just part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get re-fathered, I guess,
is what you will call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Lucky Bowl Packer,
thank you for the good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got the podcast off to a good
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read direct dot com and also check your
spam because a lot of times those messages
[SPEAKER_00]: go directly to that spam folder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if I have read your
question here on a podcast and I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: sent you that coupon code, please do send
me a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they I don't know what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting lost in the ether somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just send me a reminder and I will
make sure that you do get those coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sent some that are not making it to
the people that deserve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please gently remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blowing you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a little bit busy, but I will get you
that coupon code, even if the Internet is
[SPEAKER_00]: working against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of energy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the podcast where I do
remind you to click like and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoy this podcast, go ahead,
click like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're early in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, click like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good show all the way through
and then click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't miss any of my amazing
educational cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question also did come from the grow
help tab on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my new friend Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, Aaron, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo, I was wondering, since you
say you chop the dudes after you
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate, can you keep the male plant and
revege them like females?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was talking about pollinating room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've used that male plant twice or
that reversed female twice, I'll apply
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it develop more pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't actually cut the tops and the
branches off the plant and walk around and
[SPEAKER_00]: rub those all over the room, smack those
on the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you hit the fan,
the pollen goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will chop down that male plant and
completely dispose of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the clone in the other room as a
preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now at that point, that flowering male
is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been murdered.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the graveyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this question is, can you revege them
like females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it is a real pain in the
ass to revege a male ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you, just like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you activate that process of setting
off that activity, it really wants to set
[SPEAKER_00]: off that activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot to cool him down,
restart him, get him back into the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen, but it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, probably twice as long as it
does a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get that clone and make that
clone be your preservation, that's a much
[SPEAKER_00]: more viable opportunity, a viable
situation than trying to revege your male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a really long time and it takes a
lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, once you've initiated
the launch process, that rocket wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can revege the male, but it takes a
lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to put it into a
bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to feed it a lot of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure it's not root bound at
all and give it a lot of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a room full of plants,
put the revege plant, the one directly
[SPEAKER_00]: under that light source so it's getting as
much light as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to contribute and
encourage that revege is the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, can you keep a male
plant and revege him like females?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, but it is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got another opportunity to keep
that male, to preserve that male,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would strongly recommend using the other
option, the other opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some good energy and some good
momentum moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not slow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear about pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is about feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question also came from the grow help
tab on iregenetics.com, which means my new
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Budwin Jones has won themselves a
free pack of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budwin, make sure you check your inbox and
check your spam because you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question from my new friend Budwin
goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, first and
foremost, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your content that first got me to
grow and produce my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start a message to
me with a big thank you, a compliment and
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me that I got you growing and
producing your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
for the great update.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bro, thank you for using my
encouragement to do something completely
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now self-sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow cannabis for your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can provide other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you're making your own seeds,
which to me, that's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you taking what I've
taught you, what I've shared with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually putting it to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me proud of me and you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I'm having great success based
on the advice and lessons you gave me,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just with my plants, but also how I
deal with situations in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that I gave so much life
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to say be a good person and
don't stress over dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really all we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be good and don't let dumb shit get
to you and don't let dumb shit suck you
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't charge anything for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the podcast for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have paid advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These types of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the stuff that this is the reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys saying I'm self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing because of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making my own seeds and I am dealing
with situations in life better because of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is better than currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit that keeps me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I just got fired up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got fired up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a whole new fucking brand of
motivation just fed into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says big up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does say my question is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an ideal controlled environment and
a stable STS recipe that I spray on nodes
[SPEAKER_00]: every four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already see a problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have successful reversals,
but sometimes my pollen is sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that that does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, am I doing something wrong and
how long into flower should I spray a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a full episode on this,
but we could just touch quickly on this
[SPEAKER_00]: and correct the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on this called
my STS mix, where I talk about how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I talk about application dilution
rates and talk about all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a couple of things that jumped
out to me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you said was you spray on
the nodes every four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray every three days and I spray the
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray the leaves, the branches,
the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I coat that entire plant in STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want as much silver in that plant as I
can get within reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying you spray every four days
on the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do every three days and I would do
it on the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it says I have successful
reversals, but sometimes my pollen is
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just needs to be adjustments,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the strength of your STS
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too weak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those things can cause sterile
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do it is to adjust the STS
in multiple ways and apply it to different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or the same plant, but multiple
clones and see which one works best is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a phenol hunt, your STS
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recommend and also I think my recipe
may be on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not on Discord, I will put the STS
recipe up on my Discord server so you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: can get some advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I would do it though,
I would start off with a 10% dilution of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting the silver, you're putting
the sodium in the different containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're mixing those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do one part that and nine parts
distilled water to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're at a one to nine ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10% silver ratio to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would apply, I would spray one week
before I put that female plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give it a good solid spray one week
before you intend to put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then spray it on day one, three,
six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a longer flowering
cultivar or a stubborn cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it again on that 24th day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like a 12 or 13 week flowering
sativa, give it one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to really remind it, hey bitch,
I need you to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those longer flowering sativas,
if you stop spraying and let this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, it will come out of the reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will undo the reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go back into forward gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know the word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will unreverse itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will, all plants will do that
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more stubborn plants will do that
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I do three, six,
nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, maybe 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's Congo ripper or a haze,
do that 27th and maybe even day 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't need to go that far with
most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to day 24, 21 is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your dilution is going to be very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that nine to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want a seven to three ratio,
a 70% water, 30% silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: solution dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about figuring out what each
plant wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way, like I said,
to do that is get five clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuck with them different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them with different, do 10,
20, 30 on different plants and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part I can guarantee you to do
that is standard operating procedure is to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it one week before you put it into
flower, wait, and then on day one,
[SPEAKER_00]: begin your new flowering cycle and begin
that new spray regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, three, six, nine,
all the way up to day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see pollen in most cases
between day 25 and day 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not seeing pollen sacks within a
few weeks, a couple of weeks of spraying,
[SPEAKER_00]: something is going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that the sterile pollen
is related to over or under spraying with
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the amount of the solution
is what I think is contributing to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall SOP will make a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix it up right, get a 10, a 20,
and a 30, or just do a 10 and a 30% and
[SPEAKER_00]: test two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a test run and see which one reverses
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whichever one works better,
do that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that your new standard operating
procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the golden goat likes one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry cookies likes another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other products out there that
work with one application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other products out there that
work with multiple applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use the silver
thiosulfate, stick with my standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me know what my adjustments do to
your recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, does not work,
I will help you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly just ordered yesterday,
ordered more silver, more sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered more big beakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all brand new mixing shit coming so
I can make more batches of STS because
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got more reversals coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make some more feminized
seeds very soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to tell you what we're going to
put in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that the pollen donor will
be GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for more details on that
reversal project that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, Budwin Jones, I think I really
answered your question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to correct the solution to the
right dilution, which I know just sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm talking technical jargon here,
but we do need the right dilution,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right ratio, and then apply at the
correct intervals, which is soak the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hit the leaves, the branches,
the intersections, get the entire plant
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you spray every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, make sure you check
your inbox because you've got that coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code for a free pack of seeds from
IriDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, boys and girls, we have time
for one more good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question also came from that Grow
Help tab on IriDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend, Matt E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt E., make sure you check your inbox
and your spam folder because like I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, you've got a coupon code for a
free pack of seeds at IriDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, am I harming my
plants at all by sometimes turning the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights off an hour early during flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I run my house on solar with a battery
backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking smart, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says on a low solar production
day, I will turn the lights out early to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid depleting my batteries and having to
buy power from the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually it's on 1212, but I will
occasionally be on 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote one note on my page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, they would prefer a more
consistent schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not causing any damage,
but I think consistency will really help
[SPEAKER_00]: out with a lot of things with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main, just right away, pick one,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to dance back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1113 has its pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212 has its pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you may be beneficial to do
the 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save that extra hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Save that extra hour and you will see what
we notice when we do the 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have noticed is I see more
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm growing from seed and I want to
see the differences, how those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: represent themselves in that room,
I will see the different phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: expression by reducing the light for that
one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra hour of darkness really just
lets them show their own character,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own personal traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an advantage to the 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have to run your air
conditioner, your fan, your whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shuts off one hour earlier
over the course of a 65 day flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 65 hours of electricity that
you're saving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would say just kick it off that
one extra hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do preach the extra lighting at the end
of flower because I think light is the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one source of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is situational.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this situation, I think it applies
to go 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever be afraid to change shit,
do shit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make things work for the environment,
the situation, the room, the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: the electrical grid which you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a very good time,
very good reason to switch to that 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that way you don't have to buy power
from Babylon, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Babylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck paying for electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switch to that 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become self-sufficient and don't give them
your hard-earned money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, check your inbox because you've got
a coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful
