[SPEAKER_00]: would be delighted to help you out with
your questions my email address is grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com and i do
look forward to hearing from you the email
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got in my hand goes just like this it
starts off with feel free to use my name
[SPEAKER_00]: this one comes from my new friend david
what's up david thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful email the message goes like this
i have recently received a six by six tent
[SPEAKER_00]: with two 600 watt closed hood lights with
dimmable metal halide hps ballasts so far
[SPEAKER_00]: we're off to a good start we got 1200
watts and a six by six that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more than enough i think this
will work well the tent is six by six and
[SPEAKER_00]: has two six inch fans to clip on the poles
and two six inch inline fans and a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter that is a great setup i know
exactly what to do with this i can get you
[SPEAKER_00]: going it says it has been a while since
i've ran hps as i flower with leds now and
[SPEAKER_00]: i only veg under metal halides and hps i
would like to use this new setup as a
[SPEAKER_00]: second flower room all right that makes
sense there's a few things we can skip
[SPEAKER_00]: here in this we don't need to read all of
this here's the part we need to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: it says however i was wondering most
obviously how to set everything up inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent as to not have it collapse under
the weight of the equipment and if the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballast should be outside of the tent for
heat issues also best practices preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: the filter through hoods then out of the
room if i should have the fan outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent or inside because again weight
issues are real i do appreciate all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: love good vibes and knowledge you spread
then they signed it respect rasta from
[SPEAKER_00]: david hey david this is a great email i
started off my grow career in tents well
[SPEAKER_00]: when i got serious about growing i started
buying tents before i had we all had those
[SPEAKER_00]: little rooms that you just kind of hung up
a light and wished for the best when i
[SPEAKER_00]: really thought i'm going to make this
happen one of my first investments was a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent and then i got really good at growing
in tents and i set up a bunch of tents for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and friends all over this town we
were all growing in nice five by five and
[SPEAKER_00]: four by eight tents all over i've got a
lot of experience in this let's talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about setting up your tent i
like that you included the equipment list
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it very easy for me i know that
i'm working with a six by six tent i know
[SPEAKER_00]: that i've got two 600 watt lights i know
we've got two blowers we've probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: some ducting we've got a couple of fans
which are just small accessories to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with it sounds like we've got a nice setup
the main thing i would start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about is can the room in which you intend
to set this tent up provide enough
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity to run two 600 watt lights and
all of the accessories safely i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of ballast you're using i don't
know if they're magnetic i don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're digital i don't know what else is
in the room i don't know if this is in a
[SPEAKER_00]: house i don't know if this is in a
warehouse i don't know if this is in a
[SPEAKER_00]: really old house or a modern house i would
start by doing a safety inspection on my
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity i would make sure that the
plugins in the wall are up to today's
[SPEAKER_00]: modern standards i would make sure that
all of the wiring is up to today's I would
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that the breaker box and all of
the breakers are up to code and up to
[SPEAKER_00]: today's modern standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many old houses will have old sockets,
old plugins, old wiring and old breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those old houses will probably handle a
600 with no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those old houses may not be able to run
two 600 watt lights in one room from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to do some electrical
modification or some electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do that, make sure it is done
by somebody who is qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't burn down your house in the
name of growing ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't do that to the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't do that to the whole cannabis
legalization scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know sometimes I get excessive when
it comes to talking about safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but I really don't want you to
burn down your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to burn down the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to hurt anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be responsible cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be responsible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be a responsible educator and
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first piece of advice is to make
sure that the place in which you intend to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug in these two 600 watt ballasts can
handle that much electricity safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 watts of light in that six by six tent
will be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1200 would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 will get you by and your plants will
be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would much rather see you run one 600
watt light and not burn down the house
[SPEAKER_00]: than try to push two 600s and possibly
burn down an old house.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will move forward and I'll quit talking
about the safety part because you've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to either heed my advice or
you're going to do your own thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got freedom to do whatever you want
because America and you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do raise a really good question with
this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they sell us those tents and they
recommend where to install everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a real prayer hoping that everything
stays where you put it without that flimsy
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum tubing just collapsing on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even more stressful once you've
got plants that are growing in there every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets more stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, if this thing falls over
now, I've crushed 10 weeks worth of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does become stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to hang too many things from
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you those two or four poles that
go across the ceiling that you're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to mount your shit to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust that very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do agree with you that it can be very
stressful trying to mount everything in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent sufficiently and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a few options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two vented hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also got two six inch inline
blowers, but you have only got one carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a very good setup idea for
this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work if you choose to run one or
two of those vented hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have completely agreed with you
that it is sketchy hanging a lot of items,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of equipment from the top of that
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this setup, we are only going to
hang the one or two grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever you choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're listening out there and
you're setting up a tent, this will work
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully for you with one or two grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of focus the lesson on
one light, and then I'll just briefly talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about where to add the second light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically just a piece of ducting and
you continue the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is exactly how I set up my tents
in a small room if I have got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers and a carbon filter and ducted
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got one blower,
we will talk about a different option for
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little further in the lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: This setup is going to focus on two six
inch blowers, a vented light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say vented light, let me talk
about that for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a grow light that's got
an input for a duct on one side and an
[SPEAKER_00]: output for a duct on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then underneath where the bulb goes,
there's a piece of glass in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your bulb is basically kept inside of a
box, which is sealed with that piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that allows the light to illuminate
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the heat is moved away from that
light, away from the grow area by using
[SPEAKER_00]: the blowers, which we were talking about,
the six inch inline fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hooks up to ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn that blower on, it blows air
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the heat from that light bulb gets
removed from your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier to cool the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to that is you lose a small
percentage of your light power because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that glass between the bulb and the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've also got to make sure to keep
that glass clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some environments, this is an ideal
setup in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got the two blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the two vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the two standard lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the two clip on fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was agreeing that I don't want to
hang too many items, too many heavy units
[SPEAKER_00]: from that top bar of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a perfect world, we would mount that
carbon filter and blower at the very top
[SPEAKER_00]: dead center of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have that option because I
don't trust the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a tent environment, I'm going to
recommend that we set the carbon filter in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the back corners off of the floor
on either a cinder block or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: crate or something like that, just to lift
it up off the ground just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know you're already thinking that's
going to take up some of the real estate
[SPEAKER_00]: in your tent, but it is worth every inch
of space that it takes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure the air leaving our
grow environment does not get us in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a carbon filter really doesn't take up
that much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push it into the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it crammed into the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sucking all the humidity,
all the stale air right out of that tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing it out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not snitching on you while it
does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just put it in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to set it on a cinder block or on a
crate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to get it up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can make some sort of a stand or
something for it and get it higher and
[SPEAKER_00]: higher up off the ground, that is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like to hang it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely correct in the idea of
not wanting to hang that heavy carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter and blower from the ceiling of that
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a cinder block, maybe two cinder
blocks, set them in the back left corner
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grow, maybe the back right corner
of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where the exit duct is on the
top of your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which brand you bought,
but put that carbon filter right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: very back corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then set the blower directly on top of the
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're off to a really good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are almost done with setting up the
carbon filter and that blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to run ducting from the
blower out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go through that exit hole at the very
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have a six inch hole right at
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right out of that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then continue that ducting and run it
wherever you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To efficiently get that air away from your
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that heat rises, so keep that
duct up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be dispersing the hot air up high
wherever it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to keep it in the same
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll keep that hot air up high and the
tent will bring in the fresh air through
[SPEAKER_00]: the passive vents at the bottom and you'll
get that fresh cool air on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I set up a tent in my spare bedroom in
my house, my normal air in my house will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that tent cool if I vent it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I point the end of that ducting right
out of that room and it's blowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: heat into the rest of the house to where
it could just be dispersed into the house
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of circulate and cycle and become
part of the regular atmosphere of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, the central air will cool that air
and the central air also blows fresh air
[SPEAKER_00]: into that bedroom or I've got that grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a little bit of thinking and
proper circulation, I can keep the house
[SPEAKER_00]: and the grow room very comfortable without
any extra strain on my HVAC system or
[SPEAKER_00]: without any weird adjustments to my daily
life in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got two blowers and a car
filter, it is really easy to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter on some sort of a shelf,
just get it up off the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the back corner of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got carbon filter,
put the blower on there, put a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: duct tape between them so you make a nice
seal, put ducting on there, put plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: duct tape on there, a nice seal on that so
you don't get any air leakage,
[SPEAKER_00]: then run that ducting wherever you need it
to get it away from that tent or away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point, all of the air leaving
your grow tent should be passing through
[SPEAKER_00]: that carbon filter and should be odor free
and you should be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about how to set up the
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main option for hanging the grow
lights is to use those provided bars and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang them from the ceiling just like
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to hang much more than a grow
light from that top bar, but let's go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and hang the grow lights from the
top as recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use some sort of height
adjustable light hanger, something like a
[SPEAKER_00]: yo-yo or whatever is available at your
local grow store because I like to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust that light very easily without
any stress on my body and without risking
[SPEAKER_00]: causing any problems in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend one of those ratchet style
light mover hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will make your life much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang the light, install the bulb,
don't leave any fingerprints or hand marks
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were screwing the bulb into your
reflector, I recommend wearing a rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: glove or even one of those felty gloves so
that you don't leave any marks on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you were done, I also recommend
wiping that bulb off with a paper towel or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't leave any fingerprints on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good for your bulb and it's
very easy to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's clean off the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are potentially going to hang two
lights in this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hang both of them up if that is
what you choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got two lights hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any ducting on there,
but we've got the bulbs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to install that ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to think about which
direction you need to move the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that air need to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you getting it out of that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it go once it leaves the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run that duct to where your goal
destination for that air is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to dump it right by the
doorway so that it could cycle out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: room into the other room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to run it just to the
opposite side of the room, far away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent and hope that it works that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: It possibly will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is the time to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that ducting there, then run it to
your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the tops of the tents, there is an
in and an out on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't come from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're toward the top of the tent on the
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most tents have these ducts in and out for
this exact purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to run a length of ducting in
one side of the tent and we will attach
[SPEAKER_00]: that to one of your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a piece of duct tape and I
also recommend a hose clamp around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to run another piece of
ducting from the other side of that light
[SPEAKER_00]: to the other light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now make a nice little bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make a nice sharp angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make kind of a curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more of a curve you can make,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a super sharp angle that
lessens the efficiency of your blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want a nice curve and we need to
attach that ducting securely to our second
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got ducting running from
essentially your exit point into the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to the first light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then off of the other side of that light,
you've got ducting attaching that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the obvious next step in this chain is
to run ducting off of light number two and
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that vent on the other side of the
tent, whichever side you went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another exit port on the other
side of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it right through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now created a tunnel that goes in
one side of the tent over light number
[SPEAKER_00]: one, over light number two and out of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the air that travels through
that tunnel never makes it into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we move that heat and that air
away from the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that second six inch blower that we
spoke of earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can attach your second six inch inline
fan to that ducting outside of the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can either hang that six inch
inline fan from the ceiling or you can set
[SPEAKER_00]: it on a cinder block on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point of that fan is to blow air
through the ducting over the lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you were doing is moving that heat
away from the grow tent and away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about that air
being filtered because that air never
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in contact with your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simply blowing through a tube
that goes right through the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a little subway tunnel that
just runs right through the city of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't interact with the grow in any
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own little air chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will need to run that end ducting
to your exit point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you need to get rid of that heat,
wherever you're running that other duct,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend running them right to
the same point and get that stale stagnant
[SPEAKER_00]: air and that grow light heat right away
from your grow tent as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sounded too simple in my mind when
I said it, so I'm going to recap to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we got it correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first blower and carbon filter will
simply set on the floor or on a shelf in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back corner of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the blower on top of that
pointing to where it is sucking the air
[SPEAKER_00]: through the filter and up to the ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run that ducting out of the ceiling of
the grow tent and now your filtered air,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stale, humid air is leaving that grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you run that ducting wherever that
needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbon filter and that blower
creating that suction will result in fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: air coming in through the passive vents in
the bottom of your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are getting rid of stale air,
we're getting rid of humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're also replacing that with fresh
air and the aroma of cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_00]: escaping the tent if we zip it up
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have installed the two lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging in the middle of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have run ducting into the tent to the
first light, out of the end of the second
[SPEAKER_00]: light, into the end of light number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then out of light number two, we have ran
ducting going all the way out of the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to our second six inch inline
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set that six inch inline fan to
push or pull that air over the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever way you prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any science to back it up,
but in my experience, I think that those
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers, those inline fans are more
efficient at pulling air than they are
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got more suction power than
blowing power in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply run that ducting through the
tent, through the lights and right back
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it is sealed at every
opportunity for air to leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to seal that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you seal everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got your blower pulling air
across those lights and it is sucking air
[SPEAKER_00]: this way, you have got the opportunity to
suck aroma up through the lights and then
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that ducting if it is not sealed
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you seal everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it's more efficient to
suck the air, you may want to push it
[SPEAKER_00]: because that way you're pushing air and if
you have any leaks, the leak key air will
[SPEAKER_00]: leak into your grow tent and you won't be
pushing odoriferous air out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be a safety factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't seal it up all the way,
push the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the aroma gets left into the tent
and it doesn't sneak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a blower and then you've got
some other things with gaps in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: you are sucking, you can pull air through
the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're not putting a filter on
this blower, we can't pull any air through
[SPEAKER_00]: our gaps because that air will have
cannabis aroma through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're sucking, we've got the
opportunity to pull unfiltered air from
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow tent and expel that into the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are pushing any leaks, you'll
actually be pushing the fresh air from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the grow into your grow tent
and you may get some of that heat from the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light, but you won't be blasting
cannabis scented air out for everybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighborhood to smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the chain of airflow and
make sure that everything is sealed so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't get any aroma leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it so you can't see if it's
happening and you've been around those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants so often that you probably don't
smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful and seal it up so that
nobody else gets the opportunity to smell
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it a lot and this is a good
opportunity to remember to set yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the same setup but
with just one blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have two blowers,
maybe it doesn't fit the budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you didn't score two blowers in your
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do the same setup but with only one
six inch inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start off with the very
same theory with the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to hang that heavy filter
from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to break our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to break the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put the carbon filter on a couple
of cinder blocks or on a couple of milk
[SPEAKER_00]: crates on the floor in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take up a little bit of space but
not enough to make me complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very well worth the space in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got the carbon filter set on our
makeshift shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using a cinder
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've built an actual
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you went and bought a fancy table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're doing but we've
got the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got the blower sitting on top of
the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a ring of tape around that to seal
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have got the blower pointed
the right direction so the air is being
[SPEAKER_00]: sucked through the carbon filter then out
of the blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to attach ducting to
that blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ducting is going to run directly to
our lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two lights it should be
fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go carbon filter, blower, ducting into
light number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will come out of light number one into
light number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will come out of light number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will take ducting and you can
either run it out of the top like the
[SPEAKER_00]: chimney or you can run it out of one of
those top side vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever works best for your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever makes you comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever looks best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is most aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as that ducting is running out of
your grow tent and it extends away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent to get that light heat and also
the humidity and stale air away from your
[SPEAKER_00]: tent it will work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run that ducting right to the edge of
that room right to the door and point it
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the door so as you walk in you
get a little blast of warm air on your
[SPEAKER_00]: forehead but then it goes away immediately
and once you're in the room you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that there is heat or humidity in
there because I've removed it with that
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very affordable and very
efficient way to duct and cool your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent all in one move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll repeat it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing carbon filter then the blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blower is sucking the air through the
filter and pushing it through the duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that air goes through light number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got light number two it goes
through light number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have light number two skip
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't add the second light and the
second piece of ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be really obvious for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we come out of light number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we've got to do now is run ducting to
wherever we want that air to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the final destination of that
air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we want to dump it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run it to the top corner of
that bedroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run it out of the bedroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to cut a hole in the wall and
run it right into the attic?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is safe to dump that air wherever you
need because it will not smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because it has gone through your
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you seal up all of the
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you seal up every duct joint
between the lights and the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every opportunity for a leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please put some duct tape on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do keep in mind that this air may be warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run it over the grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have two 600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have multiple thousand watt lights
if you're doing multiple tents or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done this in a large room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the air is going to be
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to run this air outside,
think about that air being warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may realize you've got some
inappropriately weird air coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your house at a weird random spot all year
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it snows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the back of your house has just
one little three by three section where
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're telling everybody there's some
weird shit happening here in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't stink but that air will be
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I went over both of those
setups quite quickly so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: reiterate the one blower style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is basically carbon filter,
blower, ducting, light out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the ducting where you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stoner and you will
succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the time we are really
trying to over complicate growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the other
accessories that you have got to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two small clip on fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're small clip on fans,
I think the tent will do just fine
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting those fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clip those wherever you feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like one about canopy high right
at the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I'll put one about the
light height just to move the heat away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two, you can experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move them as you feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put some sort of a monitor in there
and check out the VPD and get the fans
[SPEAKER_00]: moving to keep that VPD in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of your major questions was where
do I put the ballasts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely recommend those
ballasts do not go inside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ballasts are going to create a lot
of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to fight that heat inside
of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success by putting
them outside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add more heat in that environment
than you've already got from the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more detail we should talk
about when it comes to setting up a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we run all of this ducting over our
vented lights, we create a great
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will say these tents are
sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't get any light leaks in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are using ducting that is
reflective on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why the companies that make
the ducting for hydroponic use insist on
[SPEAKER_00]: making it reflective on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be much better if it were flat
black and did not reflect light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen in many situations is
light will get up into the ducting and
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect all the way through that ducting
and shine through your light hoods just
[SPEAKER_00]: like you've got a light on in your grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check that the light is
not reflecting down your ducting through
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights and into your plants when you
think the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are getting light when you
think they're dark, they might not go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think they've been in 1212,
but since you've got that light on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom all day, they've never gone into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been getting 24 hours of light and
you're way off schedule now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you may be going in there just
occasionally and flipping on the light
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're playing video games for a
couple hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you turn it off and leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you go in there and read a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just go and hang out and fucking
smoke a bowl in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you turn off the lights and
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light cycle in your grow tent just
got interrupted because it was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend that you go in that tent
before you put plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn on the lights in the room in which
the tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go in the tent with no lights and
hang out and see if you can see any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face at all in the dark, it is not dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make it completely dark in
that grow tent when it is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure no light is coming through
your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another spot where people often get light
leaks is from the passive intake vents on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: On most of the tents, there is basically a
small mesh window at the bottom with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little flap that you can Velcro and roll
it up or let it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of just works like a little shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people like to roll that up or lift
that up and let some air flow into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not lift those things all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave them about 50% Velcro to where
they can't flap up, but some air can flow
[SPEAKER_00]: through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a six inch inline fan sucking
air out of that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you close the zipper and close most of
those passive vents, you will notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: your tent wants to cave in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sucking in on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inline fan will create enough
pressure that you will get air coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: through the gaps in the fabric,
through the gaps in your zipper,
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of the little tiny holes in
that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will replace all of the air that goes
out of that blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to lift up those passive
flaps all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will suck enough air through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air travels through the path of least
resistance and physics dictates that all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the air that comes in has to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the air that goes out has to come
back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So power that blower up and roll those
vents down and just let the walls of that
[SPEAKER_00]: tent suck in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you'll get any light
leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think you will get plenty of air
exchange if you're running that six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: inline fan like my new friend David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I've seen people do is
simply make a little bit of a shade cloth
[SPEAKER_00]: on the outside of those tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen guys buy those strips of HEPA
filters and just duct tape that over those
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps to keep out extra light and it
also works as an extra layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that those vents down there
at the bottom, they'll get kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get a bunch of dog hair if you've
got a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a bunch of hippie hair if you
got a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a bunch of dust bunnies and crap
built up along the bottom of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you dust that off and clean it
up more than occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to that about once a week or it'll
really start to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got light leaks,
I recommend just roll those flaps down and
[SPEAKER_00]: only do half the Velcro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they'll be able to lift up
halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll let air in, but they won't let any
light in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't feel comfortable with
that, put something over the outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a black sheet, a black cloth,
or I've seen guys use those long strips of
[SPEAKER_00]: HEPA filters and you just put some duct
tape on the outside of it and tape it
[SPEAKER_00]: right to the outside of your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably do it on the inside,
but since we get that natural suction when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it on the outside, it just sucks
itself right to the tent, tape it in
[SPEAKER_00]: place, it'll stay right there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, David, I feel like I really
talked for a long time about setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope I helped you out.

so I do look forward to a follow-up email.
