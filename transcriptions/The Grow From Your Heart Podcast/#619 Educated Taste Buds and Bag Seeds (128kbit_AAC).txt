[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to the gang, the crew that
fired up that Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not there enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out a little bit in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be breeding seeds, packaging
seeds, doing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys are killing it on the
Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am elated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of words, a bunch of big
hallmark sounding words that I want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: to describe how I feel about the way you
guys are supporting Irie Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All things Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community that is sprouted from this
show, this company is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me and I can't stop
thanking you enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the people who created it,
the people who sustain it, and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who just hang out in there and
participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute to the entire Irie Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I want to talk about before
we get to the main part of this email or
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The email part of this episode,
excuse the new tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting used to this new face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll learn how to talk with it pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had it for 42 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting used to this English thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Thursdays, occasionally I join the
Embracing Organics crew for their podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really nice panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Dirtman Dan and the
entire Embracing Organics crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But occasionally on Thursdays,
I join the crew for an Embracing Organics
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens live on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We record approximately 7.10 PM Mountain
Time on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is live at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say the time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on at 7.10 PM Mountain Time on
Thursday on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply search for Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not on every single episode,
but I hang out quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be there every other episode,
but scheduling, live, things are weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have another guest where I
feel like I could just let that guest
[SPEAKER_00]: shine and I don't need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is on the Embracing
Organics show that is coming up on
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording today is the 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the show will be on the 11th.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this comes out, it will
already have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I encourage you to go back and watch
it because if all things go correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will be doing an Edibles challenge on
that show and I will have eaten a
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous amount of Edibles and I invite
you to come hang out, watch the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't happened yet, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show comes out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about another show that's
recorded in the future, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we're gonna have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to check out that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will come out Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that show will have already been out
for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not watched the Embracing
Organics Edibles challenge, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest you watch that it's got to be a
good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got quite a bit of Edibles that I'm
going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might fuck my whole night up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to come watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's move into something
more serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some emails for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email came from the Patreon inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you want your questions
answered, Patreon is the quickest way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to the top of the list at patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Tonto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy up there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hello Rasta man, I know you're
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm thankful all for all you do
and I know that your time is valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I believe that I missed a Nanner
somewhere in my recent crop because my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife and I have found some seeds while
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, big shout out to your wife
for helping you trim trimming sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can find someone to do it with
you, that's a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She deserves a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna high five, buy her some good food
and some fancy shoes because she's helping
[SPEAKER_00]: you trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes on to say, I don't believe the plants
had any pollen sacks as I have shown my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife what to look for in the garden,
but not Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also not ruling this out either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend thinks that they have found
possibly could have found Nanner's or
[SPEAKER_00]: missed Nanner's in their garden because
they did find seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by Nanner's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanner's are what we call male flowers
that pop up in a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has got intersex traits or
hermaphroditic tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female plant that just showed male
sex parts in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it a banana because it just
looks like a little banana that pops up
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes they come in clusters and it
looks like a little bunch of hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call those a banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are talking about is a male flower
or a male flower popping up on a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that is now showing us that it is
hermaphroditic and that one Nanner,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one male flower can produce pollen,
which will then produce seeds in our
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our buddy Tonto found a few seeds while
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't believe he had any pollen sacks
because he's shown his wife what to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for, but she doesn't know to look for
Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things could have caused this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the plants could have just stressed
out and seeded itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been pollen from another
plant somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the plants could have hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of opportunities to make
this happen until you actually look really
[SPEAKER_00]: closely and realize what happened you'll
never know unless you find the Nanner,
[SPEAKER_00]: find the pollen chucker, find the light
leak, find the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a big question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is, would these seeds
be considered good or would they be
[SPEAKER_00]: untrustworthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a quick Google search, but the
results were mainly forum based answers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are always taken with a grain of
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way to take any forum answers,
social media answers, forum answers,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I say should be taken with the
grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always do your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always realize that those people are doing
things their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may say, oh, you need to spray
it with this and do this, but they have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea what you're doing and their
suggestion may fuck you all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, every piece of advice that you
read should be taken with a giant chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I will grow these out
regardless out of pure curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be giving these seeds or plants to
anyone out for obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a man with good ethics,
good morals that understands the risks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available in these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say on a personal note,
I wanted to give a shout out to Parkland
[SPEAKER_00]: flower here in Alberta, Canada,
even though I am unreliable due to my
[SPEAKER_00]: injuries during my service, bro,
thank you for your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you are a service member and
we got to give you a big thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, especially since you've been injured
providing your Canadian service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, um, they are giving me the
opportunity to grow and learn at the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial level, which I think is such a
kind thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a beautiful blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a blessed, lucky man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, embrace that engage as much as you
can, uh, ask a lot of questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to teach them how you grow your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to learn how they grow theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out to our friends at
Parkland flower, uh, in Alberta,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada for giving my buddy Tonto an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and dude use all of the knowledge
you've gained here from the podcast in
[SPEAKER_00]: that commercial grow and you will shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's address the actual question,
the issue at hand, the reason this message
[SPEAKER_00]: was sent our buddy Tonto has got some
seeds that randomly appeared in his
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't know if there was a
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't know if there was a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what caused these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds will be known as bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's questionable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the female plant was because
we've got the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell you that much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not know who the pollen donor was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know who the baby daddy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a Maury Povich situation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, are these seeds worth
the shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I trust them or are they problematic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just as much as you don't know,
I don't know what's in those seeds at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be, uh, feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be beautiful females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be amazing mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be, uh, the most amazing
fucking flowers you've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, uh, in my opinion,
to the best of my knowledge, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog lineage was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were seeds that were found in buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about chem dog and the legend of the
13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll realize that a lot of the most
popular cannabis we were smoking came from
[SPEAKER_00]: what was known as bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds that were accidentally made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog bought a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds became the popular chem lines
we work with now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91, Chem D, Chem sister, all came
from a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are strains that set the precedent
and expectation for the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the world, the landscape of
growing, breeding, cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all people want to talk about is chem
and Kush because chem dog found those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in that bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat happened in a very similar
manner to what your seeds did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know how popular and in demand
golden goat is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Girl Scout cookies was an
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things that were
bread created this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were accidents and they became
stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have some complete bullshit
or you could have the next legend in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of seeds that you have got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let other people have them because
they could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also don't let other people have them
because they could be the fucking gems
[SPEAKER_00]: that make you famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a good eye on them while you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that you have got big question marks
on those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were free but they could be hermetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be ticking time bombs or they
could be ticking awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what else to other
advice to give you because until you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them you do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beauty of a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like those forum members were
saying it could be anything and take all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that advice with a grain of salt and
again take mine with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to tell what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do it is to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to it through the
entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is when you really have to start
learning how to pay attention to nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach the wife what to look for in
intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you stress that plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do anything weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch how it responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't get any
hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see any nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go completely weird on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also take a lot of pictures of it because
you might want to document this because
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have hot fire in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the next Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Tonto's Kush going on in there and we
don't even know it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow those out and see what you've got
and take clones when you grow them because
[SPEAKER_00]: what if you're growing the most amazing
shit ever and you don't have a clone on of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be completely
heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my buddy Tonto my advice is grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some clones and if they're worth the
shit grow them forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then send me a clone if it's hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with I hope everything
coming up for you is iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from our friend Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonto, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing what you have
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you make fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you make some crazy mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you've got going on in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to all my Canadian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see whose name they want me to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't sign it with a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to skip that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thank me by sending these messages and
you thank me every month by contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very good exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I travel the state of Oklahoma
fixing big yellow earth moving equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I used to be a courier that
delivered parts for your big yellow earth
[SPEAKER_00]: moving equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a bunch of blades and shit in the
truck all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to stop there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun job dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I clock a lot of miles on the road
while listening to the podcast which has
[SPEAKER_00]: helped my garden tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that awesome that you can get an
education and kill time while you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car and then turn around and make your
garden look better?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're getting paid for those hours
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you suggest a source for genetics that
are in close representation to key
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I wanted to grow a good Kush
or other key cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of stumbled on part of what he's
saying here, but you guys are getting the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to grow a good Kush or other key
cannabis flavors much like you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Golden Goat strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this person basically wants to do
it says I want to, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to build, I want to smoke and build
a pallet much like a sommelier studies
[SPEAKER_00]: their pallet for wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say that word correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just read it off the page and I
think I got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even study that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until legalization you just got what the
guy had, but now with the passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing I'd like to build my pallet so
that when the budtender says this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: gaseous gas or the stinkiest Kush,
I can know if they're telling the truth or
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to make a sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Golden Goat is up next to my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and keep it iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great interesting question,
especially for me since I talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: turps and flavors and aromas and people
tell me that I've got a magical turp nose
[SPEAKER_00]: or that I smell turps and flavors
differently, that I taste things a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more vividly than a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently discovered that I have got
something called synesthesia where I smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste in colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my pallet and my tasting and flavoring
things is vivid and quite more active than
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like this question talking about how
to develop your pallet and understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about how to go about doing this
and the only way I can think of doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: is try a lot of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that the sommelier gets good with
wine is he tries a lot of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the sommelier he takes a little sip,
swishes it around, gets a taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: spits that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fun part about being the weed
sommelier is we're gonna take a dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna smoke a bowl, we're gonna hold
that shit in and get the buzz and enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to spit it out every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that I would say is
smoke a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to travel around to a
lot of places and buy a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you say you travel around a lot,
stop at a dispensary everywhere you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford it, I don't know what
your budget is, I don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do, but get as much product as
you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab an eighth or a gram here and
there and make sure they're well labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when you go to the dispensary get
two different products that are vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a cushy thing and a bubble gum
flavored thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like a Golden Goat and an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that tropical and that funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really tell there's a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna tell you if the dispensary
and that grow has a difference in their
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of dispensaries,
all the product will taste very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a guideline on how their
product tastes, if it's all similar or if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can smoke those two different
products and you can see how does the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of say I bought Jeff's OG at
this place, it tastes gassy, cushy,
[SPEAKER_00]: mothballs, and swamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bought strawberry Starburst at
this other place and it tastes just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make notes, then go to another place
and buy another kind of Kush and another
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity thing and make notes on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to just remember when I smoke the
strawberry one, it tastes like strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke the OG Kush, it tastes like
mothballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just develop that palette, smoke a lot of
samples, smoke a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're gonna have to do is verify
that what you're smoking is actually what
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dispensaries, anything with the word
OG or chem will sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got strawberry something and
it's not selling, I'm gonna put the word
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry Kush on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will sell more quickly and the
dispensary will trick you and now your
[SPEAKER_00]: research is kind of tainted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna have to smoke a lot of
samples and develop that palette just by
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that foodies do it,
that's the way that someone does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a lot of consumption, a lot of
memory, a lot of note-taking, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience builds a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience is something you can't buy,
it's something that you just have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: and that develops a lot of details,
a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience will develop your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try a lot of samples, develop that
palette for various notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for things, try to be able to
identify gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna be able to smoke gas and fuel,
identify that gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants gas and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then be able to identify earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for that like earthy, sort of earthy
dirt coffee sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to identify that in your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then be able to identify the fruitier
flavors that come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get your strawberries,
your blueberries, your oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to identify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get good at finding the floral notes
that come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're kind of breaking it into
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting that earthy stuff,
we're getting the gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got categories, then you can
kind of say, well, this OG Kush falls in
[SPEAKER_00]: the earthy, gassy category.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberry Starburst was in the
berries and floral, maybe a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can start kind of making
subcategories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the gas, you can go with
chemicals and diesel fuel or regular fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: or cleaners and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you get earth dialed in,
you'll taste like dirt and mud and swamp
[SPEAKER_00]: and mothballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you break off into like feet and
funky shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you get that fruity palette
developed, you'll be able to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between like oranges and
blueberries and strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that'll come natural to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already tasting those things all
the time in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is flavored with berries and
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those flavors and aromas should be easy
to discern and separate and identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your fruity palette,
then that breaks down into like berries,
[SPEAKER_00]: tropicals and citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're also gonna get that floral
thing where you're gonna get stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender and lilacs, and you're gonna get
those hints of perfumey things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically start finding categories to
put flavors into, then find subcategories
[SPEAKER_00]: for those flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoke a lot of shit and see which
categories those fall into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make your own kind of bracketing
system, your own judging system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll find out how to categorize all
this stuff in your head, how to
[SPEAKER_00]: compartmentalize all of your notes in your
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really just start smoking it with
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a clean bowl, a clean pipe or a clean
bong, whichever your preferred method is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your damn dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of bongs, pipes and rigs that
are filthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dab rig gets so dirty sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clean that shit up and you're probably
gonna get more flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just buy a lot of shit and smoke it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that doesn't sound like a real
scientific approach, but experience will
[SPEAKER_00]: build your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just find the things you want to smoke
and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll start seeing that things
that say Kush kind of fall into this cushy
[SPEAKER_00]: bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a dirty foot, swampy,
mothball, gassy sort of a thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll find out that all the
diesels have this diesel sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that hazes have sort of a
spicy sandalwood, sort of a peppery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get a lavender smell out of
some hazes also, but you'll start finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the commonalities in all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll start being able to smoke
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take a hit and go, oh man,
I could taste the chem dog in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll really get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one day, maybe once you're around it
a lot, if you're in different groves,
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to different nutrients and
products, you'll take a hit off the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, damn, you guys, used way too
many worm castings in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of palate that you'll be
able to develop in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste products that were used in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know what shit smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what shit smells like
unless you've smelled some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get out in the world and
smell things, smell products.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're at the store, take a minute,
just smell the oranges, smell the bananas,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell the watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we all think we know what they
smell like, but just smell stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a minute and just enjoy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're walking around the flowers,
pick up a wildflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when the ladies see you taking a
moment to just stop and smell the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they see something in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're enjoying and appreciating the world
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your phone away for a moment and smell
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that to your arsenal, your repertoire,
your memory, your aromatic memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're going to call it your
olfactory memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you smell that in cannabis,
you can go, oh, that smells like lilacs or
[SPEAKER_00]: that smells like honeysuckles or that
smells like dog poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go smell some stuff and then you have
other things to compare that to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I sniffled into the microphone when
I tried to do that scent thing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that deviated septum and it's
rocking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, get us back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that's going to throw you
off is mislabeled product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that will definitely
screw you all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're testing a product that you think
is orange cush and it's fucking orange
[SPEAKER_00]: haze and you mark it down in your mental
notes as orange cush, you just fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: all the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smart enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're human.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust your notes and details and
data entry that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish that people wouldn't do things
like that to mess you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are going to be things like if
I grow, if I had OG Kush and you had OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and five of our friends had OG Kush,
there will be variables in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to taste, smell, burn,
and affect you a little bit differently
[SPEAKER_00]: based on my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my room's a little bit more humid,
maybe I'll get stickier, buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room's a little drier,
maybe you'll get fluffier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my room's warmer, maybe I'll get airier
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room is cooler, maybe you'll get
more dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things will have a role on
the flavor and effect of that finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, drying and curing will have a huge
difference and effect and role on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome of that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not dried and cured and processed
properly, the same plant, you can cut buds
[SPEAKER_00]: off of one plant and buds off the same
plant, dry one one way and one the other
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could taste completely differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that, you'll learn how to
taste a proper dry and cure while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning to identify different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be fun for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at my notes to make sure I've
covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line here is experience will
develop knowledge, test a lot of samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my last note was eat stuff and
experience smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to be around
non-cannabis things to expand your nose
[SPEAKER_00]: and your mouth palate, your flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: and your aroma palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be around things that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the botanical garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the farmers market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be exposed to all types of different
smells and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the desserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the entrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go smell a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like learning words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vocabulary gets better as you're
exposed to different words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your smells will get broader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your identifications will get better as
you're exposed to more smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, I don't think you want me to say
your name, so I'm going to skip that.
