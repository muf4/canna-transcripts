[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 867 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's podcast, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to send a
couple of shout outs to a few of the great

Your Heart podcast to my good friend Mel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send a fist bump and a thank you
shout out to Shotgun Yoda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
Grapevine Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow
From Your Heart podcast thank you shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to my friend Slowly Rolling Stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody

[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to remind you that the Grow
From Your Heart podcast is teamed up with
[SPEAKER_01]: AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe AC Infinity is the leader in
grow room evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is making growing easier and more fun
for home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have not already checked out AC
Infinity, I highly recommend you check out
[SPEAKER_01]: acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the link in the show notes or the
video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next seeds that you buy from iREDirect
will be made in a full AC Infinity
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tent, the light, the blower,
the fans, the controller, the entire room
[SPEAKER_01]: is AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm using it, I recommend you use it as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the seeds are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not grow the seeds in the same
environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out at acinfinity.com or use
the link in the show notes in the video
[SPEAKER_01]: description and use coupon code iREDirect
when you check out to save 10% off your
[SPEAKER_01]: full order at acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think that covers all of the
business here at the start of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to let you know that we made a
few changes to the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We changed the rules and we added a new
chat room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with that came a new gate to get
into the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears that many people are hung up on
that new rules gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to the iRE Army Discord server
and it appears that you are stuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: click on that little box that says rules
or new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see it because I've already
clicked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new box that says rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on those rules and re-click that you
agree and then you will be allowed into
[SPEAKER_01]: the server.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like many people are stuck on
that age gate, on that new rule gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't get past that, send myself or
another friend from Discord a message and
[SPEAKER_01]: we will guide you through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get everybody back on Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we made the new rules, when we added
the new chat, we had to add the new box
[SPEAKER_01]: and that seems to be tripping a few people
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Discord did not go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Discord is still thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually stronger and better than
ever before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made some new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some moderation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some updates and I invite you to
come join us on the Discord server and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you lost it, come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't find it, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will help you get to the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a link in the show notes and
in the video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if you've been stuck,
click on the part where it says rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: etiquette.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually what it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on the new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will get you right back on in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come join us in the Smoker's Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new chat that is called the
Gloves Off Lounge or the Gloves Off Chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is exactly as described.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Gloves Off.
[SPEAKER_01]: People may say things to you that bother
you in there, but you can say shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: bothers them right back in that chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it respectful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in good fun, but there are no
rules in that chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody pisses you off and says
something weird, you just got to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not into that, stay upstairs in
the Smoker's Lounge, the Grover's Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of rules there,
but be prepared for that Gloves Off Lounge
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is exactly what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I've made the Discord update.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked about... Oh, the next thing
I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been following along,
you have heard that I've been working on
[SPEAKER_01]: some GMO reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Skunk Master Flex cut of the
GMO plant quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does not stand for garlic,
mushroom, onions in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that GMO is named GMO is
because when that plant became popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: also at the same time, the Girl Scouts of
America were selling their cookies and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was discovered that those cookies were
highly made with a lot of GMO products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of genetically modified
product going into the Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the GMO plant is a Girl Scout cookies
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Chem4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Girl Scout cookies, they bred that
together to make a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dude named Skunk Master Flex was growing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found a phenotype that smelled super
funky and he called it GMO because the
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl Scout cookies of America scandal had
been so popular in the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the GMO idea kind of inspired the name
to go with the GMO plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not stand for garlic, mushroom,
onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of the Girl Scouts of America
controversy at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that name came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows kind of tall and stretchy,
but you guys know that's the shit that I
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes super funky aromas and flavors
like this garlic, pungent, funky,
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty bar trash can, sort of a garlicky
mashed potatoes sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love that aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to reverse the GMO and put that
pollen on nine different females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had nine ladies in a tent ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looked like it was going well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see where I'm headed with this
because I'm talking that it failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I used three
different solutions of products to reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the reversals were successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got beautiful anthers, pollen sacks,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treated a female plant with three
different clones of the same plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: three different solutions in an attempt to
see which would work best for reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three reversed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautifully, lots of male flower clusters
on this female plant, lots of pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: sacks, if you will, all over this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I noticed, it was not making
any pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let these plants go much longer than
I've ever let reversals go before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did not get one single flake or dust
of pollen out of the reverse GMO plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave up on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them go and I just put them in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, fuck it, we'll see what they
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even do anything after being
left in the dark for several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turned really purple and looked
really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did not get any pollen from the
reversed GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out there working with GMO
and you've reversed it and made pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: share your secrets with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasted too much time on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so the reverse GMO project did not
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people ask me, have you ever had
reversals or breeding projects that just
[SPEAKER_01]: completely failed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, reversed GMO was a complete waste of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got nine females and an AC infinity
tent that are ripe and ready for pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that reversed GMO looked like it was
going to give me pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reversed and made the pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: His nuts were empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pollen at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some on black paper and rubbed it
around and you could not find one flake of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen on the black paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely empty, dry, no pollen at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did, since I had a bunch of female
plants that were ready to go, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: itching for pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was prime time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some other pollen in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it adjust to room temperature before
I used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to go sprinkle in frozen
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't seem smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it on the table right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let the pollen warm up for several
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on that night, I had a nice bag of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I took that pollen and I sprinkled
that bag of pollen all over the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen was a little bit old,
so I'm not sure how well it took.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the pistols have turned brown and
withered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be because of the age of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be because of the pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, it's too early for me to
tell if any seeds have formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the pollination took, however,
if it did take, I will let you know which
[SPEAKER_01]: plant I used for that pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I don't want to tell you what
pollen donor it was, because if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work, that's two times that I've hyped you
up on a cross and let you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the update is that the GMO reversal
simply did not give me any pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those GMO reversals we were
drooling over, we were excited about,
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's breeding life.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, as a grower, as a farmer,
I understand that's fucking life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to gather my sticks and I'm
going to move on and keep going and try
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used other pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if that pollen was viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I get a whole five by five full of
great flowers that Mike and I are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to smoke and we will try again with a
different plant in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the next crosses are going to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another feminized cross coming
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that will be more golden goat
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, it's just keep going,
keep trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason for this was to let you know
the GMO did not make any pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those crosses are not coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also just to share with you,
not everything is a wild success.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a crazy, miserable failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no misery to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was heartbreaking watching these plants
build these beautiful flowers and no
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen come out of them for days and
watching the girls go, hey, we want pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy's going, I just can't do it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bottom line, pollen didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next bottom line going to keep moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crosses aren't coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do in the iRE Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I covered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are covering a lot of ground very
quickly here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I remind you that there is a sale at

[SPEAKER_01]: I have said enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into the question and
answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys come for the questions and
answers, not the random rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question came, I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that tab and send me a good grow
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds off my website,
iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first question came from my new
friend, Vince.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vince, good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes just a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a new
listener and a new subscriber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just popped my first seeds in rapid
rooters and I transplanted straight into
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got your first seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They popped in the rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you popped them into five gallon
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says my question, what is the benefit
in transplanting into smaller pots first?
[SPEAKER_01]: And have I hindered my grow in any way by
skipping the smaller pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your new friend, Vince.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Vince, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly, just to make you feel better,
right at the beginning, you did not hinder
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk about why we do this,
the reasoning we do it, the pros and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next time you can decide if it's
something you want to do or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first reason I myself and most
cultivation spaces, growers, areas prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: to go, we call it graduated pot size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start off with a six inch net pot,
maybe a small one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my clone comes out of the cloner or my
seedling sprouts goes into a six inch net
[SPEAKER_01]: pot or a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I like that is because that
little tiny pot only takes up this much
[SPEAKER_01]: space in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while my plants are only one inch,
two inches, three, five, seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, nine inches tall, I only need a six
inch net pot, one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably 10 inches in diameter,
eight inches in diameter worth of space
[SPEAKER_01]: for that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to pop a 10 pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got 10 small pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put all of those pots in five gallon
pots or all those plants in five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: pots, my 10 inch root zone now becomes
what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably 18 inches for a five gallon
pot, at least 14 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a drummer, so I'm going off snare drum
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the same size of a snare drum,
maybe a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at 14 or 16 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to fit those 10, one gallons
under a very tiny light and very little
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first advantage is the amount of
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get them all in a smaller space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since they're in a smaller space,
I can use less light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not spread out so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in one confined, contained
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm using less space.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grower, you're a new grower,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space will become very valuable to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you grow, the longer you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing a grower wants more of is
more grow space constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that real estate is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smaller pots for smaller plants
give me more real estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to waste big pot space for
little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can cram more in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can veg more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're setting up a perpetual,
it gives you more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second issue is light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got 10 pots in big fucking space,
I need more light to cover that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That starts to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm running light, which costs energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I run that light, now I have to have
a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have to have possibly an air
conditioner, a humidifier, a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more space you use, the more light,
the more gear it starts compounding and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting more expensive quite quickly at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I think about is feeding
and watering these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple things to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your root zone is only this big,
you only need this much water to saturate
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant and water it satisfactorily,
to satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill in the words there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ad-lib however you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you only need so much water to water
this little space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of advantages to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water costs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrients you are feeding those plants
cost money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got to feed a one gallon pot,
you only need one portion of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding a five gallon pot,
you need five times as much water,
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings me to another issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that small plant is in that big root
zone and that big pot and all that soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to over water and flood that
plant and drown it because you've got such
[SPEAKER_01]: a big root zone, such a big dirt area that
you need to get water to the whole space
[SPEAKER_01]: where the roots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the roots aren't established and
strong enough and big enough and going
[SPEAKER_01]: deep enough to handle all the water that
you're giving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're creating issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is nice and saturated,
but the plant is actually fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling because it doesn't have the
roots on deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They handle that much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a smaller container, the roots would
develop more and they would establish more
[SPEAKER_01]: and you wouldn't over water as easily
because you don't have, there's not much
[SPEAKER_01]: room for as much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it easier to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it safer to water and it saves
you water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already saving lights,
air, water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it doesn't take as much soil to
fill that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to, if you're on a budget,
you're going to buy that soil next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just let them grow in those small
pots for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get bigger, start to get root
bound, then put them into those bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing is light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing is watering and feeding
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need more water and more
feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your bottom line is, did I mess up by
not graduating pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I prefer to do is I go from that
clone into the one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it grow until it's almost root bound
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, if I lift that pot off the
plant, I like to see roots all over that
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see it nice and full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll take that one gallon and move it
into either a three, a five or a seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this situation, just like you,
I'm going to go to a five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would fill up my five gallon pot and
then I would take the pot that the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is in and I would plop that pot right into
my pot, my new pot, follow along,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes sense, and bury around that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm doing now is making a template of
where that pot is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I take that pot out of the dirt and
remove the pot off the root ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I grab the root ball from the bottom
and I kind of stick my fingers in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and pull that root ball apart a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those roots in that dirt are super tight
in that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've kind of grown into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made this nice, perfect cylinder
shape, just like the pot they came out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grab that and disrupt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to break that a little bit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want to put that into my new soil
and I want to leave maybe a half inch
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed out of the new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to bury that whole,
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to leave, excuse me, I'm burping
and trying to fight through this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to save about a half inch
exposed because that is a good space for
[SPEAKER_01]: air to get to my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do over water, those roots can
receive oxygen through that top little
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not drown the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I dig that hole, I make the little
template hole, take the pot off,
[SPEAKER_01]: break up that soil a little bit,
and then just plop that right into that
[SPEAKER_01]: hole and leave it up just a little bit,
just a fraction of an inch, maybe a half
[SPEAKER_01]: of an inch just to leave a little bit of
air space for those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I backfill it and then I water it
just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my reason for breaking up those roots
a little bit is I believe that that
[SPEAKER_01]: encourages them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been going into that pot and
wrapping around and spinning and just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to find somewhere to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They filled all the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within that pot, within that soil,
if I break them up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of encourages them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes, hey, we can go play guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been freed up a little bit and they
start traveling different directions and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll fill your soil, your container much
more evenly and much more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you break them up a little bit,
give it a little head start, give it some
[SPEAKER_01]: encouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fill the pot with dirt most of the
way, put that pot with the plant in it in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, fill it up around the pot,
make myself a nice template, take that
[SPEAKER_01]: out, pull the pot off the plant,
break up the roots a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: plop that in there and then just bury it
kind of nice and not snug, not tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pack it in there and just brush the
dirt over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cover that top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see just a little ring right at
the top in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your little air area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I mix up a decent feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a basic base mix, maybe a light
cow mag, a little bit of liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on if you're going to put
potassium silicates in there or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, I would definitely feed
some sort of root inoculant, some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm going to recommend
recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my buddy Scotty Real,
but get some microbes in there and get
[SPEAKER_01]: those roots growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a really good opportunity to feed
those roots and get them going shebang
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my basic how I transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why, because I don't want to
waste all that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's only this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I need a pot this big for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait till the plant gets this big,
then give it a pot this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll really help out,
save you some space, water, time,
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can build a continuum with all
your free prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Vince, I think I've answered
your question quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox and check
your spam, because you've got a coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code for a free pack of seeds at IriDirect

[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next question also came from the Grow
Help tab on IriGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from a friend who wants to
be called BlackRay3K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend BlackRay3K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check your inbox, because you've got a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I appreciate all
the knowledge you have been dropping on
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm glad you're here for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, My question is about organic
versus synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good question and a great
debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Which one is best for home
growers to use and with what growing
[SPEAKER_01]: medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a little bit biased, but let me try
to stay even here and not biased at all
[SPEAKER_01]: and stay objective and give you some solid
advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both work very well for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both will work very well for home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both will give you very great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of what you prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no better or best.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not a better or best.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to synthetic or organic,
there are pros and cons to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pros, I think, to synthetic nutrients
are you can buy a bunch of bottles from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grow Store and you can go to the
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say you went to the store and
you bought Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bought five bottles of Botanicare
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go home and you can go to the
website, type in Botanicare nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: calculator, and it will show you on week
one, feed 10 milliliters of this per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed five mills of this per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: On week two, feed this and this and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On week three, so the advantage,
the pros to bottled nutrients is you can
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the store and buy everything you
need in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the website and find a recipe week
by week that will work for your garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: you will have a successful grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hold your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell you the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell you how much to put in,
how often to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pH it correctly and feed it like
they say, it works every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeatable process, repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the pro, my favorite pro to
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy bottled nutrients,
it's the same thing every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reliable, repeatable, processes and
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, you're paying for a lot of the
time, you're paying for water to be
[SPEAKER_01]: shipped across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're buying bottles of water,
shit that is mixed with water and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the pros and cons of
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like the pro of organic
because the word organic, it means it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives us the idea that it's safer and
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic just basically means that it is
carbon based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the cons of organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyanide is organic and it can fucking kill
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too caught up in the word
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, when we're going to talk
about organics, we're going to focus more
[SPEAKER_01]: on the products and the idea of building
an organic product and not the buzzword of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's natural so it's better for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I said a moment ago,
if we put cyanide in our weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just focus on the organic
construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not being sold by the it's better
because it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use the natural version
like the building blocks naturally version
[SPEAKER_01]: organic for this conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that makes any sense to you because
it barely makes sense in my fucking head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the organic idea because depending
on which method, there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different methods you want to take that
you could take to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go to the store and you could
buy boxes of all the meal, the bone meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal, fish meal, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go get all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that, you're going to pre-mix all of
your soil and let that cook and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll put the plants in there and that
stuff will become bioavailable over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how the organics are going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: For your bottle nutrients, you're going to
feed today and basically what you feed
[SPEAKER_01]: today, those plants are going to start
eating that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the organics, you've got to let it
break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to become bioavailable to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottle nutrients have what are called
chelates and buffers inside of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those chelates basically force your plant
to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the organics, the roots roam around
and go, hey, there's minerals and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and vitamins and shit that I
need over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes, oh, I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some here, but I'll wait until I
need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll metabolize that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're feeding the bottle nutrients,
the plant goes, ah, shit, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because the way that it's chelated,
the way that it's processed in that
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle, the way that it's formulated,
the roots touch it and the roots go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to eat this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just take it up right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pros and cons there.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the organics, you're going to mix
your nutrients all into that, mostly into
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil, depending on how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm talking about the so many
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go buy all the boxes, you premix
it, make a super soil sort of an idea out
[SPEAKER_01]: of your organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to cook and it's got to
release over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not in there, if you did not
already put it in there, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in there for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a little while for your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do feed a tea or a top dress,
it's going to take a while for the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: to notice that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm feeding bottles, bottled nutrients,
they're going to notice right away very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm feeding a soilless mix,
I'll see results two to three,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm feeding cocoa, I may see results
within four to six hours, maybe even
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker, depending on how badly I fucked
up feeding those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chelation is a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like eating a big healthy meal or
taking a bunch of steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organics is like eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a plate of food in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep eating and you eat and you
get what you need with the bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm just shooting the minerals
and the nutrients and the vitamins
[SPEAKER_01]: directly into your neck and you're fucking
getting them if you need it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get too much of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get possibly overloaded on
something and you might see some
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kind of the differences on
organics and synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer and this is just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run fully bottled nutrient systems,
a lot of dry nutrient powder nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do the synthetics, the salt system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I do that is because I came,
I developed, I learned very strongly in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial production environment and a
lot of times I'm teaching other dudes how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the cultivation leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a group of dudes that are going to
mix up these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm not there, there are going to be
guys mixing up these solutions and feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said earlier, I need to be able
to write a recipe on Monday, feed it like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to mix up 500 gallons of
water and put this many milliliters of
[SPEAKER_01]: base nutrients, this much cow mag,
this much bloom booster, this much
[SPEAKER_01]: silicium, excuse me for the burps,
but I want to write down a recipe that the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys at The Grow or the gals at The Grow
can repeat to perfection on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a commercial environment,
I need to be able to adjust on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see that this room is doing something
weird, I need to be able to feed it and
[SPEAKER_01]: correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is just not my way for a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people out there do it successfully
and they do it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not how I prefer to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mixing up their super soil,
their living soil before they even put
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're letting that cook for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They plant the plants and the plants live
in that soil forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ever have to get fed any bottle
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that mix is not right at the
beginning, you're screwed all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be mixing up teas and
chasing it and trying to find solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a commercial environment,
I think that for a large scale production,
[SPEAKER_01]: for me, the bottle nutrients are just
easier and more repeatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time there's the same amount of
everything in those bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the organic, if you're making ferments,
if you're making teas, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: much of what you put in, you could get
highly variable results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but that's not as critical because your
plants are going to take that up as it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying there are pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you there's no better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither one is best or least least or less
than is what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do like fermented fruit
juices and fruit extracts and shit like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: To feed your plants, which I'm not
knocking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of friends who were into
JDOM and my buddies like, bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out hiking today and I came across a
whole bunch of whatever flowers and I cut
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of them, put them in a bag,
brought them home, made a fucking tea out
[SPEAKER_01]: of them and fed it to my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, that's actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's much more sustainable than
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to go to the store and buy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the store runs out of shit,
I can fall back on those organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know how to do it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my buddies that are doing the
organics, they're already doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One friend that I do have that grew
organically with organics for several
[SPEAKER_01]: years since I met him, he's been growing
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then our friends at New Millennium gave
him a box set of all the New Millennium
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and he ran it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing he said to me was that
he wished he had all of the weed he had
[SPEAKER_01]: been shorting himself by running organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was quite impressed with the size of
the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: He improved his yield quite a bit by
shifting to the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only thing that he mentioned
was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, bro, I wish I had all the weed
I've been shorting myself all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to call you out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a great grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually running a commercial
facility now, and I'm pretty sure it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: on bottles and not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he shifted, went from the organics to
the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check my notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said cyanide is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too much caught up on buzzwords.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to grow organically,
make sure that there's a reason behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you didn't just choose it
for hippie nonsense reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the organics is much more long term
and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do this forever,
if you want to do this when Babylon falls
[SPEAKER_01]: and the lights go out and we're relying on
the sun and mixing our own nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic way will still be viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be able to go to the grow store
and buy a bottle of liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to learn how to make
that shit on my own, which I got all you
[SPEAKER_01]: hippie friends for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll trade you seeds for some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one of the big advantages when
Babylon falls, when the trucks quit
[SPEAKER_01]: running, when the stores are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jadam will be Jadamming still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part of the organics,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to keep going and
buying bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting bottles shipped to me and
there's water in them and that feels a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both can have repeatable results if you
understand what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't repeat the results in the organics
because I don't know what I'm doing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I've been rambling long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, my question organic,
which one is best and with what growing
[SPEAKER_01]: medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither one is best.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both equally awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix them, but when you mix them,
you're not organic anymore because organic
[SPEAKER_01]: means when you're growing organically,
it means you haven't added those synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you add that no longer organic,
the word synganic is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic means you don't have the
synthetics in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say I mixed the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been rambling on about this
one for long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to pull more info out of my
head because I know I've got more to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ts are fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love brewing up a good tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feed a compost tea to your
synthetic mix if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add those organics in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the organics are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a city boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's part of my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a city boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My neighbors can hear me fucking recording
this podcast right now with three
[SPEAKER_01]: different directions, that side,
that side, and the folks behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've heard every fucking episode,
every edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the whole podcast by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a city boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing with bottled nutrients in the city
just seems to be a little bit easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had some land, a more private
backyard where I could do some shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I may work on some organics and do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were growing outdoors, I would
probably go organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I grew outdoors, I would do a full
hippie organic style.
[SPEAKER_01]: But indoor, commercially, production-wise,
I feel like bottled nutrients are the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, blackray3k, bro, you got me
rambling pretty good.
