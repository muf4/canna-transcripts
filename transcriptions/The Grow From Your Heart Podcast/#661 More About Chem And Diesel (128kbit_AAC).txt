[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff,
and this is episode 661 of the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a bit of
a correction, maybe a recap from a
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that part of the show,
let's do a few shout outs to a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind folks who support the show on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast with a big thank you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my friend Stoner Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
Justus Smokin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Root305 and Noah N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you to BigSexyDank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big fist bump to a
longtime supporter, Nomi by my guacamole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Paul F.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Grow Man Stan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big fist bump to a fellow
podcaster, Justin Klosser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow
From Your Heart podcast thank you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my friend Rasta Greenthumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a link in the show notes and the
video description to make it nice and easy
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the routine if you're driving,
if you're working, if you're trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself in trouble,
don't get burned, don't get in a wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That link will be there when you are
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking to get the 1000 member mark
so we can do some giveaways and some
[SPEAKER_00]: prizes and some contests over there on the
Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we've got 1000 members, we will be
giving away prize packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be contests, photo contests,
other contests, other giveaways,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more shenanigans are to come on
the Discord channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way for us to get away from
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of reliant on the other social
media companies who have a lot of control
[SPEAKER_00]: over what we can and cannot post and can
and cannot say, especially being a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do like to censor some of the content
that I post and I do fear that some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: posts and my accounts will be removed by
some social media brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Cannabuzz will never remove my
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other content providers,
the places where we can share social media
[SPEAKER_00]: content, they may remove our cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the Discord because it is
kind of a middle ground between my website
[SPEAKER_00]: and social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website, I like to keep it kind of
professional, kind of businessy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a chat there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a forum there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a place for me to put the
business stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about that is I don't know,
I could learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't update the website myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the website commands and
programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another guy that does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rely on you and you do a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not my zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I love about the Discord is I can
post real time updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can answer questions in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's something I want to do in real
time, I can manage that on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really nice go between,
in my opinion, between social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: between the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can edit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do things on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they're not going to edit me or
censor me like they do quite often on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the long way of saying,
come join us on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the show notes and in the video
description, I've realized that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: the link I was using may have been a link
that expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have corrected and edited that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a current link, a valid link
in the video description and in the show
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some servers, the show notes don't pop
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that some of the places where
you get the audio feed, the show notes
[SPEAKER_00]: don't pop up the way they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go check the go to
YouTube, find the link to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a couple of clicks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But join us on the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some giveaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pop in and hang out in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the video chat at least once a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in there just chatting with the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave does some auctions and other things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop in, join us on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else do we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done some updates and some things
to the Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a sale happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were part of the Discord,
if you were part of the Patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were part of the newsletter,
you did receive a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a lot of things on the Etsy
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are flying off the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of packages went out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: More packages will go out tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to kind of clear out some of
the remaining remnants in the Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of boxes with like two
and three shirts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get rid of those two and
three shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once those shirts are gone,
I'm going to use that fund, those funds
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Etsy store to restock the shirts
that are out of stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want certain sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some new merchandise coming,
new shirt designs, new merch coming and
[SPEAKER_00]: restock of old stuff soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are sizes you have made,
you've missed, it is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's something that you've been
looking for, if it's in your size,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably on sale right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the newsletter, join the Discord,
join the Patreon and you will get a coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code for the Etsy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't need a coupon code,
just go hit it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the website, the iregenetics.com
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find the link to the ire store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Etsy store is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, why do you have an Etsy store
when you've got a professional website?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can edit that on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can edit that, correct it, adjust it,
change all the inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do everything on the fly really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super simple for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to simplify and streamline some
things and that was the quickest,
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the merchandise, the non-seed
merchandise is available on the Etsy
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm advertising a lot at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go a little faster with this part so
we can get to the fun part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I really want to
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at ChiTown
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: ChiTown Seeds will be attending the
Chicago Kanekon event.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were listening to this podcast when
it comes out, the next day, the Friday and
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday is the Chicago Kanekon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find my friends at ChiTown Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have iregenetics in stock on
hand ready to go at the Chicago Kanekon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, ChiTown Seeds loaded up with
plenty of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got iregenetics and plenty of
other breeders on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't make it to the event,
you can still follow ChiTown Seeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media and you can still get your
beans from ChiTown Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of great iregenetics and
other brands in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into some of the edits,
corrections, and updates from a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get two great responses from a
couple of things I've said on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to find out which one I want to
do first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may turn into a long podcast,
which I think you guys may appreciate,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll jump right into the one that I think
may go long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signed it with the name Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say if he wants his name said,
but there are a lot of Adams out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know Adam from Adam,
so it could be any Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Let me wrap up that first
paragraph with, bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of stuff to start off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to the interviews,
the strain descriptions, you've been a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, and you've grown the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, you're on the team, you're OG,
so that's a great way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, now for the review part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we get critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did touch later on in the episode about
how to make a true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to sidetrack myself too much
talking about F1s and polyhybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that episode, because if you know me,
it is very easy to sidetrack me and get me
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really trying to stay focused on
that grow lesson, but you are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said truly we're fucking with
polyhybrids and not F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what is being bred, what we're
buying, what we're purchasing is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: a polyhybrid, not a true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F2s are getting us closer if they're
even F2s, because if we started anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: see, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get on a good ramble really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue with this,
but I do have a nice reply and I enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: these respectful reviews and criticisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not taking this with any,
there's no salt in my game here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy this, but it goes on to say it was
kind of a let down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know better, please go into detail
about homozygous and heterozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes and why it matters and the
parental stock of true F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would serve the community well
to stop calling all the polyhybrids F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few breeders even talk about finding
or creating homozygous lines to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents for F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I challenge you to geek out hard on
breeding for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am all up for a challenge of geeking out
hard on breeding, but that's not my goal
[SPEAKER_00]: for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your passion and your desire
to inspire me to go further with breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not really what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me read my notes and get myself
back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is completely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you were saying is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was later on in the episode,
I did go down line breeding a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of create a more homogenous
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in this podcast, my goal isn't
really to go that deep into breeding yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 661 episodes in, and I feel like
people are finally getting a good grasp on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal for this podcast is to give you
the basics, to get you at a, to get you a
[SPEAKER_00]: good foundation, to be a solid,
reliable, grower, to understand the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I will give in depth breeding advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe I'm just not ready to do it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not where the show has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to get everybody go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are podcasts that are,
that teach much more advanced levels than
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are podcasts that don't teach as
advanced as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no judgment or on that,
but I think that where my audience is
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, where I'm trying to take my
audience is more to a, uh, self
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable, self reliant, sort of a grow
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of the people that are
trying to breed are already reading the
[SPEAKER_00]: books that you're trying to get me to talk
about, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go there, but I'm not ready to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that the audience is
ready for it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I will lose some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get some people with a notebook
taking a lot of notes, but my goal now at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point in time for this podcast,
learning this new gear, getting this new
[SPEAKER_00]: setup right now, I'm kind of focused on
getting everybody going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get, there's so many new
States legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many new people learning about
cannabis that I just want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's got the prerequisites,
the basic skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to drive change lanes
and parallel park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we can all drive, change lanes,
parallel park, merge properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll start teaching us how to do
fucking turbo tricks and fast turns and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't, uh, I just don't want to go
there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like my audience,
um, that's not what they're coming to me
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you are because you're asking for
this, but these are conversations that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, uh, more on the discord channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is stuff that I do geek out late at
night on discord with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'll probably sign off of this
podcast later and I'll go to discord and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be, Hey guys, let's talk about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've been inspired by it and we'll
just geek out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because then it is a two way
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some feedback and we can talk and
you can spark my brain a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for here on this podcast, I think my
goal is more to get you started and give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the prerequisites in time in due time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will teach you all of the breeding
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will clear up all of those
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's actually asked a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: About, uh, myths and misconceptions about
cannabis and about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will make sure to include a part
about, uh, F ones, true F ones in that
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Adam does include a nice
example of co-dominant alials and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to produce the traits that we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary to read all
of that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a lot for somebody that
doesn't understand breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks about finding plants,
breeding a pink plant or a red plant to a
[SPEAKER_00]: white plant when your goal is all pink
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks about the options and the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very intriguing, but I'm not ready
to present this in the podcast yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's just not what I'm ready to
teach the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may talk about this on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this may be a chatter somewhere else,
but this is just not what I'm trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will touch on the, the obvious fact here
is that a lot of what we are calling F
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are not true F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have very similar parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cookies right in the lineage,
which kind of right there technically
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we cross two cookie dominant or took
cookie parented plants together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've made a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't really done any F one work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, I will work out a long
episode that has a lot of this included in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a breeding episode with a lot of
myths and misconceptions that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that is coming up that will have F ones
and other stuff included in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me make sure I covered all of my
notes on this because I do write stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of the paper here and sometimes I
get so chattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it looks like I got all of that
stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, most of my listeners,
honestly, I don't think, and no disrespect
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are, but I think the majority of my
listeners are here to learn, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a good solid foundation on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll catch up to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I feel like I've given all that stuff
out again in the video format,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of it is available on the old audio
format, but I want to get all that
[SPEAKER_00]: information out again in the video format
because it's getting much more noticed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The YouTube channel in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Adam, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I give you a satisfactory answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, those are not true F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk deeper about that in the
future, but right now I think we're on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right path for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward to another
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I told a story
about chem dog and the story of the 13
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a guy named, uh, let's see,
I mentioned a guy named AJ in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe brand and AJ, AJ is known as asshole
Joe, uh, who honestly, from what I read is
[SPEAKER_00]: not an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them at events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like an asshole,
but he got the nickname asshole Joe back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, I was honestly mixing up since
there's Joe and Joe, and I got a brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just joked them right together and made
that one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Joe brand and asshole Joe are two
different people in the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told about chem dog and the legend of
the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to swap out the name
AJ and put in Joe brand every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that story will be accurate to the
best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a correction and I'm
acknowledging that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the Google documents where you just
replace and every time I said one word,
[SPEAKER_00]: just replace it with another, but there is
a connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a connection to why I was putting
Joe brand and asshole Joe in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, asshole Joe is where the sour diesel
comes from and the sour diesel is related
[SPEAKER_00]: to the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about that just
because we happen to have pulled this
[SPEAKER_00]: story out just because it happened this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you've heard of the AJ's cut of
sour diesel, AJ is the one who is known
[SPEAKER_00]: for making the sour diesel popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sour diesel that goes around in
Colorado that, uh, it stinks up the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put it in two baggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good sour diesel makes my eyes itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them feel kind of funny when I
smoke it, which I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my eyes get itchy and super bloody
red, which a lot of herb doesn't make my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes red anymore, but that sour D we'll
get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it, I was just the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other people added the word sour to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we may touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a totally different podcast,
but let's delve a little bit into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there was the chem dog,
uh, story that I talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, legend the chem dog in the 13 beans,
two guys in Colorado, P bud and Joe brand
[SPEAKER_00]: get some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the dog, but, um,
they go to a grateful dead show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They meet a guy who, uh, wasn't called
chem dog yet later on in the future gets
[SPEAKER_00]: the name chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they become friends, Joe brand and P
bud later on male chem dog is not chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but he's about to become chem dog in
the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mail him some herb in one of the ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read there were two ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: One didn't have any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one had 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he pulls some seeds out and he grows
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they were calling the weed,
the dog bud or the chem weed, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: would make you roll over like a dog or
lazy, like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smelled like chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got done, dubbed the chem dog and
the guy that grew it and found it,
[SPEAKER_00]: found the seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became known as chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was chem dog, 91 chem sister,
and then a couple other, uh, variations of
[SPEAKER_00]: chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a male that was pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more seeds sitting around,
which may get grown in the future here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, this guy came up with the name
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts, uh, he's also a glass blower
and he goes to grateful dead concerts to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell his glass and to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's a great place to go sell some
pipes and make some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so chem is selling some pipes and he
meets this guy named AJ who is known as
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole Joe, but asshole Joe is not an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, uh, sell, they sell each other a
pipe chem sells AJ a pipe and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: being bros chem's like, well, let's smoke
a bowl out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't smoked out of it because you
don't smoke out of it until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, can we smoke out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And AJ is like, sure, but let's smoke some
of my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I got some good weed and it comes
like, nah, bro, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some fire weed and they both pull
out their weed and guess what they both
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both had the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both had the original dog bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of a bonding moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became friends at that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got two legends in the cannabis
industry becoming friends at this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, dog bud and dog bud in two different
bags from two legendary fucking people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AJ and chem have now met, uh,
and that's where I think I blended the
[SPEAKER_00]: story in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, they got the same weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the original dog, but now this is
where the story gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling AJ was calling his dog,
but diesel because, uh, anything he's from
[SPEAKER_00]: New York and anything that they were
smoking in New York that was good weed was
[SPEAKER_00]: called diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now the kids call anything that is
good gas, which I think is funny because
[SPEAKER_00]: gas should be weed that smells like gas,
not weed that smells like fucking berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells like berries, why are you
calling it gas, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, quit doing that, please culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but they would just call anything that
was good diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be some diesel weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that came from Canada because
I've got Canadian friends that call cool
[SPEAKER_00]: shit diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, so that probably came from Canadian
terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, the rumor has it, this is what
I have pulled out, uh, from folklore,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the internet, from history,
from people that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of people in the weed
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a few of the guys that might've
been involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mass super skunk plant accidentally
pollinated AJ's chem dog plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where we got the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I later on became sour diesel,
uh, because there was a crew that was
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it and they were sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were mad about other people or
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, the weed was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make other people mad and it was
pissing people off and causing rivalries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the word sour got attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story that I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the most sense from all of the
shit I have filtered from the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: the interviews I've listened to on the
podcasts, uh, and just things I know about
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, this guy, Kim has got the chem dog
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He meets up with a guy named AJ and they
both have the chem dog herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that AJ had a mass super
skunk plant that either harmed or was a
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is that it harmed it
accidentally pollinated the chem and made
[SPEAKER_00]: the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes back to a couple of episodes
that I talked about bag seed, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: bag seed, accidental seed can be the most
fire shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most popular strains ever,
ever in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the most popular things ever
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the 2009, 2000, about 2005,
2010 era, there was a group South of me
[SPEAKER_00]: that was growing the sour diesel that I
would line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I knew where to get a bunch of it,
I would line up and buy it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make my eyes funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give me, it's hard to give me
like a paranoid kind of like in my zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of high at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take a few dabs to get there,
to get the, the smoke sweats and the
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoia, but that sour diesel would make
it feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go in the grocery store and you'd
think everyone's staring at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's looking at you, but you just feel
like everybody is staring at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ice cream aisle would pulsate when you
walk down it and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sour diesel was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to recap because I may have
said some wrong information in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that I was calling,
uh, AJ, uh, asshole, Joe and Joe brand was
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the story wrong there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure to correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wanted to let you know how and why
I made that connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy, AJ that I had in my head was the
guy that gave us the salad diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Kim, big shout out to
AJ, a shout out to Joe brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who am I missing in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be somebody in this story
whose name I fucking not giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, P bud P bud is the guy that I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing but love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the people that, uh, man,
they made the legends that we are telling
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the forefathers of cannabis
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were working it and hustling it
before there was any thought of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, doing the old grateful dead
tour hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to those guys, founding the
culture, making some shit happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think, do I, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one question for you and then
we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, do they want their
name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want their name said, so I'm not
going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching a video and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, may I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you have too much air movement over
your girls from oscillating fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they do explain their environment,
their setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yes, you can absolutely have too
much airflow, too much wind on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes the plants will start to
look like they're getting leathery or
[SPEAKER_00]: papery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves just don't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't look like a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it just doesn't look like bugs are
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something just looks sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting wind burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if the leaves right by the fan look a
little bit shitty, if they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy, if they look dry, you were just
blowing all of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chafed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're getting wind burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been on the boat all day and their
faces all just dried out and they need
[SPEAKER_00]: some fucking, uh, some, some lotion,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you do need to minimize that
amount of air on those plants that wind
[SPEAKER_00]: burn will cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow down the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you're just, uh, you're creating
just a bad environment right there in that
[SPEAKER_00]: one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow down that fan, uh, move it maybe if
you have to, if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're in a tent, so you don't have
all the options, but turn that bitch down,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need so much fan movement in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timson humidity are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you can mess them up with that
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're seeing problems, they're
going to look leathery, papery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start clawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they may just start falling right off,
turning crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to be the section
right in front of the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the fan can absolutely start
messing up your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen,
Chuckers, new growers, old school growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, everybody out there.
