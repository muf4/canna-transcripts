[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting to my number right, number four,
microphone number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where that is over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of my front right-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your number right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My number right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My number, yeah, we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took like a half minute snagged
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been that kind of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there on microphone number four,
trolling me already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast, honey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming back and joining us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for calling me and asking me to
come over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, when I realized there was an open
mic, I was like, let's get Lindsay over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was super stoked.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just picked up food and I was like,
no, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to Jeff's.
[SPEAKER_01]: This joint is running like Usain Bolt,
if you want to fix that when I pass it to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody listening, thank you for joining
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get to that, I want to talk a
little bit about my weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I had a good friend
bless me with a front row ticket to reggae
[SPEAKER_01]: on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never been front row reggae on
the rocks, that's a damn experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got to say, Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought my first concert tickets to
Red Rocks today, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are we going to see?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to see G-Eazy on the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm old and I'm like, I have no idea
who that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you three make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I were discussing earlier that
how we're in a way different music than a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's like 10 years older than everybody
he works with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably, I'm the same age as Mike,
10 years older than most people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually get funny looks when I take over
the radio work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm used to it by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been happening for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's funny because I had a front
row ticket and the headlining band was
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's favorite band, which is 311.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess how much of 311 I stuck around for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the band that I wanted to see- That's a
good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into 311.
[SPEAKER_07]: They set it off at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of their favorite places to
play and it's one of the best venues in
[SPEAKER_07]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of the best venues in the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a spoiled brat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably seen 30 Red Rocks concerts
and that's no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 15 of them were widespread panic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was working that night and I caught a
couple of folks on Facebook and was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, I wish I was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember that you would probably
had just left the lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: As those videos were being posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to see Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people that listen to the
podcast frequently know that my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae band currently, it will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just my taste change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hear something that'll catch my
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Morgan Heritage has been my favorite
reggae band for a couple of few months
[SPEAKER_01]: here, probably the past year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played at 445.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to catch most of their set.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sounded fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played a bunch of new shit that I
didn't know, which was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wanted to hear some familiar
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to hear your favorites,
but I also like seeing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do kind of a jam band thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start off with one song and they
don't stop till about halfway through
[SPEAKER_01]: their set and they just segue song to song
to song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of did a medley.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your favorite song by them,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on the mood I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, not like this moment,
but I guess in this realm of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably throw on Jaseed is one of my
favorite songs by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then Strictly Roots is also a good
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a bunch of remixes that
they do because they're a reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll put out a single all the time,
but Strictly Roots is a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended and I was in the front row and
I looked back toward the sound booth,
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking into the crowd and I see one
of the band members hanging out and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, he's over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm not going to go bug him,
but he's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I turned around and his brother,
Peter Morgan was walking right past me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Peter Morgan is probably my favorite
reggae singer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could sound like anybody,
if I could sing like a reggae artist,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd probably be Peter Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds really weird because
he's got a high-pitched kind of voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of squeaky, but that dude could
fucking sing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could sound like anybody,
it'd probably be him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him or Richie Spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the kind of reggae voice I
wish I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I don't, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that dude walked right past me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just put my hand on his shoulder and
that dude is beefy, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, when he touched some
people, they kind of moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude did not move.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one step fucking Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my hand on his shoulder and I was
like, bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just turned around and looked me
straight in my eyes and he stood up his
[SPEAKER_01]: right hand and he shook my hand and he
said, respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he kept on walking because he
didn't want to get mobbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I would have stood there for
three seconds, he would have got crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he just kept on moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet pretty much my favorite
reggae singer at Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he walked by, time went on and then
Steel Pulse came on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steel Pulse might be my number two
favorite reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was great seeing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hitting a joint, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steel Pulse was great, but they were a
little slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything just seemed a touch slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting fucking old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all the dreadlocks are super gray in
Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dreads are getting gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really long, but they're getting
gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to my anonymous friend who
got me up front row there at Reggae on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band after that was Iration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to about a song and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, let's get the fuck
out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iration was not entertaining me one bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like the sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like Iration, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Roots Reggae, that Iration was not
doing it for me that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I left and I drove to The Secret Sash.
What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my buddy Adam Hill for
hosting The Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Hill was in a really good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet Adam's wife for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: She follows me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We follow each other on all the social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was cool to finally shake her hand
and give her a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Adam's wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bumped into Lindsey there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into the dad and granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Bobo Blastercoat there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Brett for a brief moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're ever able to go to a
secret session Denver, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you get on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come take some dabs with Lindsey,
myself, the dad and granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Max for that big ass dab you
gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Max for every time that we
see him and every time I see him,
[SPEAKER_09]: he is so, take this dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's some bacon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's some something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicated bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes medicated bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see people grubbing it at the
event and they look satisfied,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gives me some, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you medicate bacon?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can't speak.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think his is in the crust.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sugar glaze.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, yeah, he puts like a cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I could be wrong on that really.
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never eaten it because I'm a
vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would assume you have to like,
because I mean, cooking it in the oil
[SPEAKER_09]: wouldn't do enough because you wouldn't be
able to tell the dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real crispy and it's coated in
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he handed me some and gave it to me,
but I just gave it to Bobo Blastroko
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't eat bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I told him that I'm a vegetarian,
he kind of looked at me and he felt bad
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had been offering me bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He felt like legitimately guilty,
like, fuck, I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, it's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, here, here, I got this though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me a big ass dab, like a
really, like a manly size dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I told him I took it all in one
chunk, I'm good on that little one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we just smoke?
[SPEAKER_11]: That was space cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had a good flavor, a good smooth
burn, nice white ashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me about that company and
that packaging?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from Altitude Organic Medicine in
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to our friends at Altitude.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is pretty convenient for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of lazy when it gets to rolling
joints sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this dude showed up with two packages
of pre-rolled joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got stone from it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little leery about some places where
I buy pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're kind of suspect,
but these guys, they come through every
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of their managers is a very good
friend of mine and I trust that place
[SPEAKER_01]: because of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause I know she wouldn't represent a
place that wasn't, wasn't worth
[SPEAKER_01]: representing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got too big of a heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude showed up with packages of
pre-rolled joints of quality joints.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That, you know, I don't know why a lot of
more companies aren't pre-packaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that it says Sativa and Indica on
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea you guys over at Altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first place I saw that was a place
called Pride in Medicine in Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they fell off and all the new rules
came.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of different places doing
something similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like the way that this project
turned out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are slick.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good product too.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Willie Nelson strand, I've got a
chance, I get a chance to try just about
[SPEAKER_11]: every product out there on the market,
being able to travel the whole state.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm a sucker for name brand and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've tried the Snoop Dogg,
but Willie, I got to give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_11]: him.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the, his model, he actually grows his
weed in house, you know, unlike like Snoop
[SPEAKER_11]: he just come to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: He puts his name on something.
[SPEAKER_11]: He puts his name on the strand he likes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Willie actually, this is his company,
he grew it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went to Lucy's Sky in Denver and
they had a little room set up,
[SPEAKER_11]: had guitars, albums where he signed,
all kinds of merch.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then his, his joint packaging and- Is
that a recreational or a medical place?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's both.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody that's coming from out of
state, make sure you check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it called again?
[SPEAKER_11]: Willie's Reserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lucy's Sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucy's Sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can check out Willie's Reserve
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a dispensary where they got some
Willie Nelson memorabilia and merchandise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to go check that out
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's kind of for show, but the,
the, the get is the, is the bud.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's got, he's got concentrates and
edibles too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't tried those.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just tried a couple of pre-rolled
joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've just seen the packaging, the
packaging looked intense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the new packaging is intense.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a tube and then you pull it out and
then it's got another pre-rolled tube in
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a Russian doll trying to buy
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a- That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, what did you just bust out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just threw some, some snacks here on
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got for us?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, um, uh, this is the Incredibles monkey
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are 20 each square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is 20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move these right out of my
reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you more than Terps, but I haven't
eaten edibles since my experience at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Secret Sesh.
I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I'm, I'm kind of trying,
I'm trying to see how long I can go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bring you a lower dosage every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, it's, it's, uh, once I get on a
streak, I'm really weird and I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay on a streak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm on a streak.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got five milligrams in the car.
[SPEAKER_11]: A streak and no edibles whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whenever I pick a streak,
whatever I'm doing, I'm really stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I commit to something, then I just
like, once I made it like a week or two
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've broken the desire or whatever,
then I'm like, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just see how long I can go on
whatever I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's not eating meat, which has
been 20 something years now, or not
[SPEAKER_01]: brushing my hair, which has been almost 12
years or, you know, just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't miss either one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't miss either one of the brushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a bald guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his head shaved nice and close
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get almost, you can almost brush
your beard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my back hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be on the show more often.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to make your no edible streak funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I even showed up with edibles this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a bunch of high-end chocolates
that we just got into the shop that I just
[SPEAKER_07]: felt like trying.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, they come in a sample pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I brought the sample for us to play
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that got me those reggae on the
rocks tickets, that, that might be her
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite edible that you brought there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tiramisu one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a bunch of people ask me for,
and that's the one I plan on trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know how I act for lemon G
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how she gets for those tiramisu
edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: The packaging is impressive as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're totally compliant with the new
rules too, which I like is a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: that I've even that I'm getting samples of
right now, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Packaging.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when they rolled out, I think they
knew that that was coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just planned for it to get,
um, and, uh, I mean, I haven't tried one
[SPEAKER_07]: yet, but so far packaging and
presentations, a home run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember back in the day when we had a
dispensary and the packaging was basically
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these Ziploc bags with the product
name handwritten on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a few places still that sell weed
in, uh, baggies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would get the owner's owner.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the owners would walk in with a
laundry or not, you know, like the sweater
[SPEAKER_07]: storage bin, the big plastic bin for like
under the bed was one of those Tupperware
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that a lot of people make it
easy cloner out of.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it would be full of like slices
of banana bread, individually wrapped in
[SPEAKER_07]: Ziploc bags with just a piece of scotch
tape, taping the flap down so it fit
[SPEAKER_07]: tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was what went onto our shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it was exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know where they stayed when we
closed at the end of the night,
[SPEAKER_01]: right there on that shelf, nothing got put
away.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were never there longer than like
three or four.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like part of me is glad like we've
advanced to where we are now because I've,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a good thing that the health
department is overseeing edible
[SPEAKER_07]: production.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, um, I do, I never pictured
something like the product I'm holding in
[SPEAKER_07]: my hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even three years ago, let alone
five or seven, that's like something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would get from a really fine,
uh, chocolate company through the mail or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I figured I've heard a rumor about
the company that they got some exotic
[SPEAKER_11]: friendship, but that, you know,
that that's probably just somebody making
[SPEAKER_11]: it up, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, um, it's definitely, they've
definitely got a high-end chocolatier
[SPEAKER_07]: working for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are impressive as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I've paid a lot of money to give these
to girlfriends throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just non-medicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I've paid the same amount for these
that I paid for unmedicated chocolates
[SPEAKER_07]: more than one holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we're hyping them up,
let's give, let's give them a quick shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't pay for any advertising,
but they seem to be the talk of the show
[SPEAKER_01]: for a couple of seconds here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coda, uh, signature truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coda signature truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're packaged very nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in a black box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a condom package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a fancy condom box is what
it makes me think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had more than one person describe it
as that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the logo.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the box.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the logo.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes a circle and it, yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had heard about these long before I
actually got them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to see them in person.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, one, they were at the shop today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to grab a couple Lindsey just threw
a medium sized dab at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to take this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, slow us down for a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just know that we're getting higher for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are six pieces.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys dive in?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want one, the flavors are kind of
listed on the box here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, there's six of them in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many milligrams is each piece?
[SPEAKER_07]: Each piece is 10 milligrams per box.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only 60.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys can really dive in and try a
couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought you the baby step.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the starter step, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to infuse your lunch one
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep thinking that until I infuse your
lunch one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can infuse it with some acid or some,
some THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, how much does that package cost if
you're not an employee at the dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: What a snobby asshole are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the price I haven't learned yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You caught me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the one item on myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's that in one paper pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a price range?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a price range?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 23.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth it then.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a dude and you were in trouble
and your girlfriend's a pothead and you
[SPEAKER_01]: brought those home to your, to your
girlfriend, you'd probably be fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: She might think you've done something
wrong or something fancy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you got to, that's why you got
to save it till you already done fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: and just wait till she already knows when
you're in the dog house already and then
[SPEAKER_01]: show up with those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Regular gift bringer.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a, I screwed up good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't call my mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did your wife call your mom when you fuck
up?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but like Jeff was really concerned for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom called my wife, which it's weird
that we're talking about that now on the
[SPEAKER_07]: show, but these are delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know, girls do do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They call their significant other's
mother.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean like in thirties and forties to
title and like get them in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, my mom would just laugh
and hang up on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
Click.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, we did come together for an
actual podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to talk about dads and
chocolates and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just brought fun snacks and got kind of
carried away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much Mike called me semi-early
today for Mike and I, it might've been
[SPEAKER_01]: early for most of you folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably well into your day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just thinking to myself,
I bet you this conversation happened at
[SPEAKER_01]: one and it was still had an AM attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mike sent me a message and he's like,
Hey, uh, this is what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This reporter is looking for somebody to
talk to because there's this new story
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and he's like, would you like to
speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about two seconds later, my phone blew
up with a whole bunch of other people
[SPEAKER_01]: asking me, would you like to speak for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to speak for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm well spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm well known amongst the
cannabis community and they felt that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to all the people that
messaged me and wanted me to contact this
[SPEAKER_01]: reporter for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I passed the baton over to our buddy,
Mike, because I don't want to be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: news talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let Mike do it and Mike's well spoken
and eloquent.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reason, um, caregivers don't do
interviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a really good reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want to name it on the show,
but yeah, it's legitimately the Berkowitz
[SPEAKER_07]: effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what an only caregiver in Colorado to
really do an interview paid for it
[SPEAKER_07]: severely is still paying for it in many
very real ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it's been a lot of years in,
uh, in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that we had no caregiver
advocates down here as sort of,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, for lack of a better candidate that
became me.
[SPEAKER_07]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fight that I care about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, caregivers have been part of Colorado
for more than a decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we've never been part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I say we in a very general term
because I am not a caregiver, but,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, they're very much under attack again
right now in Colorado from a number of
[SPEAKER_07]: different angles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they're going after the doctors right
now and looking at plant counts there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every county is restricting the number of
plants you can grow in a home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, or looking to limit the size and scope
of your garden for, uh, in one way or
[SPEAKER_07]: another, if it's not by plant count
directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's a rough time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I predicted a couple of years back that
caregiving wouldn't be a thing by 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we saw this happen in Springs less
than a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's basically the same rules
are trying to implement that they did in
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs are trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, uh, it's even more than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already done it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and what they're, uh, what the,
what's going on right now is, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: our board of county commissioners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is, uh, talking about putting a question
on the vote this November on the ballot
[SPEAKER_07]: that says, uh, should we go to the state
and continue to lobby for a statewide cap
[SPEAKER_07]: of 18 plants per house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so even, even if you have a
medical recommendation from your doctor to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow an increased plant count of say 60
plants, then fuck your medical card,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck your needs, fuck your condition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yes or no, this, the new rules that
they're talking about wouldn't affect the
[SPEAKER_07]: card that you get written.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just affect your ability to grow
on that card.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be limited, um, to that number of
plants unless you had a specific type of
[SPEAKER_07]: property, um, which I haven't seen defined
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not in a house or a residence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because of what caregivers are and
what the other rules around caregiving are
[SPEAKER_07]: in Colorado, that means you can't be a
caregiver and have more than 18 plants
[SPEAKER_07]: period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, because of your caregiver,
you can't have a storefront or a building
[SPEAKER_07]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do it out of your home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so essentially these new rules stay
wide means no more caregivers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and your extended plant count card
could still exist and you just be assigned
[SPEAKER_07]: assigning that extended plant count to
your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which feels like is what they're
trying to do with most of the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to take away the caregiver
and send it all to a dispensary so they
[SPEAKER_01]: can make some tax money off of it and not
worry about what's actually needing to be
[SPEAKER_01]: taken care of.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been the goal statewide for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Caregivers have been the scapegoat,
um, for all continued black market
[SPEAKER_07]: activity in Colorado for the last eight
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, anytime a homegrown gets busted,
they're like, Oh my God, these medical
[SPEAKER_07]: rules are so confusing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go back and reread the article in
the paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's there, there was no paperwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it wasn't a caregiver that was
breaking the rules or manipulating the
[SPEAKER_07]: rules or hiding under the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a black market grower that's
been here for forever doing what they've
[SPEAKER_07]: always done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the only thing that's different is
that caregivers also exist in the same
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but caregivers are the public face of
home growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they take all that heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, at the same time, the state has gotten
a taste of recreational taxes and they've
[SPEAKER_07]: gotten a real look at the sales totals by
volume in the med markets, still eating up
[SPEAKER_07]: half of what Colorado period is selling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and they would love to tax that at the
higher rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So medical is kind of under attack under
all fronts right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, which is why I'm telling people to
register to vote for eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that, uh, you can clear up for a
lot of Colorado folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: People in Colorado have this thing that
they think that since as an adult,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're allowed to grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they get their basic six plant medical
marijuana card, are you allowed to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: your six plus your six, or are you just
limited at the original six?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on where you're living.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is confusing as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really, really, really, really is here
in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it matters city to county.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the city doesn't care what your plant
count is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I worked incredibly hard for a very
long time to make sure that the city of
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo did not implement a plant count
limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just, um, we found sympathetic ears
inside city government and myself and a
[SPEAKER_07]: caregiver here in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, who isn't willing to go on the news,
but is willing to work with city
[SPEAKER_07]: government.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, um, managed to get them to hear
reason and not do a plant count limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so they did a square footage limit and
require air filtration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we couldn't get them to hear reason on
a number of other rules they implemented
[SPEAKER_07]: that, uh, I don't support nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, uh, uh, in the county,
they've already passed an 18 plant count
[SPEAKER_07]: limit, which means if you live in Pueblo
County versus city uh, you're limited to
[SPEAKER_07]: 18 plants period.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you live in a residential area,
there are some exceptions to that and
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll have to look up your specific
zoning, um, your residence and then what
[SPEAKER_07]: the specific rules are for that zoning
designation before I could give you a hard
[SPEAKER_07]: answer on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: You answered my question because somebody
came into the dispensary the other day and
[SPEAKER_09]: told me that Pueblo was an 18 count,
um, county.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was like, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, look it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, I'm not going to look it
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to call Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, uh, I remember that fight and there
was not much public support against it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, caregivers are really busy people.
[SPEAKER_07]: The state put the squeeze on them several
years ago, um, with a couple of statewide
[SPEAKER_07]: limitations that, um, mean in practice,
caregivers don't have a lot of free time
[SPEAKER_07]: to lobby city council.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and when they do, they tend to get
treated pretty badly, um, because they're
[SPEAKER_07]: there for one specific issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have six months to learn how to
play the insane game.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're required to play to do things like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's often unfortunate that the system
works that way, but that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so caregivers have had a rough go
of it in Colorado and it looks like one,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe two more elections and, uh,
they're going to be something that's in
[SPEAKER_07]: our history books.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can really do, if you're part of
the vote, make sure that you, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: wait for this to come up on the ballot and
you do not allow them to limit our plant
[SPEAKER_01]: count to 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just as an example, if you've got a
four by four tray and you've got one
[SPEAKER_01]: light, it is very feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a lot of sense to run 64 plants
in that four by four tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a lot of plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut 64 clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they start popping fat roots,
you put them in the four by four tray,
[SPEAKER_01]: you put a little capillary mat down for
those roots to grow into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do, it's like an ebb and flow system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill that tray, then you drain that
tray every hour, fill it, drain it,
[SPEAKER_01]: fill it, drain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got 64 little plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You flower them and they're about six
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They finish off about 12 inches tall and
you pull about six or seven grams per
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pound of weed, but you got 64
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the same thing with one plant or
four plants under a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: just depending on how long you want to veg
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way easier to pull that pound of
cannabis from Mike's medicine with 64
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny, tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than it is with a whole bunch of big pots
and bigger plants that you have to veg for
[SPEAKER_01]: a longer time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like 64 plants is not like cartel
numbers kicking out a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one pound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like- Just one example.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, people, when they see something
like 99 plants is the state limit,
[SPEAKER_07]: they picture the plants they've seen in
the newspaper that are the size of a
[SPEAKER_07]: Volkswagen bus.
[SPEAKER_07]: They picture 99 of those suckers and they
just don't realize that immediately the
[SPEAKER_07]: numbers cut in half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because only half of those plants can be
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're talking about a caregiver with
that's growing 99 plants, it's often
[SPEAKER_07]: because they're caregivers for five
patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Often five patients and then themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And each patient requires two or three
strands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each strain requires one or two moms.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you start dividing out over life
cycles in two different rooms,
[SPEAKER_07]: all of a sudden you're just struggling to
stay under 99 and you're barely producing
[SPEAKER_07]: enough marijuana for just your patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to run a seed pack to find
something new, then you're really already
[SPEAKER_01]: over numbers as soon as you pop those 10
and get them planted.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it gets very complicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when your number is six, it's almost
impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're basically left with plant a seed,
pray it's female.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe keep one and rotate five.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it gets very complicated quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not productive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't do anything to combat the
things that people that are writing these
[SPEAKER_07]: rules are hoping it will.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to do anything to the
illegal growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to do anything to the smell
of marijuana in neighborhoods from shitty
[SPEAKER_07]: grows with no carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to make life a lot harder
for patients who rely on caregivers for
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine at a price they can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to force them to go to a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to force them to maybe find a
ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that if you've got a
caregiver, what you are reimbursing your
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver compared to what you are paying
at the dispensary is a huge, huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: drastic difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference is massive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost 50%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just the cost to the patient is
50% at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's something that we should think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I've been your caregiver for how
long now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since probably 2010-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give or take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six or seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know your cannabis needs very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched you evolve into a little
dabber lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been kind of neat to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a time saver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can name, I know what strains you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if I walked into my garden,
I'd be like, I got to throw a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: these into the room for Mike, because he's
going to need this in about 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get this ready for him.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay's a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a very good bud tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows you, but how much do you know
about Mike's cannabis needs right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, wait, in my defense,
Mike's never come in the shop before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Mike and I have dabbed in this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming actually that you need
Indica's and CBD's.
[SPEAKER_07]: A variety, but CBD, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Cush Tonic one of your strains?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cush Tonic's one of my favorite greening
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know what.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I mess with it in the daytime,
I'm not going to get that thing done.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's exactly what I needed to do for
me in the evenings.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're wandering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Caregivers are important, damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my point is that I know what Mike
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got flowers pretty much prepared when
Mike needs them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know like, oh shit, I better put that
into flower soon, because Mike got this
[SPEAKER_01]: from me a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means pretty soon his jar is going to
be empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be like, where's my grateful
dog, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to need to have some of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no offense to you, you're not supposed
to know that, but you don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be the one providing his
cannabis if they eliminate me from the
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have to learn all of
these people that do not have a caregiver
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to try to learn their
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to try to have that
product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the grow at Green and Healthy Wellness
supply those flowers that Mike needs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the juicy needs that I need, that you
need, that the people in that room need,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people in that house over there need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we fucking supply those specific
flowers like a caregiver can?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they don't have that many
mother plants and they don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The part of the equation that really
worries me isn't really the part that
[SPEAKER_07]: affects me directly.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the people that use the caregiver
system in Colorado are consuming massive
[SPEAKER_07]: amounts of THC concentrated oil and CBD
concentrated oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the medical or the rec market,
this is going to cost them hundreds of
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars a day per dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you price it out recreational,
several hundred dollars a day per dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two doses a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're looking at 12, 1300 per day in
medication.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the caregiver market with the plant
counts that are under attack right now,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're getting that same dose at the same
quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: If not better, depending on the
production, at a far cheaper price.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pennies on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a caregiver give me a bottle that
was I think 648 milligrams of pure THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that cost me at a recreational
dispenser?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many milligrams?
[SPEAKER_01]: 648.
[SPEAKER_11]: 80, 90 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, way more than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rec you're looking at around 60 to 90 a
gram for good CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was pure CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure CBD tincture you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of MCT oil and THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're still looking at maybe 300
bucks.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We exchanged a 10 pack of seeds for that
tincture because it was a caregiver to
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver transaction for a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, recreationally, that would have
cost a fortune.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For 160 milligrams, you're looking at,
I mean, like 60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure he would have given it to
me if I didn't even offer him the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: pack in exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you get something,
you know, like there was stuff here,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you get stuff for my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the caregiver system is where the
people that really, really need the high
[SPEAKER_07]: quality, high dose medicines, that's where
they get their product.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I have to, I can deal with the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got access to enough cannabis product
selection to keep myself on my feet and
[SPEAKER_07]: healthy enough to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a lot of people who can't
say that in Colorado that rely on
[SPEAKER_07]: caregivers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I don't mind standing up
and doing press or advocacy for
[SPEAKER_07]: caregivers, even though I'm not one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure a lot of people just don't want
to be seen, even though it's more out in
[SPEAKER_11]: the open than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people don't want to be seen
walking in to a dispensary to purchase
[SPEAKER_11]: anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still very much a stigma.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still very much lose your job.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the porn shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing as walking into the
porn shop for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't be seen doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like hope somebody sees me walking in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The porn shop or the dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they stalked you and watched you go,
you know that you're going to go home and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a great day.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that joke.
[SPEAKER_11]: You go to the porn shop and buy your wife
a toy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You get pulled over by the cop and just
posted in that bag, you'll be like,
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I stole this truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely a stigma attached for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still run into it regularly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I run into customers who are from other
states who are like, I can't use the ATM
[SPEAKER_07]: in this building because my bank might
know that this address is where a pot
[SPEAKER_07]: store is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are that paranoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean like a handful a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because in the large parts of the
rest of the country, doing what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing and what we're talking about at this
table will land your ass in jail for an
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly long period of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: These delicious chocolates we were just
eating are like a serious felony in some
[SPEAKER_07]: parts of the US because they're made with
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pass that felony over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pass me that felony.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did 45 days in jail over a pack of
rolling papers one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: In what state?
[SPEAKER_11]: North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rolling papers?
[SPEAKER_09]: No weed, just rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great way to segue.
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't even say you like rolled your
own cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, I said I used it for my underwear so
I didn't get shit stained in my underwear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a little more into the mic for
that because that was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just going to make sure we get this
part.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say it again?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told the cop, I said, well, I use those
for shit so I don't get shit stains in my
[SPEAKER_11]: underwear.
[SPEAKER_11]: It still didn't work.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said in court too, by the way,
it was just really embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_11]: He gave me 45 days in jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: So 45 days of my life was taken away
because of rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember those days though when I was in
band in like seventh grade, they told us
[SPEAKER_07]: to buy rolling papers for something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember what about the
instruments, but the paper specifically
[SPEAKER_07]: was good for something with a read in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's how little I pay attention
to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I remember the speech in class,
they're like, all right, what you're
[SPEAKER_07]: buying now is currently contraband.
[SPEAKER_07]: If law enforcement contacts you about
these, you can explain that it's for your
[SPEAKER_07]: instrument and that hopefully you don't
get a ticket for having what we're telling
[SPEAKER_07]: you to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's still places in the country
that are like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two years ago, I was, you know,
a little over two years now, but two years
[SPEAKER_11]: ago I was in that hell, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was, and I went back about a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a paranoid feeling here now.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: When a cop gets behind me, I could care
less.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got weed on me so fuck it what.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a medical card too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But back home, I mean, you know,
I was that paranoid feeling came back and
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what brought you to Colorado from North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER_01]: This right here is not that feeling,
not having that, not having that fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you came on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you work as a courier for a
company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I work for Stratos.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, we make, uh, THC pills.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, we do medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have, uh, probably the highest dose CBD
probably on the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you say 15 to ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just drop these straight into your
drink and it dissolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the brand new product.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, we don't have the,
the, the brand new ascent on our shelves
[SPEAKER_07]: yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the Stratos pills.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a brand new product on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Six months?
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah, they've been in business for
about a year, but they, uh, they exploded
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere across the state about six
months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, I really like them personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, uh, they're a great low dose
medication option.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, they're CBD products are really
convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're available recreationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Recreationally up to a hundred milligrams
and medically up to 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have three different kinds.
[SPEAKER_11]: The relax is like a, it's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_11]: The energy is the sativa.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have also one asleep that I
don't have because I'm not trying to go to
[SPEAKER_11]: sleep right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: The sleep that's for going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people swear by the bartenders
seem to the sleep.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get more feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just a real heavily activated THC?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are sins.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sitting here and drunk this whole.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just medicated a snap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched him drop it into the sample and
shake it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what you got in there?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: We discussed medicating my Mountain Dew
and decided that was not safe around all
[SPEAKER_07]: this electrical equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may fizz up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Water bottles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, you can medicate
any beverage, any beverage.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it, um, it works like a kind of Alka
Seltzer.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'll look at them, they kind of look
like Alka Seltzer peels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it'll, it'll fizz up and there
is kind of a taste in like a carbonated
[SPEAKER_11]: beverage.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can taste it, but like in this tea and
I've tried it in juice as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not really a real mild flavor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mild for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That a lot of drinks have a heavy flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So an option that I can A medicate
whatever beverage I want without adding
[SPEAKER_07]: tincture, which is always a little weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I do like that sodas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can taste that medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they're also kind of weedy
tasting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, you know, I like my edible,
like these totas right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't have that weedy taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to eat the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to get that THC in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just laughing because I was
halfway through it and I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: damn, Jeff's going to call me out on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, man, Brett really had it right
in the last one when he did like the
[SPEAKER_09]: stretches in the middle of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to you, Brett.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're really killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kills it on Facebook, Brett or on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett posts the greatest shit on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Eva Labs, uh, at Mary's,
you know, he has a fake, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the right one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary's motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the correct Mary's
motivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary's underscore motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's only got two posts, it's the fake
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't follow him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should know how to spell motivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a courier and you get to go to
probably almost half of the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great variety, medical and
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of that makes me real jealous.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a gorgeous state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I would love to spend part of my
day every day driving around it,
[SPEAKER_07]: but after a while, keep in mind it's
September now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here in a couple of weeks, that's going
to turn into an extreme sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have to drive across the fucking
state every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no fun in the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's three months out of the year where
it's okay to drive across the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, the like independent pass is
open right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but they shut that down during the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your social media feeds are, the photos
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we did an episode, you're a
podcast listener, so you probably listened
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the craziest shit that
people have seen in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to all these dispensaries,
I'm sure you've seen something crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you mean crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just something that stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that you'd want to share with a
bunch of people that listen on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you've seen either at a
dispensary or at like a smoke lounge or a
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke event, whatever craziness you've
seen at an industry event or facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me, give me a minute to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause there's, there's a, there's a few
things I'm trying, I got to narrow it
[SPEAKER_11]: down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let you light that joint and think
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's lighting up one of the, he's got
these sativas from Altitude Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine, premium can of cones,
five high grade cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Says there may be health risks associated
with this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kill your cancer and you'll have a
smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_11]: This strain is Ed Rose Super Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Ed Rosenthal Super Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew a dude that grew that for several
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at the, looking, I'm at the
end of the table guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm looking down the table and I see
at least a mainstream cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I mean, different companies,
products, vastly different types of
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just this afternoon, I was reading an
article that was saying Colorado doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: have real legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: There, there are people that are going to
vote against legalization this November,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, because they're worried they won't
make enough money when their state ends up
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly like Colorado is now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe you to vote to risk going
to jail and keeping it the way it is
[SPEAKER_07]: because of something silly like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of scared people that are
afraid of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was a black market grower for far
too long and it's much more comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: having shifted to having this badge around
my neck all the time and knowing that what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing is not shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm actually doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch me all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm doing is where I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much easier that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do run a bit, but they hit pretty
nice for a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they probably just pack a bunch of
cones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've, I've made 900 pre-rolls in a shift
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I feel your pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, a monkey in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's been that monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also make sure that they roll and burn a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a judgemental crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one canute a bit, little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called the first one Usain Bolt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one could have ran the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was running so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just kind of, so, yeah,
sorry altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't mean to just completely bash
your pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I've sold worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've rolled worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely rolled worse too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best is when you're at a concert and
you're like, I'm going to fire up this
[SPEAKER_01]: joint and you light it and it's just
fucking running.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, God damn, I gotta light the
other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that part falls apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this one just did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the guy next to you go from
excited to disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I couldn't smoke any weed the
front row at Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only bad part about the price
you pay for the front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go for a little walk and sneak off by
the trees and smoke you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He shook the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Reggae on the Rocks, I asked a couple
of people, I was like, how's the check?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, they're just going
to patch you down and they let you
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They almost got the gloves out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were taking shit from fucking
everybody at Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were cool about it because they'd
pull your pipe out or pull whatever they
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't find my shit, but they'd pull
it out and they'd be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you the option to take this to
your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not bringing this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you come back, if I find this on
you again, we have to call the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're turning you into the police and
like, and the camera right there and the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera right there just saw you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't fucking do it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the pass at least as long as
you're chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one little chick was like,
take the pass.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just for the record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure the one security guard
lady was a prison guard by day or a prison
[SPEAKER_01]: guard by night and a Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: They stopped fucking around at concert
venues a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, arms up, take your sweater off
your waist, take your hat off.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'm going to touch you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to touch you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to touch you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to check by your dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I grab it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much how they did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a couple of people got injured.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some rocks fell.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Climbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right before that, they'd really
started looking at security and making
[SPEAKER_07]: some improvements inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a completely different place.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first Red Rocks show, I think was Fish
in 95, 69, 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw fish there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was basically a big- Hard to judge
a venue's security from the night fish
[SPEAKER_01]: played.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a giant dirt field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a giant dirt and cactus and fucking
brush fire waiting to happen type of
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we were a hippie wearing sandals,
it was just a big toe fucking damaging
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Red Rocks when I was a teenager
and it wasn't just a concert.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still slightly an adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not into uphill, if you got weak
legs and shitty lungs- Be ready to hike in
[SPEAKER_07]: the heat and then throw that water bottle
away before you enter the venue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of challenged myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm just going to do this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can control my breathing quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got fucking these climber legs
because I'm so tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of leverage, so I can just go
up that hill all day fucking long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just go prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not in fitter in shape.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know that I'm going to get my ass
whipped a little bit before I get to my
[SPEAKER_07]: seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shorts, a t-shirt, a long sleeve shirt,
a rain poncho, a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking place.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent five hours on those stone steps
waiting for the doors to open one day like
[SPEAKER_07]: bacon in the summer sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that once waiting for fish in 95,
but I ate so much acid that I didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just fucking floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now Red Rocks looks like a state park.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all cemented everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the parking is now cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it used to be in 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 96, I snuck over the back of the stage
and watched the Allman Brothers Band from
[SPEAKER_01]: the rocks behind the stage for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I saw somebody up there and I'm
99% sure security fucking climbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I climbed up there and arrested those
motherfuckers and they got like a $10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't do that shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Rocks has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They almost got the glove out and I was
waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, so you're going to get the
glove or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you didn't find what you're looking
for yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got gloves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull it out of your pocket for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this what you need lady?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a blue glove.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the black pH gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did we get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent the longest French show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you think of a crazy dispensary story?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to put them on the spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking it would just come to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me focus.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was listening to you man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were talking about Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been to Red Rocks yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to hit a concert there this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only concerts I've been in Colorado is
the little ones they've had up in the
[SPEAKER_11]: little dab bars up in the springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that Bob.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever been to one of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to the concerts there,
but I've been to plenty of the dab bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got tickets to see Jeff Tate and Emma
Arnold at the dab lounge this Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time this podcast airs,
I think I will have seen that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you should have been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I might be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow night at the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're recording tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the show's at 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get your tickets on a friend of
mine's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link you up with them or just go to
the dab lounge's Facebook page and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tickets are like five bucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to Crested Butte tomorrow,
so we'll see when I get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like seven bucks at the door,
so you're not going to spend too much
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm off tomorrow, so what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a comedian named Jeff Tate and his
friend Emma Arnold, and they are doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: show called Good Cop, Bad Cop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your microphone is getting all wimpy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to fix it, but I need a
screwdriver to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean for it to do that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never done that before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad it can't perform for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor mic stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all embarrassed now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: The strangest dispensary story I probably
have.
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually happened in town.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to say the name of it,
but it's ghetto.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is ghetto.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a, well, I'll probably give it away
right here, but there's a laundromat
[SPEAKER_11]: beside it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we go, two weeks ago, we go birthday
joint shopping because it was my friend's
[SPEAKER_11]: birthday and she was, you know,
some places give you birthday joints for
[SPEAKER_11]: coming in and shopping.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it soul's birthday?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if you listen to the
podcast or not, but happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was her birthday and we went to this
place and start walking up and this guy
[SPEAKER_11]: comes from out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Soul said he come out of the, the
laundromat.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but he just kind of popped
up on us and it just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was nobody in the dispensary,
but him.
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't know anything about any of the
product.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, so, you know, I asked them,
they had some of our product and I said,
[SPEAKER_11]: what do you know about these?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't take bills.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the worst salesman I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not hard to sell a joint.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you come in there for one reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not hard to sell a joint.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can confirm the shit out of that,
but he couldn't sell me ice water if I was
[SPEAKER_11]: thirsty.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, he was awful.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, that's just the most recent
one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure I'll come up with another one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did he even have a badge around his neck?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I didn't even look for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was so unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have left with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just snatched his badge, my badge of
honor, like 50 cent taking someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just smoked a blunt, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't hit blunts very often and
I just took a hit off of a blunt.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have a very rare picture on my
phone of Jeffrey hitting a, a backwood,
[SPEAKER_01]: a big sloppy, drooly funky backwood.
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, he was like moving in the
picture and it's blurry and I don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you can clearly see the backwood.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can clearly see it's him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like, I was trying so hard so fast to
get it because he was like trying to hit
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigfoot accounts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my boy, Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, Adam Hill is sponsored by
backwoods and he smokes a lot of backwoods
[SPEAKER_01]: and he rolled up a big old backwood.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those nasty cigar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he licks them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He licks it up like in school,
like it's the nastiest.
[SPEAKER_09]: He posted a video the other day that was
like, he said something that was like
[SPEAKER_09]: extra saliva or something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: My grandpa, he used to chew them things.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much what Adam does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He chews the end of it while he's smoking
on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he would break a piece off and chew it
in the damn mouth, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grandpa's a damn man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a fucking man right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get a stomach ache thinking
about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't even going to cough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your grandpa's a man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back when men were men and the life
expectancy was like 46.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chew the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I've met people that did that
before that either just nod directly on a
[SPEAKER_07]: backwood or use it as chewing tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've met people that, I don't know how
people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I grew up in tobacco farmland.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm from the Tar Heels.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that was kind of normal.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: He, I'm sure he grew, he raised tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: My mama sit there telling me how she used
to pick it when she was five years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just felt so bad for her because it's
some rough work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm sure he's probably just threw a
whole leaf in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty rugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get really lit up when I smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about that tobacco leaf just
really makes me spin around and get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because you don't smoke tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so you don't, you don't, you don't
smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I barely even smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly just dab is my world lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to be polite and try to have
some fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to politely avoid all of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the cool kids are doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm highly offended that you're not eating
any of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people in the house that are not
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they were offered some of the
strato, they just took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want that, it's over here where you
can reach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is come eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ain't going to peer pressure you
though.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I can get my company to talk to you for
real, if you want to put that in a drink
[SPEAKER_11]: cup this year, I think that's a winner.
[SPEAKER_11]: These won the cannabis cup this year,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys want any of these,
I've got all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dive in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to stop at work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the day off and I had to stop at
work for something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd had people ask me for or ask me if
we carried them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just grabbed both kinds that we
carried and brought them for fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dive in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you try that monkey bar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet, but it's on the do list.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me to say this at all,
but that monkey bar from Incredibles is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my very favorite edibles that's
ever been made.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well then I'll leave a piece here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of edibles in my... How
much did you eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is why I don't do edibles
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've hit this twice, but within a 12-hour
period, I consumed over 2,500 milligrams
[SPEAKER_01]: of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to say anything else,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just taking a break.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't go over like 30 or 40 myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like six or 700 was hard for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when I was going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did 1,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm on the floor, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on the floor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to completely stay still because if
I even move my head a little bit,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm rafting right into a ... See,
I go real light with edibles to 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: 10, I don't really feel.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just, it makes symptom management
significantly better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I like about the Stratos
specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: But other stuff, 30, 25, 30 milligrams is
fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like not fun in public high.
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to go to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2,500, I'd be toasted for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I woke up still high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still high.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I woke up, my eyes, I'm wearing my
iRegenetics logo shirt and this red print
[SPEAKER_01]: is dark, dark red.
[SPEAKER_01]: My eyes were that red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where your brother enjoyed that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Feel free to... You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I might, let's see, man, I can't,
I don't know if I want to... Drop a THC in
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already went one.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I like to eat... I want to watch it
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it looks like... So you can see the
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want y'all to see the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like Alka-Seltzer kind of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you described it as?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll pass those to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to watch this happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to eat the smallest physical thing
with the highest milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like those... Oh, it's very similar to
the Alka-Seltzer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those small gummies, the one gummies that
are a hundred milligrams or that one piece
[SPEAKER_09]: of chocolate, not a bar, a piece of
chocolate that's a hundred milligram,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's me all day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't want to eat a whole bar
and get a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to eat a hundred milligrams real
fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the exact opposite thing about the
five milligram gummies because I can sit
[SPEAKER_07]: there and pop six of them and have that as
like...
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get a really toasted dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually get to chew and enjoy the
edible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of my gripe about edibles is they're
delicious, but now they're the size of
[SPEAKER_07]: your thumb joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you take one tiny little brownie bite
and like, I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I take a tiny bite of a brownie,
most of the rest of my body that's not
[SPEAKER_07]: chewing in that moment starts looking for
more of that fucking brownie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when all of the brownie has weed in
it, that can get dangerous fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's why I like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lower dose stuff, because I can have a
couple of pieces and enjoy it because most
[SPEAKER_07]: of them are insanely good now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a new idea for an edible company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just copy our favorite edibles and
we'll sell those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right alongside those,
we'll sell the same thing without any THC
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been joking about it for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first company that does it well is
going to make a nice change.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that you can just eat these and then
snack the shit out of these.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't there a documentary about one
company that did that already that didn't
[SPEAKER_11]: have a lot of THC?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. J's or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more than one company that does a
larger piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't do it in a multi-pack
successfully.
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to make like a dozen of cookies,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they need to have one packaged in the
front of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that one is a hundred milligrams and
the rest are none.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you eat the one and then you can eat
the rest of them and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you shuffle them and set them on the
table when company comes over.
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only if everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see somebody at the Secret Sash
handed me an edible and I passed it on and
[SPEAKER_01]: they looked completely offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, sorry, I'm on a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just looked at me like,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why'd you give it away?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're giving it back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like right in front of me too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you give it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed it and I was like, Oh no,
wait, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing those drugs anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try and get you to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I'm, I'm just stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a joke to me now that I
haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eating any edible since that time at
Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I ate like 2,500 milligrams and then
I tried to go to work and I was just
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking always eat too many edibles at
Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I swear to God, every time we have the
conversation, like we're not going to eat
[SPEAKER_09]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like the last two times you
followed through on that, obviously the
[SPEAKER_09]: last two times I have not, it was nine 30
at Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, uh, Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris bought me a cookie and I was going
to, I was going to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like eating the cookie.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like nine, like nine 39.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to open the shop the next day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the guy was like, I'm eating it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, yeah, these cookies were
like 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that's what I've been telling
everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, but realistically they might be
like four or I was like, I'm three fourths
[SPEAKER_09]: of weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's cooking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I'm going to finish it now
because like, yeah, it doesn't matter now,
[SPEAKER_09]: but like, man, I wish I would have known
that before I started eating it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I would have only eaten a quarter or
half.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things I like about the rec
market over the med.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's not a lot on that list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but the, the, the dosing and the lab
testing to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming to the medical scene very
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be there in, um, less than a year
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I heard November, I, it was
supposed to be July and then they said
[SPEAKER_01]: November.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to build the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're creating this from the ground up,
which is like why we're joking about like
[SPEAKER_07]: different models for edible companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if we're really watching it happen in
front of us, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the honor of, uh, giving Lindsay and
her better half, uh, Mr. Bobo blaster Co a
[SPEAKER_01]: ride home from the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew you were going to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little nappy had the back of the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, that cookie killed me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Second of all, it was the cookie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeff wanted to do a podcast on the way
home and I was totally down to do a
[SPEAKER_09]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we were all smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I had said that I was going to
wait to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've said, no, I don't want to do a
dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris thought I said that I was going to
wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently we're all waiting for me to
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: I fell asleep in the back of the car.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I woke up and I was like,
all right, I'm going to keep eating so
[SPEAKER_09]: that I will stay awake.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Chris started trolling.
[SPEAKER_09]: You both started trolling me about how
much I was eating in the back of the car.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can do your own goddamn podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, Chris and I were talking to her
and she was just blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: No answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she goes, why are you guys
picking on me?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, that's like five minutes
ago, Lindsay, like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has said anything to her for like
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, I'm not even asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then where's the torch?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, it's on the floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was totally passed out in the
back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but Chris always makes fun of me
for sleeping everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I always try to be like, I'm not asleep
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was swamped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people could just sleep in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I drive everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Davin Granny for coming to
the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davin with Davin.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got so much enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does she wear a shirt that says Davin
Granny?
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't need a shirt that says Davin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well that'd make her official,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, she doesn't even, I mean, she's- It's
already there.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's just her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got more Instagram followers than
all of us combined.
Literally.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's got like, I think the last time I
checked it was like 156 or 157,000.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because I was listening to the
last podcast and she was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh yeah, I just hit 151.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, damn, I think she's at 157
already.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for just a little over an
hour, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay just said something that made me think
about something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want more people to follow you on
Instagram, you can tell everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: listening right now how they can stalk
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say it right into the top of the mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I am on Instagram, but I don't have
it on my phone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or on social media.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I said I was protesting them,
but I do have, I got Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can anybody stalk you if they want
to check you out while they're listening
[SPEAKER_01]: to your sexy voice?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go to, well, my Facebook private.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold up a minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, I don't- I have a Twitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them about Twitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll stalk you on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see what my name is on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, use the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tweet that at him, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm at chicken fish.
[SPEAKER_11]: C-H-I-C-K-E-N-P-H-I-S-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicken fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicken fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow him on Twitter, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send him some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag I like it when he rambled toward
this guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my handle when I was driving a
truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a fish with the band fish or just
happened to have a pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're a fish fan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, why didn't we just start the podcast
like that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you was talking about- I've been to
a couple of shows back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your favorite show?
[SPEAKER_01]: What year, what era?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stumped him.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw a bunch of 99 shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that really was funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard of them and I knew that I was
down for the Z song.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, swimming around in the fish tank.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the vacuum cleaner.
[SPEAKER_11]: But back in the 90s, I couldn't just go to
a touring site and grab the whole catalog
[SPEAKER_11]: of some band that I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's too easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids are spoiled nowadays.
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend won tickets.
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend won tickets to the fish show the
next day on the radio.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was like the 10th caller or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I heard it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually heard it on the radio.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went over.
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have pay phones back then.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went there, called him up and said,
hey, you're taking me to the fish concert.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, I know that one song.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that one song.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't play it by the way,
but I knew that one song.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was prepared to sing along with them,
but they didn't play it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But everything they did play, I kind of
dug.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to see fish, do not expect to
hear your favorite song.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, after I got into them, I went and
seen them again in Charleston,
[SPEAKER_11]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go all the way up there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not Charleston.
[SPEAKER_11]: Charlottesville, where the University of
Virginia is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I felt like the old guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an older couple behind me,
but I somehow felt older than they was.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the one thing, my wife with me,
went with me this time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to you, baby, Santana Odell.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring her next time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.
[SPEAKER_11]: She wanted to come this time, but she had
some things she had to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I told her about, you know,
as soon as I went to the one at Winston
[SPEAKER_11]: Salem, North Carolina, the first one,
as soon as the lights went out,
[SPEAKER_11]: joints lit up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, fuck yeah, my buddy didn't
smoke, but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked over here and I see a 14 year old
kid sitting there fucking cheap.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, yo, man, let me hit that knee.
[SPEAKER_11]: He gave me the whole joint fired up
another one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: 14 too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I kind of felt obligated.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I was above age.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't 21, but I was 19, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I felt obligated to take it from a 14
year old kid smoking a Grunner.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: But he pulled out another one.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he had me trumped.
[SPEAKER_11]: My buddy didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he wouldn't let me bring no weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I come prepared the second
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I told my wife, I'm like, as soon as
these lights go out, you about to see
[SPEAKER_11]: something.
[SPEAKER_11]: You see all the joints fired up and she's
like, oh yeah, I can dig this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, I've seen all the people
dancing around.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told her all about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: She tripped out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to go see them again out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be here this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best, doing my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these tickets sold out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's sold the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you got a lot of money,
you're going to have too much damn money.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an eight pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, get a huge package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably looking close to 200 bucks
one night per person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing three nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just put his head down in defeat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they come once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come once a year.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come to Colorado once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't they usually hit dicks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they're at this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The giant soccer field, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell out that giant soccer field
three nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never miss a Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast, it'll come out the Monday
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you guys are listening to this,
I'm probably hanging out with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday, I got the Jeff Tate thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday, Saturday, Sunday is fish at dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Monday, Doug Benson at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll dab him out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug's my homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucked him up one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me out on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you got me too high,
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wrecked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrecked him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse my coughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Sizzla Kalanji at Cervantes,
September 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a Rasta, if you're into that
reggae.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado's getting awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just continuous now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen Sizzla.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty excited for that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember a time here when you had a few
good concerts at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_07]: summer and a few good concerts at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no concerts.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no concerts during the not
beginning or end of summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't those two, like three week
sections of time, there wasn't anything
[SPEAKER_07]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dirty fish kid in me used to just pack
up the car and go where the concerts were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it's continuous here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've always got something going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever been to Telluride?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been to almost everything
but the Telluride Blues Fest and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluegrass Fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm up there like every other Friday,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: They always got something going on up
there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That little mountain town stays busy.
[SPEAKER_11]: The town is awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just the view.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been up there once and it was an
amazing time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would play the lottery just to win
something so I could buy a house up there
[SPEAKER_11]: and just tell everybody to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you've got an extra house in Telluride
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're cool as fuck and you're tired
of it, my buddy Juicy J will trade you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got two packs of pre-rolls and a spot
exit bag.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we could donate pretty much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a gram.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll throw one gram of hash in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Donate the whole table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email can go too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get Juicy J a spot up in Telluride
so that he can get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to have five rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five rooms in Telluride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone looking to donate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because everybody's going to want to come
and visit with me and I can rent one room
[SPEAKER_11]: out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get behind this dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: GirlFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to take your offers for free
housing in Telluride.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bunch of spots in Colorado like
that that are just kind of awesome now all
[SPEAKER_07]: the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They used to be very much seasonal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think people will just give you a
house?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that'll work?
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change of things have happened this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you weren't married, I was going to be
like, he needs a sugar mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is my sugar mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Lindsay, it's time for you to
do your plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell all the people that are still
listening how they can find you on all the
[SPEAKER_09]: social media.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Instagram and my Periscope are the
Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I almost fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just say LOL like that loud?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I say that all the time actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Instagram, my Periscope are the
Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Twitter is the Travel Stoner.
[SPEAKER_09]: My Snapchat is Traveling Stoner without
the G.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's everything actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, where do I go?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I actually started out in Jersey and
moved down to Florida.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out here in Colorado and I kind of
just like travel everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many states you've been in?
[SPEAKER_09]: How many states have I actually been in?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, I haven't like actually done a
count since I came out and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to do a recount and think of
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've smoked a joint in 48 states.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is impressive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very respectful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've even snuck over into Mexico,
but that's probably for a later podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty long.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I've smoked a joint in Mexico,
snuck over in a limousine, smoked a joint
[SPEAKER_11]: in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a limousine, can you say snuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would going further be a bad legal choice?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just love that part.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard snuck and then I heard limousine
and I just smiled really big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike kind of follows the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get you in trouble,
but on the other hand, I really want to
[SPEAKER_07]: hear the rest of that story.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, like I said, it's a pretty long
story.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be part two.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to make sure everybody's cool with
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets pretty vulgar at times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can handle this at a later episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a whole other show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just got jotted down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the odds of it happening just went up
to like 65%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a future episode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was loving to hear your 65.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to give a big shout out though
to like in the past couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been on the podcast a lot these past
couple of months actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have had a lot of people message me
about the podcast and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: great podcast, you know, listen to it this
morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the day it drops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like by 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_09]: there's usually one person that has
messaged me and said already listened to
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to give a big shout out to
everybody that has been listening and
[SPEAKER_09]: messaging me to say that the podcast has
been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Linz for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you and granny and Brett have been
on the show frequently, the listens have
[SPEAKER_01]: gone up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram and Twitter followers have
gone up on all of the accounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Rasta Jeff, the iRegenetics and the
GFYH account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your social media skills are fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you're killing it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all those people that message
Lindsay and don't message me for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to all you guys for listening
to the show and participating with Linz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I get so many messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep messaging her.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send me a message,
I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I owe a huge shout out to that one
mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She messages me and tells me how great the
episode is before I wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: She Snapchats it almost every Monday
morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like getting ready and it's like the
girl from the heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can hear it in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: She should be in the bathtub or she'll be
taking her morning dabs or on her morning
[SPEAKER_01]: hike or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you, girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name's that one mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think her Snapchat is mountain smokes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I couldn't find her today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then her Instagram is that one
mountain girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: But shout out to you, girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're doing good in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody, if you're listening to the
show, we've been going for an hour and 18
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means with the intro I put on this,
we're probably about an hour and 20
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love all the people that listen this
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging out at the table with
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put new light bulbs in the chandelier
and it's all bright and shiny in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whole new place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It woke up the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made everybody a little more talkative.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Mike for coming,
taking time away from his dinner,

dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming and hanging out.

bro, because you got good stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be here often taking dabs
with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your wife next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your wife's kind of a local celebrity out
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_11]: She thinks she's a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to show her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I edit that out?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

and I wish you nothing but the best on
[SPEAKER_01]: your new endeavors, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're going to wrap up this

room that don't have microphones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: just been hanging out smoking blunts with

show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I'll be right back to put a
tail on this fishy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I really just say put a tail on this
fish?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, thanks for listening to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you have a product you'd like
to review, or if you'd like to sponsor the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a girlfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Mike, big shout out to
Juicy J, big shout out to Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to everybody that was in the room
smoking blunts and having a good time with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were taking dabs and smoking blunts
off Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun having extra people in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kept it a little chaotic, kept things
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get off the microphone and
quit talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been like an hour and 20 minute
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So catch me in about seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
And
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Ben Verbeck was an opening
comedian up at the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did their good cop, bad cop comedy
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hang out with Jeff Tate and Emma
Arnold, and they treated me like a rock
[SPEAKER_01]: star.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Jeff Tate several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first time meeting Emma
Arnold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Jeff Tate several times with
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So him and I have become comfortable with
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has recently become a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has made the switch from alcohol to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold do
some comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben Verbeck opened the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another guy whose name has left my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew his name until right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy went on second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Emma Arnold went on and her set
was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Jeff Tate went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a comedy set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then toward the end of his standup
routine, he said, I'm going to light this
[SPEAKER_01]: joint and start smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point in this comedy show,
I'm going to become too high to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: doing standup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he lit his joint and he kept doing
his bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at some point he obviously got
too high and he said thanks and walked off
[SPEAKER_01]: the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday, I took the night off, got some
rest, hung out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday and Sunday, we went to Denver and
I saw my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite band is Fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Fish at the Dick's Sporting Goods
Arena Stadium, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: a gigantic, big-ass soccer field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw Fish there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three nights were sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he did not have tickets, it was a
challenge getting tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lucky I got into that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, Fish was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Played some of my favorite songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played a really amazing version of a
song called Maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played Tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Played some great, great music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safe drive, which was great because it was
a busy holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday morning, we had back up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get some food up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got to see Doug Benson at the
Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite podcasts is the Doug
Loves Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to see Doug Benson joined once
again by his friends, Jeff Tate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Emma Arnold and also a guy named Trey
Galleon joined them for the Doug Loves
[SPEAKER_01]: Movies taping at Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I got to hang out for that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Baker for
getting me front row all the time at
[SPEAKER_01]: Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great taping, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest that you listen to the Denver
show of Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this podcast comes out,
that will be out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great podcast, Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this podcast,
you have access to Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see live taping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the podcast taping,
we're all hanging outside in the alley
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking because Doug and his friends love
to come and just smoke out with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made friends with Trey Galleon almost
instantly, like instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy and I are homies now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be friends for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I left, all four of the comedians
were standing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, hey, you guys, it means a lot
to me that you come and do comedy because
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy is super important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all like sincerely felt my
thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of cool to see all four
of their faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, holy shit, we made this dude's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my weekend, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bunch of good comedy, a whole
bunch of good music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ben Verbeck from the Dab
Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Dab Lounge in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, huge shout outs to Emma Arnold,
Jeff Tate, Trey Galleon, Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also shout out to Fish and my fishing
buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a grow update.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a grow update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that's been listening to the
show knows that I've been working on a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one light with a very small
breeding project happening in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other day I went in there and pulled
out the male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I collected a little bit of pollen from
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I hosed myself down with a
good shower because I don't want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the male plant is out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant has dropped his pollen and he
is now gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are five Arise female types.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are number four, number five,
number seven, number eight, and then one
[SPEAKER_01]: that was labeled E.
[SPEAKER_01]: E was the remaining phenotype from another
phenohunt that I liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: E has been around for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: E is the Arise that you see a lot of
pictures of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones are really good competitors
that have great traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got those five female phenotypes
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one golden goat, one grateful dog,
one lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are females in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are eight females.
[SPEAKER_01]: That have all been pollinated by this one
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are currently 40 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been about 25 days since pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've still got probably 20 to 30 days
before I can harvest these plants and the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently the seeds are visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the pollen worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants took the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're seeded now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're developing nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other day I grabbed a bottom bud
and just pinched one of the seeds out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're white still, but they are starting
to develop an embryo inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shells are getting a little bit hard,
but they are still white.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste weird also if you're curious,
but they're not quite ready yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still got a little ways to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're ready, my plan is to let
them go until those seeds are really well
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to cut down each plant
and label each plant very carefully as to
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will hang each plant in its own area
with a bowl underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if a seed does fall out,
I'll catch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you guys, I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use a drum head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put the drum head upside down,
put it underneath each plant so that if a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed falls out, it lands in the drum head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once they dry, I will take each plant
individually and crush it up into probably
[SPEAKER_01]: a Tupperware dish and just like,
I'll take off the fan leaves and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the buds will get just like hand
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to roll joints and then
I'll just, all the seeds will fall out at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull out all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll jar them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll label them as to which phenotype that
is, like a rise F2, like it'll be a rise
[SPEAKER_01]: five F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise seven F2, whatever plant it comes
from, I'll make sure it's labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to grow a bunch of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of my friends are going to grow a
bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to see which arise
phenotypes I want to continue breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see if this golden goat,
the grateful dog and lemon skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll see if they do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stabilize this arise a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is actually in the long run to
take this arise all the way to F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will take me a couple of years,
probably two more years, maybe three more
[SPEAKER_01]: years to get it there, depending on how
selection goes, depending on how stubborn
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, depending on what the F2s and F3s
show me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my breeding update, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you guys sticking around for
the breeding updates with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions on my breeding
project, please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to answer your questions
about my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into some listener emails and
this will segue me into the reverting and
[SPEAKER_01]: revegging topic that I teased about at the
top of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a bunch of great messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came on Instagram and this was
actually, this guy had no idea that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to use this as podcast content.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a personal conversation between
him and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to call this the
seeded herb question, email number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy says, quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled off almost all the fan leaves on
an early flowering strawberry cough plant
[SPEAKER_01]: from Sagamarta seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was at five to six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the strawberry cough plant threw
bananas before I saw them because I have
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and all the plants fully mature now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only plant that had bananas was
the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he says he saw bananas,
he means that he saw male flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: developing on his female plants,
which means that this female was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: a hermaphrodite or it was stressed and it
caused it to panic and cause male flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it could try to keep itself alive
by making more seeds and then continuing
[SPEAKER_01]: its generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he continues with another message.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, will these banana pollen seeds
make mostly plants that have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_01]: toss bananas easily or at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the thing is the main thing here,
we don't know why that strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_01]: plant threw those bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know why it hermaphrodited out on
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if it's a herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if it's got herm traits in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if it's one of its parents
was a herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if that specific trait or
phenotype is a herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know why that plant threw
bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that would have caused it to throw
bananas would have been a light leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant, some things I've seen,
light comes in through your ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you're ducting those hooded
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got ducting running.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're running it out the window or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light comes reflecting into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant that is right underneath
that reflector, I've seen those
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite because they are getting hit
with light leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that could cause that plant
to hermaphrodite could be heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing could be over-nutrienting
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much nitrogen toward the end of flower
could absolutely cause a plant to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too dry, too moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any kind of weird interruption on some
strains can cause them to herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the main question is, did that
plant herm because it's a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_01]: itself or was it an environmental factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, it's herming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something it's going to
hermaphrodite on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something I would keep in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go ahead and get rid of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the seeds that come out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have something else to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that every plant that is now
mature has seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me think that you could have a
light leak in there and all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants all produce seeds because of light
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only that strawberry cough showed the
hermaphrodite flowers just because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a phenotypical thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones may not have shown you the
hermaphrodite flowers, but they could have
[SPEAKER_01]: seeded on their own just from being
stressed, even if you didn't see flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that strawberry cough is the
only one that you actually noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers, maybe it produced them to
where you could see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That all could have been seeded by that
rogue hermaphrodite strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that strawberry cough is a
hermaphrodite, you may have created some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may grow some great phenotypes,
but you may also run into a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing could be true if you got
your seeds from stressing those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: from light stress or from overfeeding or
from underfeeding or for overwatering,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever caused that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have produced some amazing
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also may have produced a bunch of
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main piece of advice is don't share
those seeds with anybody until you've ran
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of them yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do give them out,
make sure people know that they do have a
[SPEAKER_01]: tendency or at least a likelihood to have
some hermaphrodite traits in there because
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't want people wasting their time
growing herms when they can be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy that sent me this message,
you have produced some quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just stick to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, my throat's burning out for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously need a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was taking a drink and a couple of
dabs, something dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our listener in his message said that his
plant was an early flowering strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cough plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that phrase early flowering indicates
a couple of things to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that plant flowered more
quickly than the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did it show flowers at like day 10
when the other plants waited till day 14
[SPEAKER_01]: or 15?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did it flower on its own while it was
in under veg lights under 18 or 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: of light?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you mean by early
flowering, but that says something to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant that wants to auto flower like
that is probably a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's trying to flower early is
because a male plant wants to get up above
[SPEAKER_01]: the female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows a little taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to get up above the female plants
and it wants to start dropping pollen so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's already spitting out pollen by
the time those females are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plant's whole goal in life is
to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant is probably a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to get taller than everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to flower first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to have pollen falling before all
of those females are ready so that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over there at the party set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already got a beer in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just waiting for the chicks to show
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would not use that plant for growing
or breeding anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds that you made are probably
produced from a hermaphrodite plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see some hermaphroditic
tendencies in that progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't give those out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would grow those myself and pay very
close attention to what happens to those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever have any more questions,
send them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will use more of your stuff on the
podcast because you have some great
[SPEAKER_01]: questions because you're an advanced
grower and I like where you're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say your name on the show,
but you know who I'm talking to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings us to our next email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit of an update.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few episodes ago, I was sent an email
about monster cropping and I told the dude
[SPEAKER_01]: that I wasn't sure what he meant about
monster cropping because when I Googled
[SPEAKER_01]: it, there were a ton of different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked him for more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has replied, this is what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Hey bro, when I was asking about
monster cropping, I was meaning when you
[SPEAKER_01]: take a cut off a female plant,
that's about three weeks in bloom and
[SPEAKER_01]: re-veg her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a buddy telling me about this last
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that the clone goes crazy making
shoots and there's no need to top her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming you were re-vegging the
clone that you're taking and you were
[SPEAKER_01]: letting that plant flower and finish out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a decent idea if you're
taking that clone from near the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, if you're not taking it off of
the top because you don't want to disrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowering tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of seems like it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of also seems like it could be a
way waste of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the amount of time you've got a plant
that's three weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already starting to show little buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hormones have converted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to make buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you need to take that clone and get it
in the cloner or in the dome, however you
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be under 24 hours of light and
you have to revert that plant all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: back to a vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to veg it to the size that
you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can flower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I wouldn't even flower out
that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it started getting healthy and
re-vegging and spitting out proper shoots,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take clones of that and turn those
clones into a mother plant and then start
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of seems like a lot of work for
just a plant with some extra shoots to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the amount of time that you're
re-vegging to develop those shoots,
[SPEAKER_01]: to re-veg it, to get it healthy,
I could probably just cut another clone
[SPEAKER_01]: and make a happy plant by topping and
shaping and pruning and making the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: the size and shape I wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like kind of a waste of time in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to knock anybody's method
because they may have a purpose for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be working for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I bet you in the amount of time you're
spending re-vegging, I could probably just
[SPEAKER_01]: cut clones and do things the simple way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top it, train it, get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you told me what monster cropping
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody else out there has tried
monster cropping, send me a message,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know more info about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how it goes for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been talking about re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did kind of bash it and say that it's
sort of a waste of time, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: times when re-vegging is a very useful
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are reasons to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you forgot to take a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always talk about when you grow from
seed, make sure you take clones because
[SPEAKER_01]: you may grow the best you've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have a clone,
you're going to be angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you didn't take a clone of that
plant, re-vegging is always an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe you're like me, maybe you did
take a shit son of clones and maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked up and maybe all your clones died.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you don't have any clones of that
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has happened to me before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe you're even more like me and my
friend Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you grow too many seeds and you
don't even have any room left to take more
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your only option is to revert those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are reasons why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about
re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Re-vegging is actually when you have
flowered out a cannabis plant and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to return it back to its vegetative state
so you can start fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, like I said before, I would return
that plant back to a veg state and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: take clones from it and then use those
clones as my new mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't try to flower that one back
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels to me like you would just kind of
wear that plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it, but it's going to stress
that plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to get weaker as it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't guarantee that, but I wouldn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take, I would re-veg it and then
try to take a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like your second chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully your clones live this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you don't kill them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you remember to take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to re-veg your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something really helpful that will really
speed up your re-vegging process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this sounds crazy, but this will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you begin to flush, approximately 10
to 14 days before harvest time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I fully recommend that you turn your
lights back on to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more 12.12.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them on for 18 hours and off for
six hours a day for the last 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_01]: of your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while you're flushing, change the timer
back to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That two week period isn't enough time to
revert those plants back to veg since they
[SPEAKER_01]: are so far along in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may see some of the buds start to
try to revert, just harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harvest time anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cutting those plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 10 to 14 days before harvest
time, put your timer back on to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your veg schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it back on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll get the plant sped up back into
the re-veg phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut your plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're harvesting, leave the bottom
three buds on the bottom branches of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a single stock plant,
if you did not top, if you've got a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: with one stock coming up, there's a little
intersection where it makes a peace sign,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the main stock going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a branch coming off the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a branch coming off the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up the left branch and up the right
branch, there will be little buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave those buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to leave the bottom three buds on
those bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the bottom of the plant up,
find the bottom ones and then go one,
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave those three buds and harvest
everything else on the bottom two
[SPEAKER_01]: branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you topped it, you've got four
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: On those bottom four, leave the bottom
three buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're going to revert into a
vegetative plant and start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you've harvested the plant,
move it to a room with 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either use a T5, you can use a
metal halide, or you can use an LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more light you use, the more quickly
your plant will return back to a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative stage and you can start taking
clones from it and then use one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: clones as a new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg that one out and then take clones from
that and those clones can be your next
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you've now solved the problem
of a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've fixed the hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gotten it back to the way it should
be as a vegetative plant and you're right
[SPEAKER_01]: back where you began.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I should mention is while you're
waiting for your plant to revert,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should feed it with kelp and
vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use your basic veg newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: More nitrogen will help speed up the
process, but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to speed up this process,
there is one thing that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add 200 particles per minute
million of GA3, that's gibberellic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: to your feed and it will really speed up
the reverting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, earlier I talked about taking that
flowering plant and reverting it back to
[SPEAKER_01]: veg and then taking a clone from that and
using that clone as your new mother and
[SPEAKER_01]: then cutting clones from that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use the gibberellic acid,
I feel like you can take that plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: was flowering and you can revert it and
then take clones from it and those clones
[SPEAKER_01]: will be completely fine to work with with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep one of those as your mother plant,
flower out the rest of them and you were
[SPEAKER_01]: back on track with vegetative plants and a
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not lose your strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can grow that strain forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you take clones from here on
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you do reveging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I hope you learned a lot from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Colin from the Ethos Collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you support the Ethos

[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bees collecting male cannabis pollen and
turning that into honey, but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely not like weed honey as
advertised.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very cool marketing ploy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very cool video, but I think it is
inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's misleading and I don't think
you're getting THC honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be somebody said earlier,
they ain't going to do it on the honor
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to watch them make this honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to watch the bees do their
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to take that honey to a
lab and let Steep Hill test that honey for
[SPEAKER_01]: me and see what type of cannabinoids are
in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what I was thinking when we
were kind of talking about this before the
[SPEAKER_07]: show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is for that to happen, we would have to
bring this little homie to Colorado with
[SPEAKER_07]: his bees and his cannabis plants,
because that's the only place on the
[SPEAKER_07]: planet where we could really collect and
lab test that in a controlled way without
[SPEAKER_07]: him going to jail immediately after.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he can do it in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's just a border jump away,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain's homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked at him for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Spain cares because they
have spannibus and there's a hillside in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad that I can't remember the name
of the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a small region in Spain where
they do not care about cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might have the ability to grow,
but do they have the access to the same
[SPEAKER_07]: testing kind of labs that we do?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because both in the same area are one of
the things that make Colorado's cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: market so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to test your bees.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've heard about the dude on a mildly
related note, the dude in Oregon that's
[SPEAKER_07]: doing the hogs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: He, you know how here the waste from the
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do specific stuff with it so
it doesn't end up in a teenager's hands or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever out of your dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be ground up into little
tiny pieces, run through a wood chipper
[SPEAKER_01]: and then mixed with other product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A shop up in Oregon found a hog farmer to
take care of a farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they take all that plant material
and I'm not exactly sure what the farmer
[SPEAKER_07]: does to it between picking it up from the
shop and dropping it off with the pigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm assuming it's not much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they chat out on that as a primary
food source for most of their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado Springs has a deal worked out
[SPEAKER_01]: with the very well-known vape pen company,
Openn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow their products in their
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They chop down their plants and the waste
from their plants is then it's mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: properly so that it's a MED compliant and
the MED has approved this transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send all of the waste to the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company and the Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Worm Company feeds that back to
their worms and the worms compost that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
in turn sells their worm castings at a
[SPEAKER_01]: discount back to Openn Vapes Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's getting reused and refed back to
the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of keeping it a little more
eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to learn as growers, as
professional responsible growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is time to figure out how to reduce our
carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to do that very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of the places, the laws around
cannabis make that specific topic
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly brutal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Boulder, I think they have to run solar
to offset all of their electricity or
[SPEAKER_01]: something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They passed a law in Boulder saying
marijuana businesses had to be a hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: percent energy neutral, which means they
can't consume any power they don't
[SPEAKER_07]: generate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And immediately after passing that law,
they realized how unenforceable or not
[SPEAKER_07]: unenforceable, but unfeasible it was to
require that immediately.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they've been given some time to
upgrade, but it's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_07]: made Pueblo so popular is that we allow
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver does not allow greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boulder does not allow greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the prime greenhouse area
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect greenhouse country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful country here to grow
cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: We designated a whole bunch of water,
just kind of set it aside for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's all we'll lease to
marijuana grows at the beginning of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've barely touched that number.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a ton of that still kind of in
reserve, even with the industry as big as
[SPEAKER_07]: it is down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the hardest things to do is
to get the water rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get something set up,
you have to get a water lawyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something nobody thought of until
about a year and a half, two years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: when we finally finished the rules and
regs process.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just hammer out a well and go to
town down here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a lot of rules when it comes to
water here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they know, they know the big
commercial grows are coming and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: use up the water and they want to keep it
for you and I to drink, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a good water plan down here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all that's taken care of the,
it's one of the more recent anti pot
[SPEAKER_07]: talking points is how much water the plant
drinks or how much energy growing and
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, you know,
if you didn't prohibit it in 46 of the 50
[SPEAKER_07]: states, more of it would be grown under
the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be using significantly less power to
produce all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could just grow it outdoors like a
normal crop, but oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do we vote on the city elections for
200 and 300?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the presidential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So November, November, November 8th,
we will put out a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making a note.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do an election podcast at some point
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to guide people on what to vote on
locally, but very specifically we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: that in a whole nother show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a little segment on it just for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the date today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is today the ninth today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the ninth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yesterday was the last day for people
to submit ballot issue paperwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the final election ballots,
they're all hammering out that paperwork
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have all the final information.
[SPEAKER_07]: For November here in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do an episode to teach you guys
locally what to vote for because the
[SPEAKER_01]: wording is confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be, it's more,
way more than one question.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just via yes or no vote yes for
weed vote no against weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be much more complicated
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this episode, I want to put this back
on some, some edumacational topics on the
[SPEAKER_01]: rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, back on some rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's had a headache and he took a couple
of dabs of CBD when I got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a, really his color came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that the headache has kind of
gone away a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feeling better, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm feeling a lot better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the proper containers?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got three of them that look alike.
[SPEAKER_07]: The product I'm consuming right now is 3%
THC, 1.3% CBD, 38.99% CBDA and 36.32% THCA
[SPEAKER_07]: and an additional 6% CBG.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this has got a bizarrely wide range of
cannabinoids in it and really get on
[SPEAKER_07]: headaches amongst other things,
pain and inflammation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of hash would you call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of?
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends what temperature it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's intended as a shatter at about 65
degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pretty nice shatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It shatters real nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 70.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really sticky taffy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you take two pieces and you pull it
apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of stretches.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched you try to get a dab out of
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be a little tricky to get a dab out
of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It, it above like 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what he's talking about is a smokable
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some hash, some shatter with a pretty
good CBD to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tell Mike was hurting about 20
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a pretty good headache and he took
two dabs of that and then put on his
[SPEAKER_01]: headphones like, all right, dude,
let's record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CBD definitely reduced the pain in
your headache and it improved your
[SPEAKER_01]: attitude because of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel a hundred percent better now that
I've put something that's half and half
[SPEAKER_07]: THC CBD into my system for the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: My knees feel better.
[SPEAKER_07]: My neck, the tension in my neck feels
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a wicked headache when I got here,
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, we're sitting at the table kind of
catching up and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm basically just staring at the
table, rubbing my eyes and my temples
[SPEAKER_07]: cause it hurts so bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking I might not podcast and I
might just have to bail after a dab or two
[SPEAKER_07]: and go home cause I'm hurting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the addition of some CBD into my world
has reset that completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been a big fan of CBD for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for what ails you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I, and I've said it on the
show, I'm not a huge smoker of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use a lot of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke, I prefer a nice THC head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make my head spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get talkative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a good sativa does to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke too much CBD, I honestly just
get lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of ruins my high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not stoned right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, I took four knobs,
all THC dabs here a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a nice little buzz going on,
but right before the show, I didn't want
[SPEAKER_07]: my headache to come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I took two more half and half THC CBD
dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it, it brought me my high back down to
like a two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking about dabbing some clementine
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some pineapple jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a dab of that, feel free to
reach in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pull this piece off right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For myself, but here's some shatter piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like six of my dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a flag.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does look like kind of like a flag.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had a model train, that dab would
be American flag size.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably about 0.3 ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I don't use a lot of CBD products,
but one time listeners of this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: will know over a year ago in April of
2015, CBD lube incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, when I hit my head, I hit my head
in April and I was having issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head hurt for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, my head was throbbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a traumatic brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have post-concussion syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of, it's been over 18 months
and I still have effects from that
[SPEAKER_01]: concussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knocked myself clean the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out for a good 30 to 45 seconds,
like unconscious on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: People had to pick me up, get me going
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head hurt for several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not get right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I took a dab of- No, you weren't
yourself for six weeks after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't myself for six months after
it felt like to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a substantial improvement after
about six weeks, but I mean, it took half
[SPEAKER_07]: a year before you were feeling like
yourself all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so Spencer would invite me over just
to check on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be like, bro, come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come kick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been like, you could tell I was
getting depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when you hit your head and have a
traumatic brain injury, you get depressed
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're not the same that you used to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: My skills weren't where they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was bummed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friends really hanging out,
trying to help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all my friends that helped me
through that head injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Spence would invite me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one night he's like, bro, I made some
CBD hash oil for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shit actually won the best CBD
concentrate at the high times cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he gave me a big fat dab of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, dog hit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when I would smoke normal shatter
like THC or sativas, my head would throb
[SPEAKER_01]: even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be like, and I could feel
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt like I had, it felt like I had
a belt around my head or like my hat was
[SPEAKER_01]: way too tight is what it felt like all
day, every day for a couple, for like
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Spence gives me these CBD dabs and I
breathed in with the dab and I blew out
[SPEAKER_01]: that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt like you just undid that belt
about one notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't like fix it, but it totally
undid that belt a notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maddie and Spence looked at me and
they go, wow, did that help?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, how could you tell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you sat up, your neck went
straight again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you've been like slouching weird
and you've been like crooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, let me get another
dab like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after like three or four of those CBD
dabs, I was like, I haven't felt this good
[SPEAKER_01]: since before I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it really did something to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they gave me some of that stuff and
they like dab this, like dab it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got me, it really did help.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found a good half THC half CBD mix
about, oh, maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really hard to come by back
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've got a lot of inflammation in like
my knees and my neck where it's just for
[SPEAKER_07]: one stupid medical reason or another,
the bones grind on each other and then the
[SPEAKER_07]: tissue gets swollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like 6'4", right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably weigh a good 230,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike's probably 250ish over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing by that reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right about 200 pounds most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These knees, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, our knees get, there's so much
leverage going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many times have you stood up into like
a heating duct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just cramped your neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I busted my head, I really jerked my
neck back like completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been in car accidents.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of fun stuff here that you
can tumble down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cartwheels with skis unreleasing on my
feet was one of the really fun ones that
[SPEAKER_07]: led to no cartilage in either knee.
[SPEAKER_07]: I rode bicycles as a kid in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the end result, all this trauma over
the years of having fun in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_07]: that there's a lot of inflammation and a
lot of swelling in places that press on
[SPEAKER_07]: nerves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that causes phantom nerve pain or
basically the same stuff amputees get when
[SPEAKER_07]: like they lose a finger and then the
finger tingles or hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those nerves create or make up or feel
that they're getting signals they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: really getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can feel like it's tingling or
tickling, or it can feel like it's on fire
[SPEAKER_07]: or stuck in a car door or it'll go numb.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I first stumbled on medical
marijuana, that was one of the things I
[SPEAKER_07]: liked is it would help me ignore that
sensation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't until I found something that
was a good ratio with THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_07]: that I really started to attack that
inflammation and bring it down to a point
[SPEAKER_07]: where it doesn't hurt anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's hard to explain to somebody when
you're at work and they're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: why are you rubbing your hand?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, because the three
small fingers are numb and my thumb and my
[SPEAKER_07]: index finger feel like they're stuck in a
car door.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like that when I woke up and I
can't make it go away, but like,
[SPEAKER_07]: which jacket did you want to try on?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just one of those things that sucks
that you just have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until I found something that really helped
that inflammation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just taking random pills that the
doctor gave me and going to the
[SPEAKER_07]: chiropractor and the pills didn't do a
fucking thing other than mess with my
[SPEAKER_07]: stomach and my liver.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the chiropractor was helping some.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I found something that's half
THC, half CBD, that inflammation really
[SPEAKER_07]: started to come down and I started having
lower pain days, lower crazy sensation
[SPEAKER_07]: days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then slowly but surely I started
getting pain free days and do those first
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of pain free days where I was like
it was a teenager again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it never happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your endocannabinoid system back
in line.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that the rec industry has
progressed to where it is, there are
[SPEAKER_07]: several places in town where I can go in
and pick up half THC, half CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like when I get home from the end of a
long day and my knees are swollen a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit, my feet hurt and my back hurts and
I've eaten enough bowls of shit for the
[SPEAKER_07]: day and I'm in kind of a foul mood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two or three dabs of that will have me
feeling like none of that happened
[SPEAKER_07]: physically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a wonder against for the day
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD for the win.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, CBD ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I brought you along for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go through a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug, who's been on the episode before
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Doug today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Doug.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug, you looked great today.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to see you doing well.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD has changed his life a hundred
percent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana has saved Doug's life.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I honestly, it's hard to
think stuff like this right now because
[SPEAKER_07]: we've lost a lot of people this year,
but I don't know if Doug could still be
[SPEAKER_01]: here without medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, mentally, spiritually,
and physically, Doug would not be the same
[SPEAKER_01]: person without medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I saw some of the same stuff I was
going through in his world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, listeners, if you don't have
physical pain in your life or if you've
[SPEAKER_07]: never really been injured for a while,
it's kind of hard to understand what
[SPEAKER_07]: people who do have nerve damage and pain
like that go through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best way I can describe it is it's
like a sound and it gets louder and louder
[SPEAKER_07]: and louder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as it gets louder, the world around
you gets smaller.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that sound presses in on the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are some days where there's
nothing but that sound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter that if you don't pick
up the phone, you're not going to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: job later.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter that you've got to go to
the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter that you had something
really important to do that day that you
[SPEAKER_07]: have to get up and go do now for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you're going to lose it forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: All there is is the pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll do anything to get away from it
or make it stop for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll give people ridiculous sums of
money because they claim to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: treatment that works.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the most part, nothing helps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was wearing a thing that
electrocuted me slowly, like a TENS unit,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it works okay for some issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for mine, it was literally just an
electrical shock that scrambled the pain
[SPEAKER_07]: impulse on the way to my brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that was the best that Western
science had for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one day I hit some high CBD hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And about half an hour later, I was like,
wait a second, nothing hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of drummed both my hands on the
table and I was like, and I can feel on my
[SPEAKER_07]: fingers and none of them hurt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd that guy with that vial of sticky
shit go?
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, CBD is absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people are starting to figure
it out so much so that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: scam and fake shit out in the world now.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not buying stuff with a lab test
on it from a very accredited retailer,
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to inform you.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of research going on into
CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully in the next 10 years,
we know a lot more about its medical
[SPEAKER_07]: applications, but I can vouch for its
ability to calm a headache and lower
[SPEAKER_07]: inflammation and swelling in your nerves
or around your nerves and your joints so
[SPEAKER_07]: that those pain signals aren't just
abilitating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces vomiting and nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke some CBD, it'll take that
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It suppresses seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we've talked about on the
podcast before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make you not have convulsions and
seizures, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most popular reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not for everyone, but there's several
different forms of epilepsy that THC work
[SPEAKER_07]: on and that CBD work on and then that the
two together work on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good anti-psychotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will slow down your PTSD and your
nightmares and your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have PTSD, I'll help you with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always sleep amazingly well when I've
been consuming CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an anti-oxidant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with degenerative disorders,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts as a protective anti-tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not destroy your tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you need THC to destroy a tumor,
but it will slow a tumor for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of very, very, very recent
cancer research on THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD slows tumor growth majorly,
is what they're seeing in mice trials,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can slow tumor growth, that gives us
a better chance to fight it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The good news to that equation is that THC
has been shown to kill it, which is where
[SPEAKER_07]: the first real medical research into Rick
Simpson oil-style products that would be
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrates of both.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why those are so effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little bit baked from that last tiny
dab, but as the medical research that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're starting to get, it really is in its
infancy, folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that if you have cancer and
you find some of this, you can cure
[SPEAKER_07]: yourself real easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what I'm saying here,
but the research is promising.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, in our lifetimes, we might see
legitimate package, perfectly dosed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got this kind of cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start you on this much THC,
this much CBD-style treatments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our lifetime, which would be,
oh, that would make me so happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you smell that dab that I just took?
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that smells, it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tasted it a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Turbex Pineapple Jack,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Nug Run Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I wanted to mention that CBD
does, it's an antidepressant, which I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's got its own antidepressant
properties, but also if a dude's not
[SPEAKER_01]: hurting every day, that's going to work as
an antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not having PTSD symptoms and
panic attacks, you're going to be less
[SPEAKER_01]: depressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, most days when I wake up
and I'm not hurting, it feels like my
[SPEAKER_07]: birthday still, because they're pretty
rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most days I wake up at least a little
stiff, a little sore, something,
[SPEAKER_07]: somewhere screaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only getting older, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when I was a teenager, I had more
than one doctor go, if you don't knock
[SPEAKER_07]: this shit off, it's going to hurt when
you're 30.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, shut up, put a cast on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, put a cast on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to go, where'd my roller blades go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cast off early, because I got other shit
to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a teenager in Colorado in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were still free to ride our bikes off
roofs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, before everything was
nerfed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we nerfed the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now little kids are fucking padded,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't get trophies when our team
didn't win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids are going to be a bunch of pussies in
the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the last generation that really got
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're the same age.
[SPEAKER_07]: We took full advantage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the same age.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was right there with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I remember more than one doctor going,
it's going to hurt when you're 30.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, they were all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the days that are pain free,
most of those I can accredit to last
[SPEAKER_07]: night, I knew I was hurting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I consumed a whole lot of THC CBD
concentrate instead of my normal mix of
[SPEAKER_07]: predominantly THC, flour, and shatter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wake up feeling a lot better,
really restful sleep, and really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really nice work on the inflammation while
I sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we should totally mention is CBD
by itself will not get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can consume a lot of CBD and you may
get a little grin, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get any psychedelic,
psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a high.
[SPEAKER_07]: The mood improvement is like you were
saying, when the pain goes away,
[SPEAKER_07]: your mood goes up a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you don't know what I'm talking
about, think about getting a bee sting
[SPEAKER_07]: when you get that stinger pulled out or a
splinter pulled out, or you've got a big
[SPEAKER_07]: painful exit that finally pops in that
relief of pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine that through your whole arm.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your whole arm felt like it was on fire
and then one moment it stopped feeling
[SPEAKER_07]: like that and just felt like your arm
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sensation's incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we finally get there, you know how
well it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that we can talk about is
CBD will reduce the effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a little too high,
if you've had too many dabs, if you're new
[SPEAKER_01]: and you take a big giant dab of THC and
you're just spinning, you're fucked up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take a little dab of CBD and it will
calm you down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll balance out your high.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some company that made a product
they were calling it rescue pills and it
[SPEAKER_07]: was just the CBD caps.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like CBD filled gel cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your buddy took too many dabs and
they're freaking out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_07]: just hand them this and give them a hug
for half an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for this to kick in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This and some Doritos and you'd be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine makes, for a relative of
his that he's a caregiver for,
[SPEAKER_07]: he makes CBD capsules and he does
something to the oil to make it a little
[SPEAKER_07]: more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was taking those at night for a while
while I had a few and oh good Lord did I
[SPEAKER_07]: feel wonderful the next day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just pain free and just in a really,
really nice mood.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of companies that are
making CBD dog treats, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool because a lot of the shepherd
breeds are known for their dysplasia and
[SPEAKER_01]: hip problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shepherd dog that stayed at my
house for a little while now and he gets
[SPEAKER_01]: some CBD treats occasionally and he seems
to be a happy little dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't seem to cause him any problems and
it's going to keep him pain free,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep his little hips happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a Malamute that's pushing 13 and
a half now.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's almost 14.
[SPEAKER_07]: Breed life expectancy is eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her knees, her ankles, basically every
joint is shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: When she doesn't want to go up and down
the stairs, I've been adding a little THC
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD tincture to her food.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the days that I added, she's five years
younger.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see it helping with the pain and
the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes about 20 minutes, half an hour to
kick in for her and you can see the change
[SPEAKER_07]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had five or six customers come in
looking for something for their dogs
[SPEAKER_07]: before I thought to try it and yeah,
I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are companies that are making
specific edibles for dogs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things available at hemp stores
that have CBD for your dog that are made
[SPEAKER_01]: in America with actual hemp products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say there's anything wrong with
that as long as it's made with real hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: or real cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, if it's sold in a brick and
mortar retailer in the United States,
[SPEAKER_07]: it has to at least contain what the label
says.
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently, the DEA just sent out a thing to
a bunch of CBD only companies and the
[SPEAKER_07]: internet freaked out and was like,
oh, they're just attacking weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They always do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were targeting the people that are
selling like codfish oil and calling it
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD oil because people don't know any
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't take this stuff to a lab and get
it tested as a civilian.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just getting scammed out of money
on the internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful if you're ordering online
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got a number of different
ailments, you should get online and check
[SPEAKER_07]: out and see if there's any research on
what THC and CBD is.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD can do for those, for your specific
ailment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then check out the laws in your state and
see if and where you can get this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to come take a vacation in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of the people doing exactly
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They come, they visit one of our rec
stores and a good rec store will have a
[SPEAKER_07]: decent selection of CBD products at this
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might not have a huge selection or a
wide selection, but they should have some.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to more than one store while
you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out weed maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out Leafly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are menus available to see what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately on the mobile apps,
they cannot show you pricing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they take that off the mobile app?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all the pricing has gone on all the
mobile apps, but you can still find them
[SPEAKER_01]: on the web if you use your computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weedmaps.com and Leafly, L-E-A-F-L-Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming to Colorado, I think
those are effective in all the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's pretty much nationwide now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to search for locations of
your favorite strains or products or
[SPEAKER_01]: topicals or whatever you're looking for,
go to those websites and you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: information on the products you're looking
for and you can find specific locations
[SPEAKER_01]: that have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get mad at me if a dispensary does
not update their weed maps menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was about to say is weed maps and
Leafly are great places to start your
[SPEAKER_07]: search, but if you're looking for a very
specific product or even kind of a general
[SPEAKER_07]: product, you're looking for something with
a certain ratio of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_07]: some THC, some CBD, something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out weed maps or Leafly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make a list of possible shops and then go
ahead and give them a call and just real
[SPEAKER_07]: quick ask them, hey, what's your selection
of blah?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you have in for CBD options right
now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have black pickpens?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but like be specific in what you're
looking for as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then narrow your list that way because
I mean, the industry is weird right now
[SPEAKER_07]: and you never know when somebody is going
to walk in and say, give me all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's on their menu might not have
anything to do with what's on their store
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf at this moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might just be stuff that's been on the
store shelf in the last 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shopping at Green and Healthy the
other day and I was frustrated because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to, I bought something and the guy
behind me was frustrated because I had
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had to say, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, why is it on the list?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, he just bought all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how quickly she could sell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it out and I cleaned them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the bottom of that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched a dude buy 160 things of hard
candies one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just like, okay, let me get you
a box and sweep all of these into the box.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like for the rest of the week,
we had to tell people, sorry, we're out of
[SPEAKER_07]: that particular product line.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were like, is there something
wrong with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something amazing with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently honestly, every, every month
I've worked in a dispensary that's
[SPEAKER_07]: happened with at least one product line
once.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sometimes it's only the last eight
or 10 or 20 units or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go to, you went with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the clinic in Denver and they
had Durbin poison wax and they had Vortex
[SPEAKER_01]: wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved from the clinic on Mexico in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have these products anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've changed their game, but they used
to have- This was like three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vortex tasted like cranberries and
dirty feet and rotten fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you like that feet smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love that in my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the high that they gave me,
I couldn't focus on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made my eyes jump around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was on a bumpy road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Durbin poison just, I love the
flavor of good Durbin poison wax and that
[SPEAKER_01]: head high is just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day we'd go to the clinic
and I would save up as much money as I can
[SPEAKER_01]: afford to save up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd walk in there and I'd say,
how much of that Durbin poison do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd say, there's about 14 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd say, how much of that Vortex
do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd usually have somewhere between
14 and 28 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would buy it and I would clean it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy behind me would be like,
oh yeah, he bought a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be like, sorry, he bought all
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it the other day with those
delicious truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut me off eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought I was flipping it,
but I was really, I was smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I love it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The place was two and a half hours away
from my house at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go stock up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the last four boxes of coda and I
watched the lady behind me come in and go,
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, do you guys smell those truffles?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So forgive a shop if they don't have
something that they did have advertised on
[SPEAKER_07]: their weed maps menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, a good shop is going to keep
that mostly updated, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: want to call and double check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro tip, I don't say pro tip ever,
but if you want to sound like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're talking about, don't say CBDs,
say CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's cat, boy, dog are the initials.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not an apostrophe S or an S.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I look at it, you don't say THCs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This strain has a lot of THCs in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say this strain has a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you say this strain has a lot of
CBDs?
[SPEAKER_07]: In all fairness to the American public,
like Sanjay Gupta fucked that up on his
[SPEAKER_07]: weed special.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I didn't catch that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize it was Sanjay that did
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't him that started it,
but like it's a common mispronunciation or
[SPEAKER_07]: mispronunciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just CBD, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't say, I want a glass of
waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just say, I want a glass of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that there's a lot of water
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a measurement that contains a
specific amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're looking for CBD, not CBDs
because it's not a group of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't say CHCs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't say corns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some corns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, I want some corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't eat cereals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You eat cereal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's one of those things we hear that
like Sadova and Indigo that when you hear
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDs, you just cringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do an episode in the future
about Sativa and Indica and the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences and the benefits and balances
and the growing styles and everything of
[SPEAKER_01]: each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about Sadova and Indigo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa and Indica, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And phenotype,
P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E-Phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on it, strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to do that one?
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a hilarious post the other day on
social media that was like, I love all
[SPEAKER_07]: those 90% THC strands out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just about died laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my boy, Cooper Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made a short educational video on the
difference between strain and strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strands are ropes or fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains are different varieties of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be technical, you can call
it a varietal or a cultivar, but let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: with strain instead of strand as a start,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's trichome and not trichrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've gone on long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because knowing is half the battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of battle, that was a good segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of battle, I wanted to talk about
Nate Diaz from the UFC and UFC 202.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real American hero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about my opinion of
the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't matter, but those dudes threw
the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ended with them both standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they beat the shit out of each other
for 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see the fight, but I did see the
press conference we're about to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And holy shit, he looked like a side of
beef getting ready to hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got punched in the face a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conor McGregor has got some punches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I want to talk about when
they're interviewing him, dude just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight pulls out a vape pen and starts
taking vape pen rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the rep... I've got the video
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just play this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a couple of seconds long here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to play this video and then
we'll talk for a couple of seconds and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the pen he pulls out, just so you guys
know, if you haven't seen the video,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's your standard concentrate vape pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a million different versions of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bring the volume up slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All top 10 people to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes the part we want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly are you just for the record
smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is True.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the True Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with a healing process and
inflammation and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get these for before,
after the fight, it's training and make
[SPEAKER_00]: your life a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD oil, if you don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big part of this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The key right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your life a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD, make your life a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't have said it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched this video several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He fucked up where he said, it's good to
use before and after the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He shouldn't have said before the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucked up right there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he might be in a ton of trouble for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The specific rules bar cannabis
consumption period until six hours after
[SPEAKER_07]: the fight is what I was reading in random
press coverage of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't follow the sports.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense in all of the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't catch that from my intro to
this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that USATO rules or is that rules from
the local governing sporting agency?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was rules with an S in the news
article.
[SPEAKER_07]: I read it as all I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost said rules with a Z, but I
honestly don't know whose rules they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: MMA fighters can't use any sort of
cannabis product or any sort of banned
[SPEAKER_07]: substance, which marijuana or cannabis
products would be on the list until six
[SPEAKER_07]: hours after the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I already know your answer
here, but do you think a dude that just
[SPEAKER_01]: spent 25 minutes of his night getting
kicked in the dick and punched in the face
[SPEAKER_01]: should be allowed to take a couple of rips
off a CBD vape pen at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most assuredly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd offer him a dab of this wonderful half
and half.
[SPEAKER_07]: After a beating like that, anything that's
going to help you recover faster and deal
[SPEAKER_07]: with that level of trauma is encouraged by
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says it reduces inflammation and
swelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude, did his face look like a
jack-o-lantern?
[SPEAKER_07]: It did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I applaud his use of anything
other than heavy narcotics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that what they usually throw at him?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they do to deal with the
pain at the end of that, but Nate Diaz did
[SPEAKER_01]: make a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I'm going to a party and Conor
McGregor is going to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how accurate that was because
Nate Diaz looked like he had his face
[SPEAKER_01]: punched in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even talk about who I feel like
won that fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't matter at all on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is that Nate Diaz took a hell
of a beating and that during the press
[SPEAKER_07]: conference, he was ripping a CBD pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, blatantly ripping it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took two or three big fat rips off of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't cough like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he took it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't smoke cigarettes all day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was the key to his success
was tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes him the MMA fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes him tough as nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the nickname Wheezy comes
from, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they call him Young Wheezy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this dude should, I feel like
almost everybody should be allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should be allowed to consume
CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a victim of a head injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that 42 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely, that CBD changed my life
and it helped me get out of my funk that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the episode wasn't focused on CBD,
but that's sort of what they were inching
at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the story they were telling was
THC and CBD are both neuroprotectants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next question was going to be,
do you think that cannabis use is a
[SPEAKER_01]: performance enhancing drug?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the performance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fighting, kicking people, fighting,
UFC fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about football?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not performance enhancing at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about basketball?
[SPEAKER_01]: Injury and recovery enhancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about basketball?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm trying to play devil's advocate
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about video games?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like when I smoke, I haven't played
video games in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things where I would put
it on the yes list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But see, then in my mind, since I am so
comfortable, I've got ADD, my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: wanders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell by listening to the podcast,
my mind just fucking darts around all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the damn place.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke some hash, it does help me
focus a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a moment there for the first
fucking 10 minutes where my brain just
[SPEAKER_01]: spins, but once it lands back in its
place, I'm pretty well focused.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got mild ADD as well, and that's one
of the things I've always enjoyed about
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is it helps slow down the
sporadicness of the thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I can shoot pool better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can shoot basketball better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play football.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably throw my football with
more accuracy after I took a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played drums for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had drum lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played in big bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I played in small bands, sometimes smoking
a little weed makes me play a little
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes smoking a little weed fucks me
up, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely alters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're talking about just helping
the athlete or the performer tune out
[SPEAKER_07]: other distractions and focus on the
competition in the moment, I don't see it
[SPEAKER_07]: making you run faster and jump higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I think of when I think of
performance enhancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're packing yourself full of blood so
that your heart can move more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking more testosterone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm faster, meaner, leaner,
quicker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: A steroid so that you have more physical
muscle mass.
[SPEAKER_07]: But THC doesn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis doesn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make me able to kick you in the
face any harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make me give you more damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It helps me recover from that face kick
faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not a performance enhancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a recovery enhancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if I was the UFC fighter and we're
gearing up for the fight and the music's
[SPEAKER_01]: going and Rogan's all out there,
oh my God, this is the fight of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking night, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rogan's just going nuts with his bald
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking too much alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your mouthpiece have a little dab,
a dab mouthpiece attachment to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fighter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a UFC fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my fucking hand wraps on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my tape coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my gloves on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my ankle wraps on because I got
these long chicken legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come out and they're like,
Ross and Jeff, you got to fight in 30
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready for your pre-show dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, let's get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they drop me like a half a gram of
some pineapple jack nug run shatter on
[SPEAKER_01]: there and I blow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I want to do after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how these, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you smoke, how do you medicate and
want to fight at all?
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is how little MMA I watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't manipulate, no, you can
manipulate the rig, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they need their fingers to grapple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking boxing style where you
can't hold the rig.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got one manager holding up the
smoke buddy, one manager holding up the
[SPEAKER_07]: rig, another manager working the nail in
the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems complicated for a pre-fight
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use one of those, uh, the hit man
hinge nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do it with one hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it with my glove on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The announcer's microphone comes down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff's rig comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am one of those guys that if there's a
dab to be taken, I will make sure it
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the dab giver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we got to work the Nate Diaz clip
into this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that and I was so blown away.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's gotta be Photoshopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I clicked the volume on it and they
start talking about it and I was blown
[SPEAKER_07]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Nate Diaz for representing
cannabis in a tough decision loss too.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes up all chest out proud to lead the
way about medical cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial he's in no way like politically
correct or gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's just balls to the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got kicked in the fucking head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smoke some CBD to help it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be mad at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of those brothers are going to
end up banned from the UFC and banned from
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they keep playing the way that they do,
and that's going to be terrible because I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to see their performances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you guys, it is random.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dreadlocked hippie Rastafarian dude,
but I love to watch some UFC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dudes weigh 200 pounds and they're
fucking jacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got more testosterone in their
body than most people should have and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to break shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that they're in that cage
breaking each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then out at the bar or at the dab lounge
trying to break me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I condone that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to battle in that cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jiu Jitsu.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've both known people who were just
built to brawl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are here to drum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are here to high five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are here to brawl.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all got our skill.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good that they have an outlet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fan of MMA.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't care enough to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I am accidentally an MMA fan
because of Joe Rogan and because of Joey
[SPEAKER_01]: Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It rubbed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just rubs off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many Joe Rogan experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogan puts out the fight companion tour
him and a bunch of his friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also listened to Fighter and the Kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more MMA that gets pumped into my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put out a fight companion where two
guys from Fighter and the Kid and Eddie
[SPEAKER_01]: Bravo and Joe Rogan sit around and they
watch the UFC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about what's going on and they
drink beer and smoke weed and get fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: up and talk shit to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're watching the UFC and they tell you
in the match, they're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: round three of this match, we're at 29,
28, 27 seconds and you can sync up your
[SPEAKER_01]: computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost weirdly like you're hanging
out with Rogan and the crew watching the
[SPEAKER_07]: fight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watch it if it's on somewhere I'm at,
but I don't actively pay attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm over at your house and it's on,
it'll get more attention out of me than
[SPEAKER_07]: football or basketball would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a little karate when I was a
youngster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been fascinated with that type
of skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took Kung Fu San Su for several years
and then Pung Su Do karate for even
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just impressed to do his rep in CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked that he had a little CBD vape pen
that was set up like an O-pen or any of
[SPEAKER_07]: the other major vape companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just rip it on some CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took like two or three good, maybe three
or four good rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we've been rambling for
almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we miss any other points on CBD?
[SPEAKER_07]: We covered this basic medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crossed out all the stuff on my list
except popular CBD strains so that if
[SPEAKER_01]: people wanted to grow cannabis that was
high in CBD, just a few strains I would
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything Harlequin, Kanatonic,
Harle-Su, Tora-Su, Tora-Bora, ACDC.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Tora-Bora is really wonderful folks
that I've had a lot of personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I went over that list really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were just off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I'd like to touch on I
think before we wrap this one up is for at
[SPEAKER_07]: least for the pain and inflammation that
I'm dealing with THC and CBD together in
[SPEAKER_07]: roughly 50-50 mix work two or 300 times
better than CBD alone or THC alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: The two of them together works.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not one plus one equals two.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one plus one equals seven as far as
I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_07]: The effect is amplified greatly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool ass math.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's wonderful when you mix THC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: The medical applications are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if I sound a little stoned and I
am pretty tired.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel clear headed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like alert and present.
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't true when I got here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hurting so bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I seriously almost didn't come folks and I
really like it and I didn't almost didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: come because my head was pounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you made it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you pulled through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad those CBD dabs fixed you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I should have just started dabbing
CBD earlier in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was out and about and didn't get a
chance all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how life goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get home and get the dab rig
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, remind everybody how they can follow
you on social media and absolutely remind
[SPEAKER_01]: us about your Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can catch me on Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws on Facebook.

[SPEAKER_07]: We're reaching more and more people every
week on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the viewers that I get per week
spike and change topic to topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as we've been getting close to the
election, the view counts been going up
[SPEAKER_07]: steady and it's been nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like to think this show has
something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're checking us out from the

[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you liked the last episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast Barry, what's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to the podcast since
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we see those messages, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see all of those messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you send me a message and I
have not responded to your message yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do one episode a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get 20 messages a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to filter out my favorite or the
most relevant from what's going on in our
[SPEAKER_01]: lives right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I handle the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be back with more episodes with
more email content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the listener generated content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lets me know that I'm getting the
information to the people that need the
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving them exactly what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know way too much about cannabis,
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We spend hours debating which little
nugget of our vast cannabis intellect to
[SPEAKER_07]: show.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we have an email that's like,
hey, I was wondering how to blah,
[SPEAKER_07]: it sparks some awesome conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of my favorite episodes, man,
are listeners with specific grow
[SPEAKER_07]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be going through the phone and I'll
get an email and it'll say a show question
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see me light up like,
oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now I get to ramble for 45 minutes
about one of my favorite things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know a whole bunch about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it always makes me good to get those
messages.
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, from where we are in
Colorado, especially here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's hard to understand what you need to
know now in Florida or Georgia or wherever
[SPEAKER_07]: you have in Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have listeners all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you send it in a question that lets
us know where you're at and how we can
[SPEAKER_07]: help you, helps us clue in on the
information to give you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I absolutely love those episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so much fun to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two email episodes were
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plenty more coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, don't be afraid to send me some
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be discouraged if I haven't replied
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get so many messages that it's honestly
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me to hire an intern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that that would be bullshit because
it's all about talking to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to talk to my intern.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want a pre-typed answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to actually communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my best to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you don't know how to get in
touch with me, this is how you do it.

[SPEAKER_01]: That picture I posted with the female
grateful dog plant with the male arise
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers and pollen on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dropped little flowers and the pollen
dumped on there and it's already showing
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.

50 something likes at the last time I
[SPEAKER_01]: looked.

[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thank you for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to for the CBD episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's honestly what the final decision
maker for leaving the house and coming
[SPEAKER_07]: over and doing the show was, I wanted to
do another good episode about CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Myself and Doug did one a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and I've had Fox on a couple of times
also.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you've done two with Fox.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was who I was hinting at when
he said, let's do a CBD episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, do we want a third?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you were like, no, let's just do a you
and me show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he lives in Denver now, so it's
harder to get with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but he's sort of the CBD go-to that
I know of down here.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I have a CBD question, that's who I
send a message to.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if you guys have CBD questions or
any other questions, please hit us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions at all, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for us to take some fat dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dad and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Blow out my whole brain like Cobain.
[SPEAKER_12]: The moment that he realized he sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: But fuck depression, I ain't fixing to
fall.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'ma come with progression and I'll give
it my all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the moment that you stop is when
the movement will end.
[SPEAKER_12]: So do it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: I give a fuck who the truth will offend.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go do it then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Loyal to music, no wonder you move with
the trend.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can pretend you do it while I do it
again.
Do it then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it then.
Do it then.
