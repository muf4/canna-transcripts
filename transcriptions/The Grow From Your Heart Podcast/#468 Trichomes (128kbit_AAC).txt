[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome to episode 468 of
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of India Pale
Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Ruby Red and Peel Your
Face.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, the flavor is described as
hops, fuel and grapefruit rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I get the hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is certainly a fuely after flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grapefruit rind is absolutely there,
but I get more of a strawberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon sort of a flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it a fresh smell right
now just so I can give you an accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: updated description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has definitely got the
watermelon, strawberry notes to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends with the hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that grapefruit rind kind of takes
over at the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a lingering hint of fuel
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I would have put watermelon
and strawberry in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does pack a nice punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 68.09% THC, non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does pack a nice punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part that really stands out is
that delicious, sweet, strawberry candy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious, India Pale
[SPEAKER_00]: Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to do a
couple of shout outs to our friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: to our friend Gabriel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast fist bump and a thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: our new friend J.M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
thank you to Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big thank you to Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send a big thank you to
Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I always want to send a big
giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I owe a big high five, a fist bump,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out,
a hug, and a thank you to our buddy Stabby
[SPEAKER_00]: McStabwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, big thank you to everybody
who supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like to learn how to

[SPEAKER_00]: visiting www.patreon.com slash Grow From
Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am going to read a couple of
listener emails in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do need to apologize because I'm
realizing as I record that I sound like I
[SPEAKER_00]: am getting a head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know it was happening until I
put these headphones on and started
[SPEAKER_00]: recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound like shit and I apologize for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have noticed that my voice
sounds fucking terrible, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't noticed, don't notice,
don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get to the first email in
this episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from a friend who calls
themselves the King of Prussia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to the podcast for the
last few months and learning an insane
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of info, I figured it was time to
join Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for joining Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you were able to learn a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you can use King of Prussia for
this shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Wilson?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, been listening to your
podcast a whole lot lately and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: loving the show and all of the info.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is truly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening and thanks for the
words of encouragement and for noticing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm trying hard and for appreciating
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm listening to the episode from
Friday and the vape pen through security
[SPEAKER_00]: topic gave me a good laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been listening to the
podcast, you heard me talk about taking my
[SPEAKER_00]: vape pens through security, getting them
into some concerts, having a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: with my Green Dot Labs full spectrum
extract vape pens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to heavily medicate at some
fish concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to well medicate at a Tom
Segura comedy show recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without those vape pens, I would have
been not very well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue with this message
because it says, I am in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to my local courthouse to pick up
my pistol permit and had to go through a
[SPEAKER_00]: metal detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, when you go into most courthouses,
you are forced to walk through the metal
[SPEAKER_00]: detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person says I emptied my pockets and
completely forgot I had my cartridge pen
[SPEAKER_00]: in my pocket that I got while on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person walked into the court.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought, sure, I'll throw my car keys
and my cell phone and whatever else in the
[SPEAKER_00]: little basket here and I'll walk right
through the metal detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude realizes I have got my
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked up a cart when he was in
Portland, probably came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the travel woes took over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely forgot that cartridge was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude pulls it out in the courthouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, nearly shit myself as the cop
took the bin and I walked through the
[SPEAKER_00]: metal detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could imagine that feeling being
in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much more secure than a lot of other
places I am certain of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Colorado, if they catch you
with your pen, they go, fuck and take that
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't bring that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if they catch you with that in
New York, they go, oh, you're already in
[SPEAKER_00]: the court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put you in a cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just skip a bunch of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this person says not a word was
said and I was on my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, that law enforcement officer that
had to inspect the handful of crap that
[SPEAKER_00]: they passed through, they just thought,
oh, that's probably just a nicotine pen
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the thing was that you just slid
it right through and didn't act like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't think it was anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't hand them drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't be like, here's my drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they thought these aren't drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, yeah, that's probably your
nicotine pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just let it slide right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really happy that you did not get
yourself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more careful, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there, if you are going to any
sort of environment where you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you may need to empty your pockets,
do a double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't have anything illegal
in your pocket so you don't get yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really funny meme that goes
around on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows that a waitress in Colorado went
to leave her pen along with the check at
[SPEAKER_00]: the restaurant so the diner could sign
their check, but they accidentally left
[SPEAKER_00]: their dab pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that were the wrong environment,
that person could have gotten in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, it is a Colorado restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody probably laughed pretty hard at
that, but we've got to be more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do catch myself getting too relaxed,
too comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to other places, I do travel out
of state a little bit, and I catch myself
[SPEAKER_00]: just smoking places that I shouldn't be
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, oh yeah, you're not in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I was talking about hitting my vape
pen at a Tom Segura comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never smoke in ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was at a different venue,
a much larger venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I caught myself, I had my pen in my
hand just because I have it, and I clicked
[SPEAKER_00]: the button a couple of times and I put it
in my mouth and I just ripped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I had a lung full of dab smoke,
I realized, you've got a lung full of dab
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke in a comedy club and you should not
be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, now what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of smoke in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to hold that shit in until I almost
died, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did catch myself getting a little too
comfortable, a little too at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pulled out my pen and ripped it right
there in the Belko Theater like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be smoking it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to be smoking it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have kicked me out if somebody
had spotted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to learn to be a little more
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a legal state, still be a
little bit paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in an illegal state,
please be extra careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're paranoid, let's not get
ourselves in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, our friend walked through and not
a word was said because he acted like
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there is one more sentence left in
this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, thanks for spreading the
knowledge and keep up the amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, our friend, King of Prussia,
I want to call you Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get that joke, you're a lot cooler
than some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did not get in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there wants to send me
an email, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just keep the show moving right into
the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hefe Jeff, I've got four outdoor
container-grown sun-kissed plants where
[SPEAKER_00]: the top surface trichomes are about 20%
amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person has four sun-kissed plants
outdoors in containers and the top surface
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are 20% amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun-kiss is a cross that I bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, of course, the platinum tangy
from our friends at the Garden of Whedon,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful strain to work with,
a great outdoor strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have good success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, normally I would think these
plants would be ready for harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but looking at the undersides of the
leaves through a high quality botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope showing trichomes are still
clear and cloudy with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: amber coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person has acquired a scope that
probably magnifies somewhere to 60 to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: X and they're looking at the undersides of
the leaves through their microscope and
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes are still clear on the
undersides of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the message says, I am a beginner
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my third grow and I previously
would have cut these plants at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but given that they're at day 48 of flower
and the suggested harvest age from
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegeneticsColorado.com is 56 days,
I'm wondering if I should wait another
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have had a lot of TLC and
full sunlight all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're just ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ends it with, appreciate any
feedback you can provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to call him Caffeine is
what he signed it as here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a couple of things
that our buddy Caffeine had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to make you feel better,
I do intend on doing a full episode on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about four or five episodes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mostly written, so we will get a
full episode on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, let's focus on some of the
questions in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start off right on track with
trichomes or 20% amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally I would think these plants
are ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 20% amber trichomes,
you are absolutely ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost would have taken that plant down
sooner, but you're still going to be all
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice harvest window here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit about that in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying, but looking at the
underside of the leaves through a high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality microscope shows clear with little
amber coloration in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the undersides of the leaves don't
really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are going for is ripe trichomes on
the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those leaves are you going to
smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully not too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're going to turn that into
concentrates or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're not smoking the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to focus mostly on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look at a bud up at top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look at a bud halfway down the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would look at a lower bud and I
would do a few checks with my microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would see what percentage of the
trichomes are amber in each section of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would use my best judgment to
harvest based on the overall appearance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes you're finding on the
undersides of the leaves would have very
[SPEAKER_00]: little to do with my decision making when
thinking about harvest times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not matter to me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you've got 20% amber
trichomes on your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are probably ready for
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you did bring up a very good topic in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I previously would have cut
these, but they're at day 48 and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website from the breeder, which is myself,
we recommend 56 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're wondering if you should wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are showing you that they're
done, they are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about what the website says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about what I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about what I said in a live
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about what anybody on social
media tells you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the trichomes are amber, the plant is
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we use to gauge the ripeness
of a plant is amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our goal is a ripe trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that is ripe, the plant is ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody on Facebook knows if that trichome
is ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody on any social media knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it's ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are variations in plants that come
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, most phenotypes of that plant
overall will end around the 56 day mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have gotten a little extra
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have gotten a little less sunshine
than some grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you fed it something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you fed it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you fed it less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is just a phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got one that finishes around,
what day are you at?
[SPEAKER_00]: 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got one that finished a week
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good thing and it is very
possible because the sun kiss strain does
[SPEAKER_00]: have phenotypes that end a little bit
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I would have written on that
package or on my website that those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: end at 48 days, if those plants took 52
days, the world would have been pissed off
[SPEAKER_00]: at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So saying that they end at 56 days and
you've got one that went a week early,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is kind of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still sucks because I gave you poor
timing, but that is an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a phenotypical variance,
something that is kind of expected when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I listed 56 days because
that is my experience indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've grown this outdoors, so you're
finding different results because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were talking about the time that
it should take to flower on a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, that is a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the breeder of those plants,
that estimate is based on different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we can type whatever we
want on our websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can type whatever we want on our
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are very few people that will
hold us accountable to that until growers
[SPEAKER_00]: start buying the seeds and discovering
that we told a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only thing holding us
accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by then you've bought the seeds and
you've grown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got your money and they're on
vacation already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper way to do it is to create the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow them and take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how I determine how long I
suggest those seeds are grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: is by growing out large populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow at least 100 seeds before
anybody else gets to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow 100, it is really easy to
create percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one does it, it's 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If 50 plants do it, that is 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to identify traits and
keep statistics with populations of 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew out 100 of those and the average
of those plants were done at day 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have had outliers go a week each
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have had outliers go two weeks
either direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I determined overall was that 56
days would be the average completion time
[SPEAKER_00]: for that strained sun kiss, where most
people would have the best success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do have to keep in mind that these
are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be genetic variation in
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeds made from plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just taking pollen and putting it on
another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature is making these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to expect some variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun kiss is an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not been worked to create more
homogenous phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the variation that come from F1
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the vigor that comes from an F1
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to learn to understand and
accept the variation that comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that growing from seed gives me
the option to find something that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: else will ever have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the entire neighborhood is sharing
clones, everybody is growing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a couple of weeks, everybody is
going to be tired of the same fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you buy a pack of seeds and you find
two or three different phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already got two or three different
things that set you apart from the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the other people that are growing
that same clone that everybody in the hood
[SPEAKER_00]: is spreading around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you are separating yourself from
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing for profitability,
that is a great way to set yourself apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you select that best phenotype that
works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the one that sells the best,
the one that works the best for your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style, the one that does what needs to be
done in your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find that by growing from
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy seeds and nobody else in the
hood bottom, you're the only one with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get to grow that pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find a keeper phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to dominate the market
because you've got something that sets you
[SPEAKER_00]: apart from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoy growing from seed and I
really enjoy the variation that I get when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like buying a pack of
baseball cards, or I guess today you would
[SPEAKER_00]: say Magic the Gathering or fucking Pokemon
cards or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this pack of cards, you get a pack
of seeds and you go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of just opening it up and
going through and seeing how many lands
[SPEAKER_00]: and how many rare cards you've got,
or how many fucking Mickey Mantle cards
[SPEAKER_00]: you got, you got to grow the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 10 seeds, you put them in some
water, you put them in some dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we nurture them for several
weeks, a couple of months probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of that, we get to
find out what cards came in that package
[SPEAKER_00]: of cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we just get a rare card that's going
to help us win the game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we just get Mickey Mantle or did we
just get a bunch of lands and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: short stops?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the fun of growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find out what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really find magic in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me excited to grow from a pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Ooh, I wonder what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I am blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to find many variations,
many anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see things from populations that
most people will never get to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing from seed really excites me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try to get myself back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would focus on the trichomes on the
buds, not as much as the trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't too worried about the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of bonus trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are secondary trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to cut those off and
throw them away if they are not used for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focus on those trichomes on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said they're 20% amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably time to harvest that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've been flushing because it is
time to cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I hope you took a clone because you've
got a phenotype that ends a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indoors, that plant would be a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very hard to find a plant that
finishes around the 48 day marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase productivity by one full
crop per year indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that phenotype and it is
reliable and it creates a potent product
[SPEAKER_00]: that people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we are running eight or
nine week plants, which will give us about
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.7 harvests per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep a perpetual cycle going in one
room, if you cut off those extra few days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you give us the potential for one extra
harvest in our room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now based on the amount of lights and
square footage in that room, that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as one pound per year extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in some facilities where I work,
that could be as much as 250 pounds extra
[SPEAKER_00]: product in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're really lucky,
really blessed to have found a phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: of Sunkist that ends at 48, possibly 50
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is highly potent for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of all, I really want to see some
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't cut it down by the time you
hear this, go outside, take a nice photo
[SPEAKER_00]: and send that shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send it to me at grow from your
heart at hotmail.com, or you can send it
[SPEAKER_00]: to my breeder email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I would love to see your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying,
appreciate any feedback you can provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to run that indoors
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it works very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up and he calls himself
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our buddy,
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
