[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 825 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds, hang out, we'll talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the free seeds later in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that the
Dude-Groves Cup is coming to Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado on June 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the Dude-Groves Cup is
coming back to Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team Irie Genetics will be there,
I will be there, White Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do invite you to join us at the
Dude-Groves Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tickets are on sale now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is all the business we
need to cover here at the top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into one of my new favorite
sections of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called my pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many things that will drive
people crazy in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps when you go to somebody else's
grow room or you see pictures of a girl
[SPEAKER_00]: online, there's something that just drives
you crazy, that makes you cringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been accepting pet peeves on the show
from listeners and we're reading those on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great pet peeve here on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who wants to
be called JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend JJ says, Pet peeve on the
forums, Cal Mag is the answer to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely correct, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got thrips, try Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got leaf curl, needs Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a light burn, Cal Mag for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are correct, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the forums, we do see that Cal Mag is
the absolute answer for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge pet peeve of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag is not always the answer for
everything and people often forget that
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and magnesium are two different
elements, two different nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sold in the same bottle,
but it is not always the absolute answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, Cal Mag always being the solution
on the internet is a huge pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sending in that pet peeve,
my dude, you do win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your email address here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you a gift card to your email
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your spam and I will
send you that coupon code, a gift card for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of iRegenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you want me to
read your peeve here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab that says grow questions or
grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, I will give you
the opportunity in there to ask us a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that grow help tab as your pet
peeve tab for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me those grow room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your peeve here on the show,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You win a free pack of iRegenetics Premium
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to add on to this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pet peeve is just terrible advice on
the internet anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will ask a question about why is
my plant dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody will complain about
their lights, their ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start telling them all kinds of
unnecessary shit about that grow and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: the person that's already having one
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll throw them way off course and give
them 10 or 20 other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet does drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's a big part of why I
started this podcast right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not excited with the nonsense I was
seeing on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to correct some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I would make my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to do a book, but then I read
and realized that books, they run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis cultivation world,
any book that was written 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: the basics apply, but the technology,
the equipment and a lot of the techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: have evolved so rapidly that I decided a
podcast would be the only way we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really keep up with the rapidly changing
industry, the techniques, the technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment that is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, to support your statement there,
terrible information on the internet is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my biggest pet peeves as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, my dude, thank you for the
great pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I do encourage you
to send your pet peeves to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that grow help tab or that questions
tab on the iReGenetics webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I read your peeve on the podcast,
you also will get a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into the question and
answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to take questions from that grow
help tab I told you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, go to my website, iregenetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab on the top that says grow
help or grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill out the questionnaire, send us your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the show,
you will win a free pack of iReGenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from our friend who
wants to be called Perry Robbins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perry, great to meet you, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, yo Rasta Jeff,
I love your products and I've had great
[SPEAKER_00]: success with all that I've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is a good way to start a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for trusting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for using my products and thanks
for sharing that you're having great
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I like to cure in jars and I
keep around 58 to 60 percent humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I found it weird tonight when
opening my lemon Jeffrey that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: visible oils on the lids and the sides of
the jar, yet it is still at 57 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great thing and I'll talk more
about this in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, is this common for this strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kept in a cool dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just never seen it in jars like this
and I wonder if I did something wrong in
[SPEAKER_00]: the curing process as in dumb luck or just
great products like I suspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've only been growing a few
years, but I fell in love with this great
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thought I would share thanks from
your friend Perry Robbins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perry, my dude, this is an amazing
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume I believe that those oils you
found around the rim and the lid of your
[SPEAKER_00]: jar, those are terpenes, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you if you rub your finger in there,
give it a smell, give it a little taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have a very strong lemon,
lime, aroma and flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you taste it, it's going to be pretty
sharp on the tongue, but if you roll
[SPEAKER_00]: around a nug around in that and then smoke
that nug, it's going to be super terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, I believe, I assume that
those are terpenes that have gathered in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some terpy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that you've done a
really good job with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has another idea
what that could be, I'm very open to
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions and recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please either leave them in the comments
on YouTube or send them to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what else this could be,
but it says oil on the lids and sides of
[SPEAKER_00]: the jars and we're still at 57% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really going to assume that those are
terpenes that have stayed there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the jar during the curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand the complete science,
but my assumption is that those are
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me pictures if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the consistency and the
color, and I definitely recommend that you
[SPEAKER_00]: stick your finger in it and give it a good
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're brave, give it just a little bit
of a taste and then give me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Report back and let me know what you
discover by smelling it and tasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, if those are terps, you have
done an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should enter that weed in some sort of
a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get me a nugget of it so that I
could try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, yeah, you grew some good
shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're doing a free pack of
iRegenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you choose to pick up off
the website, and I want to see how you do
[SPEAKER_00]: with that next batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some momentum going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Momentum, is that how you say that word?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some momentum going, so let's not
stop at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move right here into the next
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also did come from that Grow Help
tab on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my new friend who wants
to be called Selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the word selective on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general grow question,
and it says, hey, so I'm wondering if you
[SPEAKER_00]: will talk about the best and easiest way
to deal with helmet head when your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: first sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most delicate time in the plant's
life, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, did you run out of stickers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am out of stickers for now, but if you
send me an email with your shipping
[SPEAKER_00]: address when I do print some more
stickers, I will send those your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have some stickers for the Dude
Grove's Cup if you're coming out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I also want to give you a great
compliment on the figure and potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey, as I have been running the
exact same phenotype for almost four years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been running the same plant for
four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands, if not millions,
of seeds to choose from out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've chosen to run this one for four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've kept the same clone for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the second person shouting out
Lemon Jeffrey in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just happened the way that it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, if anyone is on the fence about
getting Lemon Jeffrey, do yourself a favor
[SPEAKER_00]: and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is good advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's answer the main part of this
question here for my buddy Selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, talk about the easiest way to
deal with helmet head because he believes
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is the most delicate and
sensitive part of the seedling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So helmet head, what is helmet head?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've grown from seed, if you've
planted any seeds, this doesn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: happen with cannabis, but most commonly
with cannabis, when you plant some
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seeds, those seeds will break
through the dirt and they'll grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: through the dirt, and most of the time
they've shed their seed, their whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: their shell, by the time they come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens as they come up through the
dirt, and then it splits and you get your
[SPEAKER_00]: two top little starter leaves come out and
that spreads out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does happen sometimes with the
cannabis plant is that the seed will get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck on top of that seedling as it pushes
through the dirt and it just won't pop off
[SPEAKER_00]: as the seedling opens or pushes through
the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seedling, he's calling it the helmet,
just does not come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very easy solution to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, do your best not to panic when
you're growing because panic mode is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see something that really freaks
you out, you want to fix it right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do three or four solutions
when really one or two solutions would
[SPEAKER_00]: have done it and the extra two steps
caused more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't panic when it comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see an issue, take a big breath,
maybe go smoke a joint, think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the forums, go to my website,
come talk to me on Discord, read more
[SPEAKER_00]: online, get your brain sorted out,
then take action in the grow room once
[SPEAKER_00]: you've kind of settled your brain down,
but don't go into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus on this helmet head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you see your seedling coming up
and that shell is just stuck to there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't come off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the easiest way to get it and get
that shell off of there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get a spray bottle with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a little bit, it could be tap
water, it could be Fiji water,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pH it if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not necessary for what we're
about to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get water and a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll get some tweezers at the
same time if necessary, sometimes not even
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary, but I get that spray bottle and
I get real close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be an inch, maybe two inches away
from that seedling and I'll spray the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that helmet head with the water
because that water is going to soften up
[SPEAKER_00]: the shell and it's also going to loosen up
that natural glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is that's holding
that shell on, but it is kind of a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some sticky holding that bad dog
on there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit it with the spray bottle,
hit it with water and loosen it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that water will lubricate it
enough to where it'll just slide right off
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to get close and hit it
with the spray bottle kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it like the good, I spit real bad
when I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even going to edit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra apologize to that microphone,
but give it the good sort of a noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you squeeze it, you get some
pressure behind it and you kind of blow
[SPEAKER_00]: some water pressure at that ceiling head
to knock that ceiling top off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that doesn't work with one or two
good blasts, it's nice and wet by now,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can get some tweezers and gently
pull it off of there and continue to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should get it off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you don't want to tug
that plant to where it's tugging at the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots because then you're going to cause
damage to the roots on that taproot that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already digging into the dirt there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to tug on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will kill your seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will kill that little sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray it and just real gently pull that
helmet head off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to do it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the first time you do it, if it's real
stubborn, spray it, soak the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that plant pushes out there and that
thing gets drier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dries out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may start to fall off on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, spray it again, wait a few hours,
let it dry, spray it again and get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there with your tweezers and just be real
gingerly about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be real gentle and just take it off real
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water and tweezers are your best bet
for getting that off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you said, keep in mind,
this is the most critical and delicate
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do see that ceiling tugging,
and you're pulling too hard, wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: just let it grow a little bit longer,
spray it again later, try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it will come off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time they do fall off on their
own if you give them time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand you do want to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand seeds are not free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even my seeds are fairly priced and I
still think that seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want every one of them to come to
fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water, tweezers, and patience are the
main ingredients to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I answered every part of
the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big compliments for Alem and Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I answered your question,
my dude Selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, make sure you check your email
because you've got a gift card for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not checked iredirect.com in
the new year, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some new stuff up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not up there for the holiday
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do some new drops and
restocks here and keep things fresh for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have listened this far,
use coupon code love, you'll save 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question also came from the Grow
Help tab on the iRE genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called Prince Charmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have some beans from a
feminized Bruce banner that were
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by a regular Sunkiss male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a banner female that was femme
and a Sunkiss male that was obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, will a feminized seed
pollinated by a regular male be regular?
[SPEAKER_00]: And will there possibly be issues with
intersex plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the word Hermes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am anti the word Hermi, Hermes,
maybe hermaphrodite, but not Hermi or
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm skipping that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say intersex because that
is the true word of what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're asking about is her intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says these beans will be F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is, can a person,
can a grower, can a breeder take a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from a feminized seed and
pollinate that with a regular plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will the outcome be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will those be regs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be fems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be intersex?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: If all of the due diligence has been done,
if all the testing has been done properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: these will make regular F1 seeds that will
be 50% male and 50% female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there was no intersex traits within
the breeding, none of them should be
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this person is asking is,
can they pollinate a feminized plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: a regular plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several lines that are made by
pollinating a feminized line with a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done a feminized plant
pollinated it with a different feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those make great outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That female plant, that feminized plant is
no different in any way than a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: male female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the pollen has hit the seed or once
the pollen has hit the ovule and become a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed inside that brach, there is
absolutely no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have a lot of misunderstandings and
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference in a plant that came
from a feminized seed and a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do all kinds of DNA testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not find a difference on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is where the female feminized
action happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to see any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would take a regular female plant
that came from a regular seed or a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that came from a feminized seed and
you pollinated both of them with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: male, you're going to get positive
outcomes from both of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see any problems, any downsides,
any detrimental effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If both of those female plants are truly
female and have not been bred from other
[SPEAKER_00]: previous intersex generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have actually bred a few things where
the female plant, the mother side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant came from an originally feminized
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed was feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been pollinated with a regular male
and those plants make great outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew is grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is a feminized seed,
a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pollinated by the arise that makes
morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew makes amazing freaking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about also the dog ripper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog ripper is the same grateful dog cut
pollinated by Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are having amazing success with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the the lemon sunrise?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is lemon jeffery which is a feminized
plant crossed to the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many examples of great plants
that have started with a feminized seed as
[SPEAKER_00]: the female side pollinated by a male plant
making amazing progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your question is will there be any
problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be any intersex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not if the due diligence has been done
on that breeding and intersex plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: not involved in the creation of that
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should work out for you.
