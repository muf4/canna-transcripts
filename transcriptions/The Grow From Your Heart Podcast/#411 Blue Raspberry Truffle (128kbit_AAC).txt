[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's time for episode 411 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a nice fat dab of Samoa Kush
from Nomad Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says it contains 67.7% total
THC, not a super high or impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: number, but it was really potent and the
flavor and aroma was really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally go for a more THC heavy sativa
dominant style concentrate, but this one
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to have mellowed me out and made me
sit back in the chair a little bit and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of calmed me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I do have a great
episode planned for you, but before we get
[SPEAKER_00]: too far, let's do some shout outs for our
friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big shout out to
our friend David O'Quinn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to Ryan Schmidt,
a huge shout out to Riley Hanson,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
out to John Milk, a big shout out to Sam,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, another ganja grower shout
out to my friend Farmer John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast World, this episode is going to be
another strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following the podcast for a
while, you know that I like to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I have bred and feature them
here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed a lot of fine quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a male plant known as a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make some feminized crosses with
various selected females that are reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: and turned into males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus on
one of my new most recent and most
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the debut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you haven't heard about this one
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time we will talk about
blue raspberry truffle here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, pack up the bong,
roll up a fat joint, heat up the dab nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let's talk a little bit about blue
raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this episode originally comes out,
blue raspberry truffle will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle will not be
available until 4-20, and it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: released first at Oregon Elite Seed Bank,
and you can find them at OregonEliteSeeds
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you look for the blue
raspberry truffle around April 20th on
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will have very limited packs with
me at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're at the Dude Grows Cup on
April 13th at Cultivated Synergy,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have an opportunity to get some of
the first released packs of the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let things go at the event in
person, face to face, before some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors even have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be your first opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about blue
raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this blue raspberry truffle that I
keep talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle is, of course,
a cross of my Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a prized Arise male that I have
named King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use in many of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female pollinated
by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll briefly talk about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode 329, and I do a full feature
of the strain Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll briefly talk about it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female pollinated
by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat is kind of tropical,
kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is island sweet skunk, Hawaiian sativa,
and a Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got that tropical sativa flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice head buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really great growing plant,
and it is very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker male used in that cross is
Chem D crossed to Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem D has kind of a fresh tennis
ball, kind of a fresh rubber sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like swampy O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of piney, kind of gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got kind of a really unique funk to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that one for its funky flavors
and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a short, squatty structure with
really wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really contrasted that golden goat
quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bred those two together and I made
that Arise cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of those Arise seeds came a very
standout male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male has been known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon basically turbocharges
everything he pollinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a plant that has great flavor
and great trichome production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe doesn't grow the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And King Solomon will fix that growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives plants hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also increases potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also increases yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like King Solomon is a very special
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I breed him to so many
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quick rundown of King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is the male I used in the
blue raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the female that we
used in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm good at building suspense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to know what was the girl
in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female that I used for the blue
raspberry truffle cross was the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that blueberry cookies is actually a
cross of blueberry Tahoe and platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very, very blueberry dominant,
kind of a blueberry Skittles, a nerds kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a flavor and a really funky aroma going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working for a little while with
the blueberry cookies and I have only seen
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran the blueberry cookies in
commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it in my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen it grown in other grows by
growers who are not as experienced by
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and it always does a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry cookies was one of my
favorite strains to smell, to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke, to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quickly fell in love with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cross it to my prized Arise King
Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the blueberry cookies with my
Arise male and the offspring are
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell early on in the veg phase
that these plants were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had amazing growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their structure was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were perfectly shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early in veg, I could smell a
blueberry, sort of a rubbery tennis ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a burnt muffin sort of a thing
coming off of these plants in their veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super excited to get these plants
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they went into flower,
the aromas only intensified.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants took off when I put them in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did get kind of tall kind of quickly,
but we're going to talk about the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the aromas and smoking
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it was growing, it smelled like
blueberries and almost like hot chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: or really dark chocolate, which is where
it got the truffle name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that blueberries with something
sour, which is where the raspberry comes
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that dark chocolate was kind of
truffly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffles was what I thought
of the first time it got real musty in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of got a sort of a blue
Skittles or a pack of nerds and dark
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate and blueberries is really
dominant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where it got the name is the
blue raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it got older in flower, the truffly
smell that chem dog, OG Kush, Joseph OG
[SPEAKER_00]: really came out in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started off sweeter and more candy
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes got a little bit
more of the truffly flavor toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plants, honestly, I let go too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have cut some of them down a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there is a nice window with
some of the phenotypes where it will
[SPEAKER_00]: change from that blueberry thing sort of
over to a mustier, more of the truffly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a foot kind of a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it kind of transfer into that
phase at the end, if you let it go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit too long, we're going to talk
about those phenotypes here in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the grow went on, many of the
phenotypes got a little bit mustier is the
[SPEAKER_00]: word that I like to use for a little more
truffly, a little more dark chocolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little earthy is kind of the flavor and
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should be saying is earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a little more earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I cut them down, it kind of
seemed like I just broke open the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry turp jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just blueberries and raspberries
and kind of a skittly flavor just filled
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy that it produced that much of
a different aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it grew, it started off with the
real blueberry raspberry sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it got older, many of the phenotypes
shifted to sort of an earthy truffle kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them did maintain their blueberry
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the phenotypes
and the division of that in just a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I cut it down, it exploded with
blue raspberry nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember those blue lollipops we used
to get back in the day that would turn
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole face blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor and aroma was very reminiscent
of that blue raspberry lollipop and a
[SPEAKER_00]: package of nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cut it down, I dried it, I cured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I cured it, I noticed that that musty
smell kind of got lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it lightened, it balanced out the
blueberries and the earthy smell really
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really balanced them out very
well toward the words blue raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: truffle just made more sense as time went
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started smelling it, I was like,
that's blue raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as time went on, it just proved itself
that that name was perfect for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that it smells and
tastes like a blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dried it, I cured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, before we get there, let me say
this stuff destroys a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grinder will be sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your fingers will be super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some extremely resinous and sticky
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I smoked it, I tried to roll a
joint and it got really sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I needed to let it dry a little
longer, but it was really sticky,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to try again and put it in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bowl tasted even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that blueberry thing come out right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you hit it, it was like,
ooh, that is blueberry skittles or
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry nerds or something really
blueberry, like a blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the, not like the real blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like fake blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if there were a blueberry air
freshener, that's what it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think it's fresh fruity blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This smells like straight up fake
blueberries and candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they had blueberry candy turps at
the candy store, that's what it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not like a fruit blueberry it is
like a very powerful, almost a sour
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry candy and it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as that green bowl started to
burn, that blueberry aroma hit the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like you cracked open a blueberry
air freshener and then it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ooh, that's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on the exhale, that's where that
warm cushy flavor comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it filled the room with sweet
blueberries and then right after,
[SPEAKER_00]: cushioned truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me intense cotton mouth
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tasted so good that I did not want
to drink anything to wash away that
[SPEAKER_00]: complex flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really neat when you've got,
you go, hmm, blueberry, ooh, and
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain has to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going, oh, how did I get such a
range of flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that wide range of flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very reminiscent of some of the old
blueberry strains I've smoked back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very similar to the blueberry cookies
mom that it came from, but also that
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise, it took that Chem D flavor and it
really put the tennis balls of the Chem D,
[SPEAKER_00]: that chocolate flavor that Chem D
sometimes has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really brought that out into this
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cotton mouth happens instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head high comes on super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit it, you're like, oh,
I'm high now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoke a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to notice a bowl or a joint of flour
come on that quickly, that means that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the head buzz comes on quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of went behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my eyes feel heavy, but not like
droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were being pushed on kind of
intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it kind of slowly drifts over my
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went from my brain and then it was
like, oh, I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I felt it like kind of irradiate
down my spine, across my shoulders,
[SPEAKER_00]: down my arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it worked its way all the way
down my back to my hips and my knees and
[SPEAKER_00]: my shoulders are kind of where a lot of my
pain and stress are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my tension in my shoulders,
into my gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my knees are just stressed
because I'm old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets to the knees and it relaxes
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my whole body just feels like it's in
a cozy blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I described it the other day as a
superhero cape because it just made me
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I want to get up and do some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody's like, what do you want to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get up and do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really have any goals or
anything, but it felt like I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something, damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads throughout your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel all warm and tingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some pain, I'm sure that
this one would be great for your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a basic smoke report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first sample, I did not let dry long
enough, but once I let it dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, it really had a great,
amazing flavor and it burned beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit about the
growing aspect of our blue raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, the first question
people ask is, how long does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend nine weeks, maybe a
little longer, but you probably don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to go past 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 72 days at the absolute longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would take any longer
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone 72 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, some of the phenotypes had gone
too long at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets a little bit tall, but she makes
huge colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen pictures of a rise,
if you've seen pictures of the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, you know that both of those
plants make monstrous top colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will get tall on you quickly,
but it is worth it because they put out
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have big fat chunky colas that
are covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen photos of the blueberry
cookies, if you've seen photos of any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the arise crosses, all of them are coated
in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will put on a layer of crusty
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have giant colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants grow with what I call hyper
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had a few people tell me that
plants crossed with the rise grow too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly for them and they need to reduce
their veg time by at least one full week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for fast growing hyper
vigorous tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will take off on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they do like to be topped and spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were the type of person that tops
your plants, you can top these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make a giant glory cola at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not top them, if you choose to
top them, you're going to get nice
[SPEAKER_00]: branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to spread out very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a nice full canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants can take some abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to be cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to be popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to be twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants like to get worked into a
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a net or something like
that, I highly recommend a trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you're going to need some sticks,
some stakes, some cages, or something to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep some of these taller, bigger buds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get big, they may get a little
bit floppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you top them and spread them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to spread out my plants kind of
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to get a little bit bushy
on you when you top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffles can take a shit
ton of nutrients in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have only grown this plant in
soilless mix and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to feed it too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it a little bit too much shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't react too poorly to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a beating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to push my plants and I
really like to see what they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue raspberry truffle can really take
a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really take abuse in both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle will react a little
bit poorly if she gets too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get taco leaves and it will stunt
her growth and she will get extra
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's already a stretchy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get her too hot, she will start
stretching on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to get away from herself and
away from the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to stretch out and find some
fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will get growing when she gets too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also does that if you cram her in with
too many other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to be up high, so she will grow,
give her space, top her, maybe give her a
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis to hold her down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it gets too hot, you'll get taco
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get massively slowed production
from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get it too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure at that point somebody's
going to say, what is too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many variables to think about
when you ask that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phenotype are you working with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the rest of your VPD looking like
in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be able to take more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got CO2, I'm not exactly sure
what to tell you on what is too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will react poorly to too much
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you're going to see is
those leaves at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start pointing straight up at the
light and then they will start tacoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they're praying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is telling you I'm a little bit
too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please raise the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or please top me or please bend me down so
I'm not getting a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basic grow breakdown of the
blue raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine to 10 weeks, 10 weeks should be
plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that she can take a lot of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't burned this plant and I have
tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she can take a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest giving it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this plant, you are more likely to
underfeed than you are to overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you give her lots of space,
spread her out and make sure she doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get too hot because that is the one thing
she really does not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen a lot of beautiful colors come
from the blue raspberry truffle,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of dark colors, a lot of dark
purples, a lot of gold and amber colors
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really makes gorgeous colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to drop the temperatures
late in flower in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last few days, I will really
bring out the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really saw a lot of color changing when
the room got colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I did throw a couple of plants in
the dark for 24 hours and they turned gold
[SPEAKER_00]: and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will give you a lot of beautiful
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the temperatures down low toward the
end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think you will see the beauty
come out of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen powdery mildew on the blue
raspberry truffle yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another bonus is this plant loves to make
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of resin on the blue
raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see phenotypes that it looks like
the trichomes are fighting for space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move into talking about
phenotypes of blue raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really stable hybrid in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes are blueberry
cookies dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very skittlesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say skittlesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell like a bag of skittles,
more like a bag of blue raspberry candies
[SPEAKER_00]: or possibly those blue nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you eat blue nerds candies,
that's kind of what it smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sweet and sour and blueberry
and delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have some phenotypes that are
blueberry cookies dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will also have some Arise dominant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more of a lemon,
more of a citrus type of a thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is very Arise golden goat dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since the parent plants are very
similar, it's going to be kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the difference between maybe a
blueberry cookies dominant phenotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: an Arise dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those plants have a similar
structure, a similar leaf shape and size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very different, but they are very
similar to a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both got long, skinny,
pointy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both grow tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both grow kind of branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing you're going to notice
is the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is really going to be what
stands out the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yes, you are going to see phenotypes
that will show you golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see phenotypes that will show you
the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross on the blueberry cookies is the
blueberry Tahoe and platinum cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see platinum cookies
come out a little bit because you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find recessive traits from the
grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, these plants are going
to look like Arise that smells a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to find blueberry cookies
dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are going to find Arise dominant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the mix, we are going to find
50-50 phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise phenotypes are going to be a
little airier, a little fluffier,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little more loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may find that the Arise dominant
phenotypes will have a tropical citrus
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also notice that the Arise
dominant phenotypes are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that that comes from the
Joseph OG side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the blueberry cookies dominant
phenotype seems to stay a little shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: and the node spacing seems to stay a
little bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also see a little bit larger leaf
from the blueberry cookies dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that comes from the platinum
cookie side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the Tahoe OG has fairly large
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is one phenotype that is really
tight, really sharp-looking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got little whiter leaves toward the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get thinner leaves toward the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gets a nice menorah shape
toward the bottom, and it's got one glory
[SPEAKER_00]: cola that grows out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a blueberry skittle sort of a
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the blueberry cookies dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is another phenotype that is
very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a comparison, it is hard to tell
the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a big glory bud, but that bottom
branching will be a little bit stretchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a little bit further apart in
node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't have the blueberry skittles
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have more of a tropical sweet
flavor along with that earthy flavor as a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the golden goat dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 50-50 is the one that smells like
blueberries and dark chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the blue raspberry truffle scented
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower leaves are a little broader as
it gets taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets the thinner leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves get real long and skinny toward
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite phenotype of the blue
raspberry truffle is the one with the
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter pedials.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are closer to the plant,
the bigger sun leaves, if they're closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant, that is one of my favorite
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further out those pedials get,
the more I feel like you're getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're getting more of the
50-50, more of the desirable one when we
[SPEAKER_00]: get in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the leaves will hang down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed more of the chocolate flavor
comes from the plants with the leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some that have droopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean the plant is thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not mean the plant is
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait of the daybreaker male,
which I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't pop up a lot, but it comes
out in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see the leaves drooping,
that has potential of being a very
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate, maybe a tennis ball,
maybe a rubbery sort of a smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got that blueberry cookies
dominant, the real jagged, the real sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: looking one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the arise dominant phenotype,
the one that opens up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super fluffy either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has more airspace than that
blueberry cookies dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more of a tropical smell,
longer pedials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the golden goat dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is that beautifully balanced mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice tight buds, that blue raspberry
truffles sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the blueberry skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the chocolate kind of background
going on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the desirable sought after
phenotype, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a phenotype that I have
dubbed the weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one may be great for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a little bit airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a blueberry golden goat,
but it kind of gets a little bit fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect it is probably a blueberry
Hawaiian sativa is kind of what we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps maybe like a blueberry Hawaiian
sativa is what kind of came out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it gets tall and it gets a little
bit fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tighten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would make great concentrates
because it tastes very, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings out a really sweet blueberry
sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of a fruity,
fruity, fruity, fruity, fruity,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity, fruity, fruity, fruity little
tiny, tiny bud sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it just wants to build calyxes
on calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like the old doctor or Dr.
Grinspoon used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be real calyxy, but it also
fluffs out like a diesel plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably comes from the Chem D
somewhere along the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the phenotypes you're going
to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the buzz is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my breeder breakdown on my new
blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are into unique aromas,
if you're into blueberries, if you're into
[SPEAKER_00]: fruitiness, if you're into skittles,
if you're into earthiness, there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of opportunities for great phenotypes in a
pack of blue raspberry truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be available at the Dude Grow Show
on April 13th at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, your next opportunity
will be from Oregon Elite Seeds at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a full lineup of irie genetic
seeds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and check out Oregon Elite
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into the search bar, type in irie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name may not be on the right on the
links yet because I'm fairly new to the
[SPEAKER_00]: website, but if you type it in,
it should pop up or type in Arise or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, and it will bring up
the irie genetics line.
