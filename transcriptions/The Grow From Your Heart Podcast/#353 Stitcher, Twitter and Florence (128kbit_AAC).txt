[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 353 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Ross
DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat
spliff, pack up a fresh pole, put some
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh water in the bomb or start heating
up that dab nail because it's time for a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 353.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm taking dabs of blueberry citron
fambrosia from Apothecary Farms in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is labeled as 74.8% THC and total
cannabinoids are 87.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remarkable part about this concentrate
is the aroma and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like clementines, it smells like
sweet candied oranges rolled in sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it also has a hint of purple Laffy
Taffys in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high goes right to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me ridiculously ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to sit still long enough to
record a podcast, but I'm gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the size of the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it is labeled fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a four gram jar of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chunky diamonds in here are
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to admit it, but I've had to break
a couple of them apart to dab them because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are just too big for one dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be kind of a waste and it would
be the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm dabbing the blueberry citron
fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Apothecary Farms in Colorado Springs
and it tastes delicious and I do approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we want to go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher is a service where a lot of
people were attempting to listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, but it was kind of giving us
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who listen on Android devices
weren't able to listen on the Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: application while on the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say it again with confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have corrected all of the issues with
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should work on all devices at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested it on several devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has the exact device on which
Stitcher was failing and both of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes have worked there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this one works on Mike's phone that
is three in a row, I will feel like we
[SPEAKER_00]: have solved the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher just put out a brand new update,
so make sure you download the new update
[SPEAKER_00]: on Stitcher Radio and the show will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old episodes won't correct themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting at episode 351, Stitcher should
be repaired on all devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody at Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, big thanks to the support
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of work together to get that
problem solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big thank you to everybody who
politely and gently reached out to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, hey bro, your show is not working on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't know when there's a tech
issue on my website, on my podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: on my YouTube channel, on my social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm not aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those gentle notifications are
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I say this is just a one
man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics as all me from doing the
breeding, the selection, all the growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give a lot of the photography credit to
other folks when they take the pictures,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of the photography is mine
because I have the plants first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to take the first pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding, the growing, the
photography, the social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the email and dealing with vendors,
all of that is handled by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that company is just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm the grow from your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write all of the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I host and produce all of the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edit every single episode and I make the
videos for every single episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do all of the internet work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend that does a lot of the
website work, but for the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need his help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all of the internet work for the
podcast on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am running the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running I read genetics, the seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm somebody's dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a busy person, but often I say that
it is a one man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, honestly, I couldn't do a lot
of what I do without the backup and
[SPEAKER_00]: support from all of my social media
friends and my friends and family that are
[SPEAKER_00]: around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really allow anybody to put their
hands in the projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all my work and it's my love,
but I do allow them to support me in many
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do appreciate that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the ivory army,
the grow from your heart podcast family,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also all the people that come and help
me in numerous ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do say this is a one man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about the podcast,
I do need to give a shout out to Mike who
[SPEAKER_00]: comes over and contributes heavily and
also a big shout out to every guest who
[SPEAKER_00]: has ever been on here and a big shout out
to everybody who sends me emails and
[SPEAKER_00]: social media questions and comments and
also everybody on the Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: because I get a lot of podcast material
from those resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to come up with show content two
episodes a week out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of your guys's questions,
a lot of the comments, that does inspire
[SPEAKER_00]: great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you and thank you for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was trying to get at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, speaking of listener generated
content, my next segment comes from my
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes back, I asked if you could
smoke a joint with anybody living or dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: who would you choose to smoke with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of creative and interesting
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just run right through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first response comes from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by somebody who calls
themselves MorningDew72.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, would have been cool to smoke
with Robin Williams, Circa, Mork,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mindy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin Williams was always hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was extra funny during the Mork and
Mindy years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get stoned with Robin Williams and watch
him get goofy and make those funny,
[SPEAKER_00]: silly noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate that reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the input, MorningDew72.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another screenshot with a whole
bunch of great replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, dude, could you imagine
tripping with Jimi Hendrix?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because this person said they would
like to smoke with Jimi Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, if you're going to
hang with Jimi, are you sure all you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is smoke some weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that conversation got a little out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to TipTopMagoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about smoking with Jimi Hendrix,
and we also talked about taking it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little further with Jimi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hanging out with Jimi,
you do as Jimi do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next reply comes from my friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Clint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint says, Trump today to try and figure
out what his game plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people want to know what
the fuck his game plan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to see Trump nice and stoned,
that may change him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may open his eyes and may make him on
our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just realized I said it would open
his eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it will make his eyes droopy and
open his heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward with Twitter replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says from our friend Aldridge,
it says, my pops whenever and wherever I
[SPEAKER_00]: never got the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew a lot of people would reach out and
say that they wish they got a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with their old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of expected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much respect for that reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that one, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our other friend, Damian,
who goes by free market capitalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of spelled awkwardly on Twitter,
but you'll find if you look for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: he says, Ernest Hemingway in Paris in the
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a great response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was so much different in the
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you'll find everybody is more calm
and more peaceful and the conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: are more rich and people actually look you
in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no cell phone to pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everybody's wondering what's
happening on Twitter and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be so much better to sit down and
have a talk then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do at the end of the
hangout when you can't pull out your phone
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a little Instagram shot with
Hemingway?
[SPEAKER_00]: You going to be all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the only downfall to
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I hope you get to live out your
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope one day we get to get some time
travel devices and we get to legally take
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis with us to the past and go
smoke out our heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward because this is
going to be weird quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Couch Glow on Twitter said he
would like to smoke with Terrence McKenna
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely like to be a part of
that smoke session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence McKenna was an activist and a
spokesperson for psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have been an ethno-pharmacologist,
may have been his official title.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any research before the show,
but I think that's what he went by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence McKenna was all about
psychedelics and the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and opening your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not smoke a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said the best way to consume cannabis
was to go for long periods of time without
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and then when you do smoke,
smoke as much as you can possibly handle
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's how you smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a different approach than most of
us, but he went extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you didn't smoke for 60 days
and you went in and took a giant dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how psychedelic and brand new that
would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his smoking experience every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence McKenna would be a great smoking
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't get him so high he can't
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few puffs to open both of your
minds and then you can sit there and have
[SPEAKER_00]: that talk about spirituality and
psychedelia and all the things that he
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been able to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, he spoke a lot, so I'm sure you've
heard a lot of his stuff by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that one, Couch Glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next one says, I read an article about
Willie Nelson before this podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I imagine I have to say, oh,
Willie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from our friend, Mileman5280.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I would get at least one Willie
Nelson, so that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy your smoke sesh with old
Willie one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard Willie could smoke some weed,
so come prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next tweet is from TheCanicrat,
and he said, my dad passed in 99,
[SPEAKER_00]: so not a fair pick, but I tweeted Bourdain
a bunch of times, jokingly inviting him to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn one before he passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, he means Anthony Bourdain,
who recently passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very creative person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very open-minded and he's been a
lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a practitioner of Brazilian jujitsu,
and he does consume cannabis regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he would have known how to just chill
out and smoke and have a conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go eat some weird food with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go do some Brazilian jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit more to this tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, one more to break the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more dead would be Joe Strummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more alive, Rasta Jeff420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his choices were his pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a lot of people chose their
pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he chose Anthony Bourdain,
which would have been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he chose Joe Strummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would always be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rock stars are going to be fun to
smoke with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then his next choice, Rasta Jeff420.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an honor, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honored to be in that list of great
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, let's get together and take some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, I'll be around for a little
while, so you got some time to plan that
[SPEAKER_00]: trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the great tweet,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we've got any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aldridge says, congrats on five years of
consecutive Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's random, but hey,
dude, thanks for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also asked, when you smoke with your
favorite person or with your person of
[SPEAKER_00]: choice, what strain are you going to
smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, as I record this, I've only gotten
one reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reply was strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came from our friend,
Free Market Capitalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big thanks to everybody who sent me
replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I will ask the question once
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never too late to send in your
Twitter replies or you can email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were able to smoke with any one
person living or dead, who would you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to smoke a joint with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that person is dead, what era of
their life would you bring them back from
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you choose to smoke with that person
right before they got famous or when they
[SPEAKER_00]: got famous or right at the height of their
career?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever it is, you know when you want to
join them for a smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to know what strain you're
going to smoke with this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to roll up to smoke
with your one favorite smoke buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartatahotmail.com or
find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I guess it's only fair that I share
with you who I would choose to smoke with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said in a previous episode that
the person I would choose to smoke with
[SPEAKER_00]: who is dead would be my Gramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to go back somewhere between
1995 and 2005 and smoke with my Gramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a really cool old guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think around 95 to 2005 was when I was
becoming adult enough to enjoy an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with him and smoke a joint
with him and be mature enough to take it
[SPEAKER_00]: as an adult thing, not like a
disrespectful kid getting high with the
[SPEAKER_00]: old man sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there would have been a different
level of respect around then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he was in good health at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was physically and mentally doing
pretty well in that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's about a 10-year time frame
where I think I really would have enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a joint with my Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have been my dead pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: My alive pick, that took a little bit of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Colorado, where we get a lot
more opportunity to smoke with a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in the cannabis industry,
which gives me even more opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a six-foot-five white guy with
dreadlocks almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives me a little more opportunity
to smoke with more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if I go to a reggae concert at a
theater or a small club, I can just walk
[SPEAKER_00]: right past security because they think I'm
in the band or part of the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I take good herb to a reggae show,
when the show's over, I walk backstage and
[SPEAKER_00]: go smoke with the reggae band.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy being Rasta Jeff
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've made friends with some folks at
ComedyWorks, where I may end up in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of smoke sessions with comedians before
and or after comedy shows allegedly made
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't want to get anybody in any
trouble, but everybody has seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of Doug Benson and myself smoking
after the shows at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've made friends with a lot of
comedians like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them don't want pictures of us
smoking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it doesn't happen in a place
where I can take a picture, but I do get
[SPEAKER_00]: spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked hash with Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked countless times with Doug
Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a few comedians so high that
they had to delay the show and go on late.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I was the only guy with weed and
a pipe at the High Plains Comedy Festival,
[SPEAKER_00]: where a lot of headliners wanted to smoke
some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got spoiled that day and got to meet
a lot of mine and your favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to just sit in the green room and
just smoke out everybody that came through
[SPEAKER_00]: that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend who put me in that
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows who he is and he probably is
listening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not want his name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is I have smoked with a lot
of musicians and comedians and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people I want to smoke with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one person at the top of my list that
I would like to smoke with that I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: had the opportunity to shake his hand or
smoke some weed with him would be Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to just meet Joe and smoke
and have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be super honored to be on the
show, but there's no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Joe Rogan has always had my attention
for years before he got super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to his comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching his videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching the podcast since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be an honor to smoke with Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would probably be my number one pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: A close second would be Snoop Dogg because
who doesn't want to smoke a joint with
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Snoop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how fun that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Snoop is hilarious and he's super
chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could just smoke a joint and just
sit there and laugh at shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably get some food, listen to some
good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first choice of living person would
be Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: My backup plan would be Snoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could time travel, I would try to
smoke a joint with my Gramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine what's going to happen when we
time travel and go back in the day and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke dabs with these people who aren't
even familiar too much with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yo, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck happened to weed in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of the podcast was inspired
by my friends who were worried about and
[SPEAKER_00]: who were dealing with Hurricane Florence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with a friend who was very
concerned with how to keep his plants
[SPEAKER_00]: alive during the hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: If power goes out, what is he going to do
to keep the environment dialed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is he going to do to keep the lights
on schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a couple of pieces of advice
that I feel like really made him at ease
[SPEAKER_00]: during this emergency time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my friend's main concern was
interrupting the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not want to disrupt the current
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the middle of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows that if he disrupts that
light cycle too much, he gives the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to turn into
hermaphrodites, which will seed his crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will potentially cost him income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here was my main piece of advice to
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are tolerant of interruptions
of the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our plants are not tolerant to
interruptions of the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a power failure during the
light cycle and the lights go off for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while, your plants will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get that light energy and
they'll miss that growth for that amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of time, but it will not turn them into
herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the opposite, if your plants get light
during their night cycle, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely risking issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are risking causing hermaphrodite
flowers and seeds in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first piece of advice was don't
worry too much about interruptions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day cycle, but focus strongly on
interruptions of the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next piece of guidance was that if
they're getting frequent interruptions in
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity and the light is going on for
two hours and then maybe off for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and then on for 15 and then off
during the day cycle, it may be best just
[SPEAKER_00]: to unplug that light until you get the
electrical issue solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant would react better to
just having a long dark period than a day
[SPEAKER_00]: where I had two hours of light and then 15
minutes of dark and then 15 minutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: light and then some random time of dark
and then the lights went off for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of minutes and then they came back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had our normal 12 hour dark
cycle and the lights came on for about an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and then they went off again randomly
and then they got back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just leave the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having them come on and on and off and on
like that, those will probably cause more
[SPEAKER_00]: issues than just an extended dark period
until the problem is solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that's going to put stress on your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having the hot bulbs reignite is not good
for the bulbs or the ballasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: so avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend leaving on the fans and
the blowers until the very last minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide to unplug the lights because
they're flickering, leave the blowers
[SPEAKER_00]: plugged in because you still want airflow
in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to get stale and it's
not going to hurt the fans and blowers too
[SPEAKER_00]: much if they go off and come on too
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bulbs and ballasts that we're
going to do damage to and it's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are going to get annoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like it if I just walk in the
room and turn the lights off randomly and
[SPEAKER_00]: then walk back by and turn them back on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd piss you off eventually too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got flickering, if you've got
intermittent power failures, just unplug
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights until the power is fixed and
the plants will probably like you for that
[SPEAKER_00]: more than they would like you if you just
let them get flickered off and on through
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is you may
get a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been in a hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what this is going to be
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you electrically safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just unplug things anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have the chance of a lot
of water coming into that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were evacuated or if you feel like
the water is getting close, unplug your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff so that the ballast and the bulbs
aren't plugged in when the water comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how bad it's going to get,
but if you were evacuated unplug your shit
[SPEAKER_00]: before you leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unplug everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just go turn off the breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flip the breaker in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that there's no power going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're in veg, you're going to need
some light on your plants or they will
[SPEAKER_00]: start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will start to flower within 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will need 48 hours or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't get some light on them,
they may start the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your veg plants don't need a lot of light
for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prevent them from flowering,
if you have a strong battery powered
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight or one of those industrial
flashlights that takes the square battery,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big square battery, if you've got one,
you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that type of flashlight,
you can shine that over your plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: three, maybe seven, maybe 10 minutes at
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll keep them awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that every six hours or so,
they'll go, oh, we don't need to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in there and you wake them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just trigger them to wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it takes a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little while for them to fall
back to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't ever get the idea that
they've gotten 12 hours of uninterrupted
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness and they will not start to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go in there every six hours or so
and just shine a bunch of bright light on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you may not have electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm recommending flashlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try the weak flashlight on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll work if it's all you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can still charge your phone
with your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a little bit of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that little flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to depend on the size of the
plants, the age of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics, and a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one way to prevent those plants
from going into flower during a power
[SPEAKER_00]: outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advice for how to handle this
hurricane season and random power outages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important piece of advice is to
make sure that you, your loved ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your pets are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say evacuate, don't be a stubborn
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evacuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to get out of there so that
you don't get hurt and then nobody else
[SPEAKER_00]: gets hurt trying to rescue your dumb ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out of there when they say
evacuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your family and take care of
your pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need to help somebody else out,
do what you can and be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my hurricane and interrupted
light cycle advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have problems or you suspect you'll
have repeated problems, just unplug it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you will save yourself some headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I know these episodes have been
short lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to not be so rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to keep a lot of info and
a lot of details into the show without a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sidetrack crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do apologize if the episodes feel
short to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's better to have a short
episode that is to the point than a rambly
[SPEAKER_00]: episode with a bunch of crap for people to
fast forward through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get back to the grow lessons on the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to get these Twitter replies
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to get to this hurricane
question while it was kind of relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do understand that I've put out a
couple of really short episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under 30 minutes is really short in my
opinion, but I feel like those episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: were right to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep the grow lessons
nice and tight like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be episodes like these where I
come hang out and get rambly, but the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons are going to be a little tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the episodes don't require a long time,
I'm just going to do a short episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee there will be longer episodes
because I have some highly detailed grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons coming your way very soon.
