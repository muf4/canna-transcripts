[SPEAKER_03]: the dude grows cup come say hello once
again check DGC cup comm for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: information now Let's work our way into
the question and answer portion of today's
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast I don't know if you can hear it in
my throat In my voice, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about it too much because if you
didn't notice it's not a big deal,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Got a little bit of a sinus head cold
throat thing going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the episode I'm recording after
the 420 weekend humble brag here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go see sublime Yeah, that's
right, bro sublime with Bradley's son
[SPEAKER_03]: Jacob Doing the front job there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go see sublime at a small club in
Denver Mike and I got to go is really
[SPEAKER_03]: random sublime was scheduled to do a show
here at Red Rocks on 418 I believe and the
[SPEAKER_03]: West Weather fucked that all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they postponed the show for three or
four days sublime was in town.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were bored They wanted to play they
threw a kind of a surprise show at a
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller Once again, excuse all that they
threw a show at a smaller venue in Denver
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to go see sublime at a small
show a small club in Denver with Mike that
[SPEAKER_03]: was on 419 That's when all of this throat
and sinus chaos began.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked two joints in the morning We
smoked two joints at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked two joints in the evening in the
afternoon We still didn't feel alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was two or more maybe four or six
more joints There was times of peace and
[SPEAKER_03]: times of war.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we smoked then as well We smoked two
joints before we smoked two joints and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we fucking dabbed a little bit more
So my whole my smoking section for my
[SPEAKER_03]: whole body it notices it and it needs a
day off from smoking So I think tomorrow
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna not smoke We're gonna take a
little break drink a lot of water get some
[SPEAKER_03]: juice and vitamins in me get these
problems fixed That was disgusting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of apologize for doing that But uh,
where was I even fucking saying dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what I was rambling
about anymore Excuse me for all this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and the voice is where I think I was
headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to see sublime, dude This is the
episode after 420 is where I think I was
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to see sublime Then it was 420 then
it was Earth Day after that or no,
[SPEAKER_03]: then it was Groundation Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a Rastafari, you understand
about Groundation Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna teach you about that today
So we had sublime on 419 then we had 420
[SPEAKER_03]: then we had Groundation Day Then the next
day was Earth Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to an Earth Day celebration
there My my sinuses and my my whole
[SPEAKER_03]: respiratory thing and needs a day off
happy 420 everybody, but holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went hard this year I don't know what
the fuck I was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where I was We're gonna do
the question and answer portion part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a website That website most of
you know by now is ieregenetics.com That
[SPEAKER_03]: is my main website If you go to that
website, there are a lot of cool places to
[SPEAKER_03]: click around click around find some cool
shit You just got to poke around if you
[SPEAKER_03]: scroll now if you Scroll to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions If you click on that tab,
[SPEAKER_03]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the option to send me a grow
question If I read your grow question here
[SPEAKER_03]: on the podcast I will send you a coupon
code for a free pack of seeds off of my
[SPEAKER_03]: vending website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read direct com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right There's two websites lots of
reasons for that But today's first
[SPEAKER_03]: question that came off of the grow help
tab at I read direct com Came from our
[SPEAKER_03]: friend who wants to be called crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up crispy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never related more with the name,
but I feel crispy today not complaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: But wow feel crispy We're gonna make a
quick show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna make it sound good crispy's
question is a two-part question the first
[SPEAKER_03]: part I answered on a recent episode the
second part We're gonna touch on this and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna get a few questions out pretty
quickly today We're gonna not try to dwell
[SPEAKER_03]: on these questions too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm rambling today You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question goes what up rasta Jeff two
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you count week one of flower as soon as
you Flip yes, we've covered this just in
[SPEAKER_03]: case you weren't listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: This person is asking when is day one of
flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're switching the light from 12 12 or
from 18 6 or 19 5 or 24 gonna flip it to
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 12 the day you do that That is day one
of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is day one the day you change the
timer The first night that those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: get a short night or a long night a short
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is your first day of flower We've
covered that day one is day one the second
[SPEAKER_03]: part.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: on defoliation My answer is yes do that do
that with strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I defoliate semi heavily in my opinion
Honestly, I've been a little bit lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been defoliating medium I should go
much harder, but it is time-consuming and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a couple plants in the back My big
ass can't really get to right now to
[SPEAKER_03]: defoliate them the way I would like so
they're a little bit furry It looks like a
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s bush in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to defoliate I recommend in a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I defoliate quite heavily Don't hit one
plant And strip it at a level 10 and then
[SPEAKER_03]: move to the next plant and strip it Go in
a spiral around the entire grow do this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant at a level 2 this plant level 2 this
plant level 2 Get them all at a level 2
[SPEAKER_03]: then go back through and do them all to a
level 4 level 5 strip them pretty good as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as you're comfortable with Any leaf
with the big purple petiole comes right
[SPEAKER_03]: off any leaf I can strip off easily Comes
right off any leaf blocking light from
[SPEAKER_03]: getting to a lower bud site probably comes
right off I don't need that much blockage
[SPEAKER_03]: that much shade in there So I do a lot of
defoliation the reason I'm telling you to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it in a rotation is Because if you and
this is gonna vary on the size of your
[SPEAKER_03]: room the amount of plants keep in mind to
have a commercial cultivation background
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think on a larger scale sometimes But
if you go and you strip row one down and
[SPEAKER_03]: rows three and four are still looking like
a 70s bush You're gonna have a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: fluctuation in humidity levels in that
room This plant is gonna have this section
[SPEAKER_03]: is gonna be a lot more damp a lot more
humid in the room The VPD is gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: funky over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna Be drier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna have different effects on the
plant If you've got sensors hanging in the
[SPEAKER_03]: room now your equipment's gonna be coming
off and going on all random It's not sure
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening because you've created
microclamps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need more fans You need to adjust
things still gonna be a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: struggle So I do defoliate and I do it
heavily but I do it in a rotation and I do
[SPEAKER_03]: it with strategy I will lollipop the
bottoms of the plants clean them up
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on the room the light There's a
lot of fucking factors in there clean up
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottoms do some lollipopping then do
some pruning of those Sticks I'll clean
[SPEAKER_03]: off the bottom shave the legs Then I'll go
and start at the top and I'll do a heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: defoliation and try to get that light all
the way through the canopy Into all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's your opinion of defoliation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick answer fucking do it second answer
do it with strategy work your way around
[SPEAKER_03]: the room Don't hit one plant and then
leave the rest real furry try to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: some strategy That is my advice anything
with a big petiole take it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plants can take a lot of
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do it Right at the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it on day one day 21 sometimes day
42 and then Keep going because now you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just getting ready to harvest anyway Why
not start pulling off leaves because we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need all those fucking leaves there
for harvest There are a lot of benefits to
[SPEAKER_03]: taking off these leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will slow down some processes It will
help with the VPD and that's where the
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew will go That's where the
spider mites will go if you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: hotels, then the people won't go stay in
the hotels So that is my opinion My dude
[SPEAKER_03]: crispy.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna keep this momentum going this
question also came from that grow help tab
[SPEAKER_03]: on irie genetics.com Thank you guys for
visiting the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: This question says I have a plant I want
to preserve in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh this came from our friend slick Rick I
should have said that slick Rick check
[SPEAKER_03]: your inbox because you've got a coupon
code for free seeds my dude It says I have
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to preserve in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a plant Perhaps you've got to
move you've got to take a break from
[SPEAKER_03]: growing you want to preserve this plant In
a seed form, maybe you just want it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: the box so that when the end of the world
comes Still have this plant in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever reason I understand it says I
don't keep a clone But I have 40 regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds of this cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you recommend I go about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a couple of options here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I am trying to not have to keep the
mom and I'm okay with slight variations in
[SPEAKER_03]: each seed But I want to avoid a lottery of
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got two two by four tents and I can't
run More than four plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got a plant you want to preserve
You've got 40 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you have the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have the specific plant that you
want to preserve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you found the phenotype or have you
got 40 seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't keep a clone, but I have 40
regular seeds of the cross either way
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna have to grow the seeds if
you've all you've got is the seeds You've
[SPEAKER_03]: got to grow them find your favorite
phenotype out of these seeds I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: run 20 of them and find the best and we've
got two options here find the best girl
[SPEAKER_03]: The girl that you like the most when you
smoke it That's what matters the most find
[SPEAKER_03]: the female that when you smoke it you go
Shazam That is the weed for me find that
[SPEAKER_03]: one Then also possibly potentially find a
male plant That would be another
[SPEAKER_03]: suggestion if you want to do it this way
find a male and a female Then or see we
[SPEAKER_03]: got we got three options here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got I keep opening up options in my
brain as we do this The easiest way find a
[SPEAKER_03]: boy and a girl and let them do their thing
and you will make more seeds There will be
[SPEAKER_03]: variation but you will find the traits
you're looking for in that offspring
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna make f2 there will be
variation in your f2 Another thing you
[SPEAKER_03]: could do find a couple of females you like
and pollinate them with that same male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an open pollination You're going to
get the lottery.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you don't want let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm not trying to have to Slight very
don't want to hunt a lottery of phenos.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gonna kind of give you a lottery So
don't do the open pollination,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's the way to find the fullest
expression of that Genotype you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: find all the phenotypes all the different
traits by doing one male to multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: females You'll find the open pollination
will give you the phenotype you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for and a lot of great other options Now
here is what I would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably where we should have
fucking started, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just jump right to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would grow those seeds Find the plant
that you really like find your favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this all is all about find the
best female Take two clones of that female
[SPEAKER_03]: the same exact plant you got two clones Of
it you're gonna have to take clones if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want this to work this way If you're not
going to take clones, the only way to
[SPEAKER_03]: really do this is to male female this but
Find the keeper plant that you like you
[SPEAKER_03]: need two clones of that plant at this time
to make this work You're gonna reverse one
[SPEAKER_03]: with silver thiosulfate or I haven't
shared this yet I've tried a product
[SPEAKER_03]: called elite X.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have tried it two times I've got 50%
success rate with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody told me the one plant I tried to
reverse was stubborn and it would not
[SPEAKER_03]: Work, I should have fucking listened so
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got good success with the product
called elite X.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not sponsor me It's an expensive
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I straight-up pay cash for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't advertised it I haven't talked
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't said that that's what I use on a
public forum at all before It is called
[SPEAKER_03]: elite X as a reversal spray either use
silver thiosulfate or elite X and reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: one of your plants that plant will then
make pollen put that pollen on the other
[SPEAKER_03]: copy of that Plant put it into flower put
that pollen on the other clone what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do now What you do now is make s1
seeds of that plant whatever this cross is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have got that you love We're
gonna call it slick Rick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've now made slick Rick s1s And those
will show very similar phenotypes to what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking for Depending on the plant
you'll find somewhere between 40 and 60
[SPEAKER_03]: percent of the offspring from this
Procedure will look just like the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that you place With the outliers will be
even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have some secrets You didn't know
about but some of the phenotypes will look
[SPEAKER_03]: just like the plant you started with so
you will find what you're looking for Now
[SPEAKER_03]: the catch is you said I don't keep calling
you didn't keep a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Maybe next time do keep clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I would do that You don't got
to do a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I would do I would run 20 of
these seeds I would find my favorite one
[SPEAKER_03]: out of this batch you could find your
favorite two if you want But I would focus
[SPEAKER_03]: on the favorite one find your favorite
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do three if you want This is up
to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's what we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna take your favorite one the
best one You got to pick one that is the
[SPEAKER_03]: best reverse that that is my advice So you
got to grow this plant find it keep a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone of it is the main fucking thing that
I skipped here Grow this plant get a clone
[SPEAKER_03]: grow all these get clones of them Keep
your favorite the favorite has got to be
[SPEAKER_03]: kept and then get two clones of that one I
know I'm fucking rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long week you guys get two
clones of your favorite plant And spray
[SPEAKER_03]: one and pollinate the other one with that
pollen You can also put other females in
[SPEAKER_03]: the room when you do this Just in case
there's another female that you really
[SPEAKER_03]: like or another strain that you like even
put a clone of that in the room Also,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna throw pollen Why not put
pollen on two three four or five other
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and see what you create I know you
want to make the preservation that will
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also By pollinating other plants you
get to do something that I find is fun
[SPEAKER_03]: when you pollinate plants Let's say I've
got a mango drink here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say we took strawberry and we
pollinated mango We're gonna get
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry mango, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We should maybe it's more strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's more mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna find out We don't know really
What that male plant is doing in that mix
[SPEAKER_03]: other than giving us strawberry flavor and
the female gives us mango That's what we
[SPEAKER_03]: get if I take that strawberry and makes it
to mango chocolate and lime And then we
[SPEAKER_03]: grow all of those we can find the
commonalities among the amongst those
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypes And that's coming from the male
that's coming from the strawberry if all
[SPEAKER_03]: three of these plants hold a similar trade
It couldn't have came from the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were different females.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the male is contributing to
this breeding project So that's why I like
[SPEAKER_03]: to pollinate multiple females when I'm
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm off on a side tangent That's not what
you asked at all, but that's part of what
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do if I was doing this When I'm
pollen chucking when I'm making plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: why not put something new experimental
brand-new?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck in there every time and see
what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of what I do is really thought out
sometimes it's a well, let's see what this
[SPEAKER_03]: one fucking does just curiosity just
because and Sometimes you guys those are
[SPEAKER_03]: the fucking winners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you want to preserve a plant
easiest way Make s1 seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I should have said in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for letting me ramble my dude
slick Rick I've got your in your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check your inbox for a coupon code for
free seeds from irie direct dot com All
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm high as giraffe pussy,
but we're gonna keep this show going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um This one also came from the grow help
tab on irie direct This one came from
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody who wants to be called new to
growing welcome to growing bro I hope it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going well for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question goes a lot like this It says
are silica additives like armor Sai and
[SPEAKER_03]: rhino skin Necessary in a drain to waste
coco coir and if they are how should they
[SPEAKER_03]: be used?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if this has been asked before
No, I am not familiar with answering any
[SPEAKER_03]: questions about silicates before the
question is Are silicate additives are
[SPEAKER_03]: they necessary?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that they're not required,
but they definitely do have benefits
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice more robust plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice thicker stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice plants that can handle
stress a little bit better If you forget
[SPEAKER_03]: to water they'll tolerate that a little
bit better if you give them too much heat
[SPEAKER_03]: They will tolerate that a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So The reason they're called shit like
armor and rhino skin is because they make
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants a let's armor It makes them a
little bit tougher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not required not necessary but
beneficial If you do it if it's in the
[SPEAKER_03]: budget go for it Next part of the
question, how would they be used?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would recommend the first piece of
advice when you have your reservoir your
[SPEAKER_03]: bucket your water Whatever you're mixing
into the silicate product goes first put
[SPEAKER_03]: that product in there first whatever
amount you choose to use Whatever dilution
[SPEAKER_03]: solution rate you're putting in there The
first thing to do is put in the silicate
[SPEAKER_03]: product very first put that in there and
then stir it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we stirring it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told which way I think we go
clockwise Stir it clockwise a few times
[SPEAKER_03]: get it moved up then stir it
counterclockwise a couple of times just to
[SPEAKER_03]: get it in there that does something
ionically all you Organic chemistry nerds
[SPEAKER_03]: fill me in I pay attention, but it doesn't
all stick you guys So put the silicate
[SPEAKER_03]: product in first stir it stir it the other
way Then start adding your other products
[SPEAKER_03]: after that then I would go with my base
nutrients Probably Cal Mag or not Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_03]: after that liquid karma is what I would do
after that, but work your way down the
[SPEAKER_03]: line But the potassium silicates go first
then the next thing I would think about is
[SPEAKER_03]: the recommended dosage Depending on what
product you're using Some of the brands I
[SPEAKER_03]: would use the recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are pretty strong and I would
use 50% Maybe start off with about 50% of
[SPEAKER_03]: the recommended dose feed your plants that
See what it does if it's not giving you
[SPEAKER_03]: any response increase to 75 if you don't
see any response Maybe go to 85 But by the
[SPEAKER_03]: time he gets 100, you'll see if you're
burning them and they'll start acting
[SPEAKER_03]: weird The ends of the leaves will turn a
little crispy brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaf tips will start pointing straight
up They might curl up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're using too much silicates,
the plants will let you know So start off
[SPEAKER_03]: with maybe 50 and then slowly increase the
application rate from there All right,
[SPEAKER_03]: my dude new to growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um It's not necessary but it helps and
I'll add it to the res first and start
[SPEAKER_03]: with a 50% of the Recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a good momentum going here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like giving away free seeds How long
have we been going?
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even been going that long We
got time for a lot more you guys This one
[SPEAKER_03]: also came from that girl help tab on irie
direct comm this one came from our friend
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to be known as cloud?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of Final Fantasy Use the
materia bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says hey Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the show Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned a ton watching you and the
dude grows big shout out to the dude
[SPEAKER_03]: grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check Dgccup.com come say hi
to me at the dude grow show the dude grows
[SPEAKER_03]: cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says first I want to say thank you,
sir I wouldn't be where I am now without
[SPEAKER_03]: our without your guidance and knowledge,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you I know I read a lot of comments
and stuff like that and they blow right
[SPEAKER_03]: past it that does stick that does mean a
lot to me So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's a recharge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bloom booster for a podcaster So
thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, there's more It says my question is I
bought a ton of nutrients at a grow store
[SPEAKER_03]: That was closing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's a good deal And now I
wonder How long I will be able to get away
[SPEAKER_03]: with store how long I would be able to get
away with storing these nutrients before I
[SPEAKER_03]: see negative effects on them Do the
products we use have a shelf life or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: a chemical that will be good for a decent
amount of time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up keep the knowledge going my bro
cloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the good question This is
something that people often overlook
[SPEAKER_03]: something that probably should have been
brought up a very long time ago those
[SPEAKER_03]: products all have A shelf life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't recommend more than a one-year
life on those products.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are sold in different bottles for a
reason they are and I was told I say this
[SPEAKER_03]: word wrong, but I learned it from a
Canadian so They are buffered and key
[SPEAKER_03]: lated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they she lated or key lated somebody
fucking you can't do it because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just gonna type it I'm never gonna know is
it key or she tell me in the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: comments because somebody always tells me
I'm saying it wrong If I say it either
[SPEAKER_03]: way, it's wrong So we're gonna say key
late because it sounds better to me today
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are buffered and key lated inside
that bottle if I'm saying it wrong,
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel fully are worded right now But they
are not meant to sit around for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time They're especially not meant to be
together for a reason they will bind they
[SPEAKER_03]: will get chunky Those things will start to
fall out of solution Have you ever grabbed
[SPEAKER_03]: a bottle of nutrients and shaken it up to
use it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounded like there was little
bottles are little chunks of salt in the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom of the bottle There are chunks of
salt that is your nutrients all the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: you paid for is now Bonded up at the
bottom and made a little cake and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: out you're pouring color To water into
your feed mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you're getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes There is about a one year shelf
life on most of those products and
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on how long they've been sitting
on that shelf The time may be ticking who
[SPEAKER_03]: knows I'd like to say a year from when you
open it But how long has it been sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that that like I said the time is
ticking from the minute they make that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit and start shipping it The time is
ticking so I wouldn't keep it around for
[SPEAKER_03]: more than one year Give it a sniff if it
smells bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some of that shit smells bad The day
you open it if your photosynthesis plus
[SPEAKER_03]: smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has gone bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's oh, man That one smells terrible,
but give it a smell It should smell
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar if it gets chunkier than it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably got a problem to it So that
is my advice and I am sticking to it my
[SPEAKER_03]: dude cloud Make sure you check your inbox
because like all of the great folks before
[SPEAKER_03]: you you've got a coupon code for free
seeds at Iri Direct calm boys and girls I
[SPEAKER_03]: have enjoyed the rapid-fire pace of this
show if you like it leave some Comments
[SPEAKER_03]: down below.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like your comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me go faster go slower Let me know if
you could tell that my voice just sounds
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible in the headphones But we do not
miss uploads.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one came from our friend lazy boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my buddy lazy boy I know the
feeling today, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question says how you doing Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the page and My question is can you
make seeds in a tent or is it better to
[SPEAKER_03]: make seeds outside in the Sun?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does it matter at all where you make
them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say make your seeds wherever you
can but indoors in a tent is my preferred
[SPEAKER_03]: environment Because I can control
everything in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a control freak when it comes to
growing outdoors I don't know if somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: in my block in my neighborhood Four miles
away is growing cannabis and put a male
[SPEAKER_03]: outside or maybe there's a hemp farm with
the male outside and my crop got
[SPEAKER_03]: pollinated with that random stray pollen
There's no way to prevent that detect that
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know That so I don't like growing
Outside for seed I would prefer to do that
[SPEAKER_03]: indoors in a tent environment I have
however had amazing success breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: plants outdoors in a greenhouse I rented a
greenhouse from a friend two years in a
[SPEAKER_03]: row We put a few plants out there and we
made impressive amounts of seeds the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: that came from the greenhouse Those seeds
were fatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were more robust They had a better
germination rate and there were a fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of them and it was basically Free to
grow it out outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to do maintenance and care and we
had to be there and I had to rent the
[SPEAKER_03]: space But there was no electrical cost and
that was huge because the lights are the
[SPEAKER_03]: most expensive part But the reason I
enjoyed that is because I was in a
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse and we had fans and we had
Eric's air exchange system to prevent
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen from coming in No pollen would come
in air was going out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had negative pressure blowing the air
out So that way we couldn't get accidental
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're gonna breed other than
indoors, I recommend some Sort of control
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of greenhouse environment but my
favorite is indoors that outdoors was
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome because it was very profitable It
made a lot of seeds, but also it was very
[SPEAKER_03]: easy to get problems out there So most of
my stuff is indoors nine I think 99% of
[SPEAKER_03]: what I've ever sold has been bred indoors
There were two crops of outdoor seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was no pollen Contamination
there because first of all all the progeny
[SPEAKER_03]: looked right and first of all we made
precautions to make sure no pollen would
[SPEAKER_03]: get in All right, my dude lazy Boy,
don't be too lazy because you got a pack
[SPEAKER_03]: of seeds coming You're gonna have to get
up and go to the mailbox and get the mail
[SPEAKER_03]: because you've got a gift from Rasta Jeff
Alright, ladies and gentlemen boys girls
[SPEAKER_03]: pimps hoes friends foes smokers growers
