the show since the upgrades since the what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did we wait for so long?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like something was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you busy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I busy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Both.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something happening that we
couldn't do a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, for some reason, we weren't
allowed to hang out for a long time and we
[SPEAKER_02]: are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, it's exciting to have Mike on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the two Mike set up to camera set
up that almost sounded like a dirty joke
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to two dudes coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done this in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited, bro.

we get too far.

find you on social media?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew do know that you would like
some more stalkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for me on Twitter,
you can find me at Nemo punk 15 on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the easiest two places to
find me on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I hope you wrote down a list.

both of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognize all of those names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, of course, I'm going to send
some of that sorry, we're touching knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the awkwardest moment in the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still learning the studio.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning the setup here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got these long legs and we're
both tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're gonna knee bump instead of
fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't trying to teach you in one
studio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was I going with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is I saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, famous, common names, common names
said famous, but common names in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's real supportive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm going to send Mike a few
bucks from my Patreon down his way because
[SPEAKER_02]: without Mike, the show wouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a lot of when he's not on the
show, he does give me a lot of supportive
[SPEAKER_02]: emails and behind the scenes behind I'm
like, Hey, Mike, I need guidance on this
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll always answer me and help me

[SPEAKER_02]: Also, thanks to all of the patrons for
these, the new microphone, the mic that
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is miking that is miked up miking mic

[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really good in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear me for the first time in two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, we try to get the zooms right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But zoom is zoom likes to fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I try real hard to get it correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good on my screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put it out and I'm like,
what do we just do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hopefully we sound as good and your
headphones as we do in ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to the patrons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Mike, the microphone, the cable,
the stand, the little power supply,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got a lot of cool stuff for Mike to be
on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got me a new fancy mic stand here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to the patrons that made that
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where the funding came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the patrons.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, this is the part of the
show where I usually save space for
[SPEAKER_02]: chatter, some stuff that we could shit
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have anything to ramble
about, we could jump into the main topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you'd like to say anything,
this is a good chance to open the show
[SPEAKER_02]: with some chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: No major chatter right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just smashing through 2022 already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what would be almost the end of
February.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of February.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will come out one week toward the end
of one week left in February when this
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our birthdays are coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spring is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's first quarter is almost over time to
start paying taxes and prep for prep for
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we feel like and sound like a couple
of old guys right now talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: weather and the passing of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Two Guys Coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Mike joins me, it's Two Guys
Coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a ramble cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty solid topic, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very specific and researched episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's got a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have an iPad full of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I look distracted into the iPad,
I'm not checking out OnlyFans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very impressive studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at the video and you're
like, what the fuck is Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does he look surprised?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything here is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time my eyes adjust to something
new, I see some new cool piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: That iPad setup is beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeps me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I know this is my steering
wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is driving right about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can all go awry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this sounds so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You adjusted the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched you adjust to the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't press record till I saw you get
comfy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it could be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you're used to it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are a little bit strong and I
can't see myself being recorded right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a different experience on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's half of my attention focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, pay attention to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, we're going to re-rangle
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to regroup you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the chatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only want to make this so long of a show
and they know how we can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this is, of course, episode
number 719.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did I want Mike here for 719?
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's address is 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: 719 is our area code.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call Mike or I,
the number is going to start in 719.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Mike, you may have that Denver
phone number still.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a 719 number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our numbers around here are 719.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 719 is our area code.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt it would be very appropriate to
dedicate a podcast episode to our city,
[SPEAKER_02]: to our area code.
[SPEAKER_02]: None other to help me do that than our
buddy, one of my best friends on the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike has been integral in the cannabis
evolution, revolution, legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: medical movement here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Mike has been a big part of my
development and growth as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: People call me a guru, a community leader.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those silly words that make me blush
when you say them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without Mike's contributions to the legal
side, the moral side, the ethical side,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just his broship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics, the podcast wouldn't be
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to have Mike on this show,
represent our city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, for sure, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I say that enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lawyers, the accountants, the fucking
business guys, they all live in the tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: houses made out of tiki-taki.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look just the same and they never
get no fucking credit, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm up here on camera with the lights in
my face all the time, getting all the
[SPEAKER_02]: love, getting all the praise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compliment each other in a way that
makes all of this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago, a spark got lit and now
we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had these dreadlocks for a long time
because I'm showing the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: These dreadlocks will be 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time this episode comes out,
these dreadlocks are 17 years old,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was uncomfortable and unprepared to go
speak at city council and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt the stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the expected response.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they're going to be like,
yeah, white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you want legal weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was the one with the balls,
the heart, the education, the presentation
[SPEAKER_02]: to go do that for our city, our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike influenced, shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a big part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helped right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the actual rules and regs were
hammered out in meetings that I somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: got picked to sit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dispensaries and grows follow today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home grow rules, dispensary rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it got like, we invented it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was coming to me and saying,
Hey bro, this is the grow rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, what's it proposing?
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the good and bad of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, Oh, that would ruin this
because of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a lot of times they would try to say
that each plant's going to harvest seven
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds and take 30 gallons of water a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could pull seven of them a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike would say, give me the real
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would give him like square footage
per night, how many grams I would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would take that to the people that
were actually making the rules and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what he really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Mike was, I wasn't going to go
there and say, I grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was the liaison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the word?
[SPEAKER_02]: The representative, if you will,
for me and for the industry here,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the community here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why, without Mike, this industry
here wouldn't be what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I'm not just tooting his horn.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good to hear because it was a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see where we are now because of
that work is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was fun researching the show and
looking at some of the numbers where we
[SPEAKER_00]: started and where we are now is just,
it's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went from a small, we just,
we are good examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I don't like to, we're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way I can say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to kind of not be as financially
okay as we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to just straight not be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody else in what, 20,
2010, 2011, 2012, how many different
[SPEAKER_00]: economic crashes that we go through in
that short of a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cars used to suck and break down all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I had that white van that the doors
didn't lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd come open when he'd turn,
it would run out of gas because the gas
[SPEAKER_02]: gauge didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to walk some times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The engine was just die and make me shit
my pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ran out of gas, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't you get gas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the gas gauge doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those, that used to be how our
life is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I know my car will start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built it up slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that was we carved out a
place for ourselves in the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big part of it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We helped create the legal cannabis world
to carve ourselves a piece out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't fuck anybody over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took a couple of individual fuck-ins
and a group fucking, but we didn't fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably we still have the opportunity,
but we're not going to, there's plenty of,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do business that way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's part of why I think we got
where we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we didn't fuck the people that
needed it or that could have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just took it in stride and laughed and
walked away and told other people I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't fuck with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they, they bent us over pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, Mike, let's focus in a little bit
because, uh, we did go from, we,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were not doing financially well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember your house on eighth
street, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a minute where we were living
with in-laws and there were like five
[SPEAKER_00]: adults in this tiny little three room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spot for a minute while we got everybody
back on their feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that was back before there was a
legal cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was back when I was walking to
city council meetings, cause I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a car because we were a one car household
and my wife had a better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she got the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I walked cause it was,
I wasn't getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to city council because
somebody needed to go to city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I could, I, uh, I talk about it
sometimes on Patreon and other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you went and spoke about cannabis,
uh, you had to have nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you were risking kind of everything
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that started to change when I
was going, I was risking a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wasn't risking like what Cheech and
Chong were risking being them back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, after a while, it's sort of like
a little protective thing formed because
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the police knew me and they knew
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew that I was active in city
council and that if they came and tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: raid my house or something that would make
the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that everything would have to be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just never bothered to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I never gave them a reason to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to be very, very careful,
but because I was careful and because
[SPEAKER_00]: everything worked the way it did this
whole city is different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of what the episodes about
is where the city started and where it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's completely good segue brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you like the segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're called to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was quiet and patient letting you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we were called Pueblo is called this
steel city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have a steel mill here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what forged our city.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago, we had the opportunity to
either get, uh, the university or the
[SPEAKER_02]: steel mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of a university, we chose a
steel mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, that is kind of the mentality
that has been here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to the people that forged our
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists because of you, but,
uh, it was very, it was like 60 some
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand jobs at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I moved to Pueblo,
it was like 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, I mean, the city was hurting bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was dusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nowhere to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's still a little funky,
but it's getting a lot better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it used to be just all labor jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were our age, well, not our age
now, but if you were in the mid twenties,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, you were doing construction or fast
food or crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people legit straight up here
were doing petty crimes, just enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: get away, just to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not enough law enforcement
here to make that, uh, dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do that here and make a small
living doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't come here and try to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how you used to live here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, all those people that were living by
petty crime, restaurants, struggling,
[SPEAKER_02]: unemployment, uh, just doing whatever it
kind of hustles.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them got legit jobs in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were illegal growers,
illegal dealers, illegal whatevers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they are actually in the legal
industry, paying taxes with a badge,
[SPEAKER_02]: being contributing members to society,
not having to hire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being in fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, now that's one less person for law
enforcement to look out for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've come a long way and we've got
restaurants here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching the city transform has been fun,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, the whole place used to shut down
at like seven 30 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to drive me batty because I'm from
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up, grew up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my early twenties and mid twenties
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a variety of delicious food at
two in the morning and to move to Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: and have that not be an option sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel where after seven 30 at night is
jack in the box or something you cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And slowly but surely over the years,
Pueblo has gotten like 5% better a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got stuff I'd never thought I'd
see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm, I've got, uh, special diet needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm, I'm, I try to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now there are restaurants I can eat
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of times it'd be like,
you can get a burger, but now I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to eat a burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of grilled cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plenty of marvelous,
wonderful vegetarian restaurants around
[SPEAKER_02]: here where I can walk in and are not
specifically vegetarian, but places that
[SPEAKER_02]: offer specifically vegetarian menus and
items and meals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got the V on it or the little
vegetable next to it to let me know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey bro, you can eat this here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few years ago, that wasn't an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get Mexican food or a burger
and, or a burger with green chili on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also an option here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I, I mean, even our mall is dying
slower than the rest of them because,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, legal cannabis, our city council and
our less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but the county commissioners saw
the opening that that, that would give
[SPEAKER_00]: economically and they dove on it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we're still, I think it was fifth
or sixth largest producing County in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, um, tax revenue wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pueblo is doing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now because of this and people do
like to talk a lot of trash about us,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that we are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting weird reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are parts of their parts of
town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not wear my watch too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's parts of that part of town,
every time where you don't wear the drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the watch off and you hide the
sneakers and you just don't get out the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking car.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, there's that part in every
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you gotta be careful where you
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's getting better and we're
getting a lot more stores speaking of the
[SPEAKER_02]: drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there, there's a sneaker shop here
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're like, just a really good
sneaker shop in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is like high-end hoodies and
high-end sneakers and like fashion stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: like luxury fashion items that are not
super affordable for the average shopper.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since we've got a nice thriving
economy here, a lot of the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: shop there honestly are in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognize them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see each other when we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what's up bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You run that run grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, we all smell like dank when we go
in there like, and that's because of this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, we wouldn't have no drip to drip
if we weren't working at the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the impact it had in Pueblo,
we've got one of the higher unemployment
[SPEAKER_00]: rates in town and this sort of what Jeff
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it added jobs at exactly the right
moment and it added, um, building
[SPEAKER_00]: investment and real estate investment and
adjust the right moments and really
[SPEAKER_00]: revitalize the whole County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like a lot of winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't change everything overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our streets aren't paved in gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them still have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're full of potholes, but little
things got better and it gets a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better every year because the whole
industry gets a little bit bigger every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the first year we paved a couple
of sidewalks near some middle schools and
[SPEAKER_00]: bought some golf carts for a golf course
that a lot of senior citizens in this area
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was sort of like a senior citizen
tax funded thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't real happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were spending money on golf cards,
but whatever it's an old grudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, three years later,
we're not doing sidewalks in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a gymnasium on a school and
then $5,000 in scholarships becomes 15 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's at like 2 million a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 2 million and 2 million a year in
scholarships going into Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can apply if they meet some really
basic criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it doesn't sound like a ton of
money per student, but like $2,500 a year
[SPEAKER_00]: can be the difference between going and
not going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can pay for your books, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that it is for a lot of
people, especially because the
[SPEAKER_00]: universities down here in Pueblo don't
charge what some of the major universities
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere do, but they give you a good
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lets a lot of kids locally go to
college that might not otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's opportunity that wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know that we're putting
that much money back into education here
[SPEAKER_02]: through cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from a local tax initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not some of the state taxes that
we'll talk about a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just from a local county tax that
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all goes into one education fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone we know from the cannabis industry
that used to work at the retail level now
[SPEAKER_00]: works in that education fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just provided that employment stepping
stone and that little bit of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: lifeblood that our city needed to get back
on its feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of our people here were unemployed
and lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they've all got really cool jobs
because of this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met so many cool people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next thing on my list is the
people, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of the people has changed here
in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a more enlightened,
more open-minded, maybe a younger sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I moved here, the biggest issue that
the city council was talking about was how
[SPEAKER_00]: do we get not senior citizens to move
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was sort of a retirement
community because we just didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of jobs for your average like 20 to 50
year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of call centers and a
couple of other small time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 job, 100 job production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mill had like five or 6,000
employees and that was sort of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And little by little, this industry slowly
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we watched it back in the medical
only days before the rec wave of funding
[SPEAKER_00]: and money really hit all of the grow
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, there was two hydroponic shops in
town and they both sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they both got a lot better
because there was a lot more money going
[SPEAKER_00]: through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's like 15, there's three or
four on each side and they all suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but most of them are thriving because
growing at home, a couple of plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that a lot of people do and they
all need all the supplies for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just the different ways that
legalization is the impact of the city are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer you think about it,
the more impacts you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the rec wave hit,
it was 50% of our construction funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on my list.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things on my list is
construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 52 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I know these because in 2015,
the anti-pop people tried to throw the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry out of town and I had a lot of
other people do the data digging for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just remember the numbers from then,
but, uh, uh, we had 1300 employees back
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's about 25,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, um, there's 30 or 40 different
businesses down here that employed
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of people across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 40,000 employees across the
state, 40,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you exact numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the pandemic, we had 40,267
individuals licensed to work in legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have an employment badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know exactly how many of those are
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 1686 businesses currently,
uh, two years into it, we've got 41,783.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so a thousand, 1500 more badged people
and 1887 businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 200 businesses opened during the
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things weren't as bad as we might've
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I get, I wouldn't call it recession
proof, but it's recession proof,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like all the other mild vices.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're stuck at home and can't see
people, what you'd smoke some weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: hang out on zoom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales have gone up every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado has had the industry,
not substantially, but they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're curious, it works out to
about 355 bucks per person in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to do the math and gave up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the way you can do the math,
um, is you just take the yearly sales and
[SPEAKER_00]: divide it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divide it by 5755 or 5,759,000 people in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I fucked this math up
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody out there will correct you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember right, I might've done the
total tax haul divided by the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be $355 per person in the States
so far after like seven years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a weird way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a helpful number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't get dabbed while you
do your research folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you didn't have a lot of time to
prepare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad that you're that you made it
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Mike for making it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was some scrambling today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go fast because we're
already, I wrote down here, Mike,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you see me making check marks,
this is 30, 45 and 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how many minutes we've been going
just to politely let you know where we
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you've covered this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say, uh, there are a lot
of cool ancillary businesses that did open
[SPEAKER_02]: head shops, restaurants, sneaker shops,
clothing places.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mall is staying alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you said effect is intense
because like there's the, the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transport people, the retail outlets,
and then there's the hash makers of the
[SPEAKER_00]: processors, the edible companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people need packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people need labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people need light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people need plumbers and
electricians and backers and lawyers,
[SPEAKER_02]: business executives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people need lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, all of those people need
tires on their cars, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about, so there's a small subdivision,
uh, west of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, it's called Pueblo West out
there in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, there are a lot of grows and a
several dispensaries out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there was nothing to eat out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few, there's like a Thai
restaurant and some other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Thai food place and a Wendy's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, unless you've got all day,
then you can go to Sonic, but that who
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to not eating Sonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, eventually a bunch of food trucks
popped up out there and from like 11 to
[SPEAKER_02]: about two o'clock, it looked like a food
truck fare and they were, uh, banking
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you'd see the whole trim crew out
there just lined up and they'd all be,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'd come back and hold their gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be like, bro, that barbecue place is fired
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to the chicken wing place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next day we're having falafel and
like those barbecue trucks and food trucks
[SPEAKER_02]: were killing it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a whole nother business just
because of the business that was out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's been fun watching it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it started, there was,
the whole area was just empty warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's all thriving businesses with,
um, five, 10, 15 employees each.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those people need lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the security guards, the gas stations
are busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to go at lunch and get like something
from the gas station and you got to wait
[SPEAKER_02]: in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the trim crews out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic out in that area is nuts and
it used to be empty because there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only traffic was at night with
people coming back into town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's swamp all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's just a ton of people out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the average age of the people
working in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wondered if you had that because I
would assume it's mostly like 24 to like
[SPEAKER_02]: 35.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to have a few,
you know, there's going to be some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some outliers, but then you're going to
have like management and stuff is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be your like 40 to 50 year olds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of researchable information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we did right from the
get-go was trying to collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can go on the Colorado
department of revenue website and just
[SPEAKER_00]: Google is your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ask Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google questions you want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll, it, it was real easy to find
the number of people that have badges,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of business licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look up who got fined last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make that real easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look up taxes by County.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've even got a real, a tab that makes
graphs for you and you can do pie charts
[SPEAKER_00]: or bar charts and look at tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I know that Pueblo was like the
sixth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have time to sit there and add up
all the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you asked me if I could figure out
the percentage of marijuana grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado that comes from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technically I know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know where to get the info,
but it's hours and hours and hours with
[SPEAKER_00]: the work until I find a way to make it
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure smarter people already know
that way, but with the data that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available to me, I would have had to go
for two January 1st, 2014 and just write
[SPEAKER_00]: down how much Pueblo paid in taxes and hit
plus, and go forward a month at a time to
[SPEAKER_00]: present day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the totals are there, but it's easy
to find somebody, somebody get on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: start typing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what percentage of the
legal cannabis produced in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_02]: produced in Pueblo if it's recreational or
medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a hundred percent of cannabis
produced in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: What percentage is made here in Pueblo
County, a city or County recreational or
[SPEAKER_02]: medical one of my data number guys.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's broken down by County and no
one outside of Pueblo County understands
[SPEAKER_00]: that the city of Pueblo and the city,
the County of Pueblo are different
[SPEAKER_00]: entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to explain that to city government
and they got kind of pissy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this, you can figure it out by County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only 160,000 people down here in the
state of Colorado is 5.75 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 160,000 60,000 is not that many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our city's not that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were the fifth, fourth,
fifth or sixth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the fifth largest producer in
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're supplying all kinds of area
around town, around the state that either
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grow their own or can't grow enough
of their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says, go down to Pueblo and get
some herbs down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a whole commercial market knows
you're going to stop down here and get
[SPEAKER_02]: some pounds for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the commercial market,
you guys don't think you're just driving
[SPEAKER_02]: here to get pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, that's not, we might still be
the only County in Pueblo where it's legal
[SPEAKER_00]: for a business to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know that was true for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been super on top of other
counties, law changes for the last little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody might've squeaked that one in
there, but I think we're still the only
[SPEAKER_00]: County where that's legal in Colorado,
which is sort of insane when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other counties are dumb and Pueblo
week reaps the windfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, unfortunately for a while,
uh, anti pot people in the powers that be
[SPEAKER_00]: have a moratorium on new businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sort of capped at where we are
right now, but, um, for a long time it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a boom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have legal pot in your
area, by all means use this podcast to
[SPEAKER_00]: help argue for legal pot in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay off a lot of the debts in your town,
fix the roads, fund some schools,
[SPEAKER_02]: get some kids, some scholarships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the moratorium here doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there is plenty of cannabis available,
plenty of cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for now it, uh, when it goes legal
nationally, it, it'll hurt us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be helping, but, uh, the rest of
the planet needs our herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we need to expand enough to
provide that grove enough for the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or just get everybody out there at
home to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys exercise your legal rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you to break the law,
but you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are in a legal place where it
is legal, legal and safe for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce any amount of cannabis,
grow your legal fucking limits,
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they see you can have six plants,
gross, six Volkswagen buses, it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow on big, grow them loud, proud,
grow them strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's illegal where you are,
I legally can't tell you to break the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also can't tell you Mike, Michael,
Mike, he's calling white Mike for a
[SPEAKER_02]: reason, but here I am saying you're a
fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your mouth shut and do what the fuck
you think is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also have a lawyer on retainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, girlfriends and homies ruin,
ruin grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have definitely talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anybody, keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the electrician doesn't need to see
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tip the delivery driver,
the Uber driver, the grub hub dude with
[SPEAKER_02]: don't tip people with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to know where that you got
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they know you got it, but they don't
need to know that you got enough to gift
[SPEAKER_02]: at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to wonder where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to come back to your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may show up when you're not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that episode just took a turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, bro, we provide a lot of ganja here in
the seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have worked with a lot of grow
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I was working in grow
facilities, I purposely never did the math
[SPEAKER_00]: in my head, but since I don't anymore,
I went back and did the math in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just chuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, especially when I do the math and I
pretend like it's the year 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, when it was 400 an ounce was just the
friend price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, letting you know, letting you shop
here was, was the friend discount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've made businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rivers, literally of money, rivers and
rivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got paid small streams of analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get the city to finally allow
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept telling them there's a river of
money flowing right around the city
[SPEAKER_00]: because the county was dove in with both
fees when this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple tiptoed in back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to drive either 15 that way or 15
that way to get out of city limits,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to go buy medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, we bro, we put one right in
the middle of the fucking city.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Tom and Karen for
trusting us and having faith in us to run
[SPEAKER_02]: that business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one day I told Tom, I forget the words
that I used.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically told him, he didn't really
know how to run a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I said it more politely than that
because I did respect him and he reached
[SPEAKER_02]: across the counter and he gave me keys and
he said, do it then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh shit, I've been talking
shit and now it's time to shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I shown like some stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, big shout out to Tom and Karen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been, we have, we've been a good
team since then, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for 37 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything that you'd like to
add to the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, we've gone through most
of the notes that I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to backtrack on the
things I've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, just, uh, not to put a damper on
it, but to put some perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Colorado state's total budget is like
30 to 40 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far to date, our total cannabis tax
call just broke 2 billion, which is a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $2 billion with the awesome stuff
we couldn't have done before that we got
[SPEAKER_00]: to do now because of this, but it's like
half a percent or 1% maybe of a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: a state's yearly budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, it's not, it's really not a lot
of ticket, but it's a hundred percent a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our city, a hundred percent,
it saved us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't even imagine what Pueblo
would be like now if this wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it got us national press.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought in, uh, a lot of people moved
here that were like in their twenties and
[SPEAKER_00]: thirties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the boom for the construction industry
was hit so hard back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that this really revitalized
Pueblo has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting to see it all firsthand has
been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read those homegrown meetings were
really, really, really, really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you're still listening,
fun story, uh, this is the best part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, these are the gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a, I'm in a city meeting that I
was, I was randomly approached after a
[SPEAKER_00]: city council meeting to attend a meeting
about a specific rule and other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, officially were invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know how to make the rule and
how to craft it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I show up to this meeting and I'm
early and excited, um, cause I'm being
[SPEAKER_00]: included finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not kicking and screaming at a
wall is what it felt like for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start talking and the two people
sitting next to me are narcotics
[SPEAKER_00]: detectives who are talking about shooting
a video that I a hundred percent appear in
[SPEAKER_00]: at least a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have the biggest smile on my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, one of them goes,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, I used to go up and down those
stairs a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just both didn't have any idea
what to say to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of looked at each other and
looked at me and looked back at each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just started laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was a lot of fun cause at the
end of that meeting, they took my
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestion and my suggestion is still the
rule for the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I win story time with Mike and
he won in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good victory for Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, man, those stairs, I remember,
I know the stairs you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there was a lot of, uh, loading of
plants, uh, loading of product in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what kind of footage they got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see that footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, uh, there was apparently a
camera watching the back stairs for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last several weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we paid them a lot of tax money and
then they decided to come in and shut us
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mike and I, we had some friends that
were founding a dispensary and they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: quite know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had, they had a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed some young blood in there and
I was young and eager and I went in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, let's do this and this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got them going as a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hired Mike in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we took that place the fuck
off, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: A moment ago, you were talking about,
uh, people that came here for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to give a shout out to,
uh, I'm not going to say names.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met and made so many friends that we
would have never met.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I do so many, like we met because
of a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're crazy father in law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to you crazy fucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he brought Mike in there to make
friends with me and we, we fucking hit it
[SPEAKER_02]: off, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We became great friends immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that we've got plenty of friends that
we don't even need to run the gamut of
[SPEAKER_02]: friends cause somebody will feel left out,
but we made so many friends, guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: girls, different ages, sexes, genders,
locations that are all here that we made
[SPEAKER_02]: friends with, uh, through the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm grateful for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we don't talk, it has been a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're still here, if you've moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being part of the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up if you miss me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the same dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if, uh, even if things got weird or
whatever, um, shout out, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: Pandy is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you lived through it, I forgive you.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live through the pandemic,
we ain't got no beef no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're survivors together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, bro, I'm through my notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it when we ramble, but that,
uh, really like it when we ramble,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've, we're limited by our battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Card time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure we could still go technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, bro, great podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great having you back on studios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we got four walls to three walls to
choose from for backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way to this from your iPhone with
a little headphone mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you're noticing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode seven one nine in the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike will be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, now that he knows that there's a
mic over there waiting for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know, I know, I know that we can record
group shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mike will be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so much better than zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm frustrated recording zoom shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole like, Hey bro, what are we going
to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's my turn to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I, if you, if I sound half as good
in your headphones as I do in mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the listeners no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can finally hear me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't jinx us, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked so hard to be audible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once again, zoom has, uh,
bent us over occasionally cave does not
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're invited back bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime that you can get off the leash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you can, uh, I asked him,
I asked Mike if it was morally wrong or
[SPEAKER_02]: legally wrong to kennel the children and
he didn't seem to find that appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike's a good person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day they get older, getting away
from them gets a little easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got kids, you understand that
sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, for a minute it was tough for
a couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, part of it is just the routine doesn't
let up and finding gaps is, is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: easier right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully there's a lot more of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This studio is too awesome to stay away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really blown away, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep saying studio, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll forget that it's my dining room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a studio.

years.
