[SPEAKER_05]: out something super duper freaking
important What was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't even mention live resin
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Only reason we probably didn't talk
about is because it's nothing new to us
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it was like the thing for 2014
We talked to people today that were like I
[SPEAKER_05]: still haven't seen any live resin and then
just Joe blow like pulls them out of his
[SPEAKER_05]: pocket like yo I got some right here,
you know, and it's just like the guys just
[SPEAKER_05]: like oh He's one, you know to enter some
shit to a competition and it's like You
[SPEAKER_04]: just won.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No live resin is definitely a big pick up
on something new Especially with you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the addition of closed loop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of really came about Shout-out to
emo tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout-out to giddy emo tech kind bill that
whole crew that kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: put the put the forward push Yeah live
resin did a lot for you.

[SPEAKER_05]: It did a lot for emo and giddy I did a lot
for hanky B in the greener side kind of as
[SPEAKER_05]: a residual it actually Your win in the
secret cup boosted up my Instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: following it made me more known So yeah
live resin kind of boosted us all up in
[SPEAKER_05]: the in the scene a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah for sure I mean, I can't believe we
forgot about live on the year review
[SPEAKER_05]: episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was big Yeah, huge Maddie's
shaking her head all flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe we did either This was
such a big part of the end of our year,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with the secret cup So and it
was awesome to win the secret cup
[SPEAKER_01]: regionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met a lot of people in Denver through
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah in people's Still talk to me like I'm
part of your crew like you grew that well,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm like, I didn't grow it,
dude That's they grow it they fucking pop
[SPEAKER_05]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They shatter it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They blasted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all them So I have to correct people
and I let them know that you grew that I
[SPEAKER_05]: never take credit for your guys's grow I
didn't grow that stuff you guys it was
[SPEAKER_05]: them soil to oil Yeah, actually the stuff
for I may have grown a couple of theirs,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I've taken credit for those So this is
kind of a random note a lady messaged me
[SPEAKER_05]: on Instagram and kind of called me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said that and I'm sure I said this but
I don't remember the exact words in an
[SPEAKER_05]: older episode I kind of tried to cover my
ass legally with the disclaimer like if
[SPEAKER_05]: you live in an illegal state Don't grow
weed follow the rules and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say that kind of shit to cover my
ass I don't know technically if I come on
[SPEAKER_05]: the air and I say hey if you live in
Florida fuck all the rules grow all the
[SPEAKER_05]: weed you can I don't know if I'm gonna get
in trouble for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to cover my own ass I just say follow
the follow the rules you guys but I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that you should grow your own cannabis if
you're smoking cannabis if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: consuming cannabis if you Like it
recreationally if you like it medically
[SPEAKER_05]: grow the Fuck out of it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my new stance on it overgrow the
government.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't arrest us all They might arrest
me for saying that but if they do somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: else make a badass podcast and keeps going
for me And I mean if you are gonna do it
[SPEAKER_05]: Illegally, you know if you do it somewhat
responsibly and you're willing to go to
[SPEAKER_05]: court for that then so be it I mean you
may be the change that your state or your
[SPEAKER_05]: Community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah your community is needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So plant more seeds you guys grow more
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't be a hypocrite I grow a lot of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should too, but also Know the
risks if you've got kids in the house,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can lose the kids They're gonna shoot
your dog most likely when they come in the
[SPEAKER_05]: door think about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be traumatizing It's gonna fuck
up your life If you're prepared for that
[SPEAKER_05]: if you can handle that if you were a man
and or woman enough if you're transgender
[SPEAKER_05]: enough I'm not trying to exclude anybody
I'm trying to include all of you if you
[SPEAKER_05]: are a person enough and you can handle
that shit grow cannabis Do your thing just
[SPEAKER_05]: know what the risks are.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man Thanks for coming on and you keep
us updated with our local politics and the
[SPEAKER_05]: local shit that we need to be aware of and
I think that reminding us about our local
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff teaches our listeners that they can
participate too and it gets them off the
[SPEAKER_05]: couch Which is what we need you can be an
activist in so many ways Be ready to do
[SPEAKER_06]: local political work If marijuana is
getting legalized in your state as soon as
[SPEAKER_06]: it's legal at the state level all sorts of
nightmarish work begins at the local level
[SPEAKER_06]: with the city and county level and If you
don't have somebody in your crew ready to
[SPEAKER_06]: step up on that It's not gonna go the way
you want it to and you're looking at local
[SPEAKER_06]: bands like Colorado Springs.

become with some city council members will
[SPEAKER_05]: be hanging out taking dabs in the phone
will ring and he'd be like Oh,

[SPEAKER_05]: listening to reggae and you're gonna
excuse yourself to go talk to the city
[SPEAKER_06]: council manager Okay, they they're people
too bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you call them, they call you back
Their job is to keep the constituents
[SPEAKER_06]: happy and it doesn't matter how often you
dab your constituent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty killer I like that you've
developed that relationship for us because
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not my spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's fully my I can see why it's like
my wheelhouse and honestly, I don't see
[SPEAKER_06]: myself knowing what you know about growing
or knowing what Spence knows about blast
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's just I know about zoning Me doing
your job speaking of zoning both of you
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at me going thank fucking god

[SPEAKER_05]: been Maddie and I got to give out live res
dabs to everybody all night.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of fun Full-on dad bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't have a mic, but most of you

[SPEAKER_02]: the room I had someone ask me to plan
their reception form You just Show up with
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah shit ton of beer So Maddie just

our crew from NC in Colorado They have
[SPEAKER_01]: really stepped up their game this year and
all learned how to grow some killer weed
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted they have some you know,
good friends to help them learn But our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends really stepped up and started
growing some amazing cannabis this year
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve a big shout out for that good
genetics go a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot I was kind of gonna brag
on that Yeah, shout out to all those guys
[SPEAKER_05]: cuz a lot of them you guys have passed on
I read genetic seeds to a lot of that crew
[SPEAKER_05]: and they are freaking killing it on
Instagram So you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to suggest irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place to get reliable
reliable genetics from Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wish I could give unfortunately
you guys there aren't any seeds in the
[SPEAKER_05]: prize packages because of legal reasons
these prizes are available to almost
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody in the United States unless you're
here at the table or you're too closely
[SPEAKER_05]: affiliated with the show by the way,
I make the fucking rules and they can
[SPEAKER_06]: change any time I decide they're mad
jealous Yeah prize packs are sick guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember where I was headed
Yeah, anyway, anybody can get the prizes
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so they can't be seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: There can't be seeds in there I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll will make a Colorado local contest
where I can put some irie seeds in there
[SPEAKER_05]: eventually I just got to figure out how to
do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just be a local thing So yeah big
shout out to all those guys dude Maddie
[SPEAKER_05]: you sound great on a microphone You were
you need to be podcasting all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I have a we have a discussion table
every night when we take dabs We usually
[SPEAKER_01]: just have a session sit down and talk for
an hour or two And just bullshit and
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly it could be on a podcast So
that's why I've said it before on the show
[SPEAKER_05]: that your table is part of what inspired
this podcast Your guys's friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't say his name He used to come and
pick my brain for two hours at a time at
[SPEAKER_05]: your table And then I thought I should
record all this or write it down and just
[SPEAKER_01]: refer him to my recordings I wish I could
just bring thoughts back that I have like
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember something we were talking about
but I don't remember the specifics once
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on an older podcast that I used to do
shout out to 719 the blocks On that
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast we had a recording issue and our
whole recording got lost and we decided
[SPEAKER_05]: let's just try to redo it and mimic it in
about 10 minutes in we're like this feels
[SPEAKER_05]: so fake there's no way to bring back those
thoughts in that conversation so we just
[SPEAKER_05]: gave up we're like no so Remaking a talk
isn't it's not the most legit thing We've
[SPEAKER_05]: sat here and tried to make a podcast four
or five times in one night, and it just
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't work Yeah, that was about episode
13 or 15 ish around that area was
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's better when it's not forced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I just I wasn't feeling it like it
was time to record and I just wasn't in
[SPEAKER_05]: the mood And now I'm I'm way more
comfortable at it So get 50 episodes in on
[SPEAKER_05]: this show and then I did about 50 with
another show also So I've had some time to
[SPEAKER_05]: get comfortable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've only been a host for 50
episodes I feel like I've only been a host
[SPEAKER_05]: for about 30 episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me 20 25 Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking
about doing more frequent episodes because
[SPEAKER_05]: we get more listens when they're more
frequent But I don't want to bore people
[SPEAKER_05]: also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't want to be that podcast I'm
with information disappears for three
[SPEAKER_05]: months and then comes out with the show
and then comes out and Apologizes,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then I also don't want you to have to
listen to me four times a week like Joe
[SPEAKER_05]: Rogan because I don't even have time To
hear all the Joe Rogan stuff Joe Rogan's a
[SPEAKER_04]: busy, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, it's Vince just grabbed the mic
for Maddie He smacked her with it
[SPEAKER_05]: violently It's a cute violence when they
do it, how about you Spence you got any
[SPEAKER_05]: shoutouts for the year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see Shoutouts all the people who
breed seeds and give me free seats to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that And the people that took
me up with Legit genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's I've had genetics from California
Seattle So shout out to all the people out
[SPEAKER_04]: there that have passed on genetics,
you know, it's kind of Now it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: something that should be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is you know kind of share the genetics
for people Um, there's always gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: cuts people are gonna hold that's just how
it works, but you could still share at the
[SPEAKER_05]: same time Sharing is My carb cap was
clogged so I was fucking choking on it to
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean that out a little bit sharing is
good here in Colorado Gotta keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, try not to be a clone hoarder And I
know that's hypocritical because I'm a
[SPEAKER_05]: breeder and I'm kind of a clone hoarder
Everybody's gonna keep your special
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics But everybody's got those couple
that if you got something that's high in
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD or is really good medicine It's
medicine share.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well cuts are one thing seeds are another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah seeds are available Like I think
seeds should be getting out get given out
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of why you guys are frustrated
with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot of stuff at naturesgreen
remedies.com It's because all my locals
[SPEAKER_05]: are getting it There is obviously a markup
When you go through a dealer a distributor
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm skipping that markup and getting
the seeds to my locals at wholesale prices
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it feels good doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry that you guys didn't get a lot on
nature's green remedies You'll get the
[SPEAKER_05]: next the whole batch will probably go to
you because my locals are served up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's fed And I mean nine times out
of ten.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of times 90% you would say
would go to nature's green remedies and
[SPEAKER_05]: only like five percent stays here Yeah,
and then all my friends are like where the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and I'm like you have to go online
like everyone else and it feels rude It
[SPEAKER_05]: was kind of our Christmas this year.

it's the web anybody can listen to it and
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody anywhere I sent print ads to
nature's green remedies and so everybody

world yeah as soon as I get the new logo

could probably tell you by looking at the

where yeah I could see where everybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: IP address is but the problem is if people
cheat on their IP addresses because they

rules they probably listen to number 50

shows me how far you drop out and people
[SPEAKER_05]: just get tired of me rambling by myself
but tell your friends about the show if
[SPEAKER_05]: all 5,000 of my listeners told one per
told two people about the show because one

Mike and Jesse are pretty damn close to
[SPEAKER_06]: each other just to make room for I don't
have any more microphones the third time I
[SPEAKER_02]: hit him in the face with the ball was
totally an accident it was it was clearly
[SPEAKER_06]: an accident and it was clearly the straw
that but I think taking out of that job
[SPEAKER_06]: site it as fast as you can with all wheels
spinning towards that very very thin and
[SPEAKER_06]: steel-framed gate is just gonna be
something we all do at least twice sounds
[SPEAKER_05]: like you guys have fun at work we do zero
fun is allowed at work looks like you're
[SPEAKER_06]: breaking rules when a bunch of males of
the same age are left to just stand around
[SPEAKER_06]: for sounds like a National Geographic
description yeah bizarre shit happens that
[SPEAKER_05]: dad just made my face kind of today it was
t-ball that do weird shit injuries and

couple times but I can't even who you yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: they make fun of you at work this way it's
fun here Jesus comes like these guys

think it's partly my fault that these guys
[SPEAKER_05]: all kind of built a construction company
together on accident and it's fun to see
[SPEAKER_05]: all my bros just hanging out talking about
what they did because before they were all
[SPEAKER_05]: off doing their own separate shit and they
all have a good story together so Adam
[SPEAKER_05]: said that 2015 is the year of learning
does anybody else have something that 2015
[SPEAKER_02]: is for them the year of what I was
thinking the 2014 is the year like getting
[SPEAKER_06]: the construction and the foundation in
2015 is actually seeing some shit succeed
[SPEAKER_05]: and get finished sounds nice I finally got
hired on at a large facility so I've got

support the movement here and be part of
[SPEAKER_05]: this scene here how many times have we
defended it in Denver you know yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we beat the shit out of the
people that we're talking shit about
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking stabbed him with switchblades took
all their money and their Nikes just
[SPEAKER_05]: kidding probably one of the least violent
people I know all right we've gone almost
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 minutes we should put about another 10
minutes into this show anybody got
[SPEAKER_05]: anything smart ass or great to say what
are some of your favorite moments we've
[SPEAKER_05]: had on this podcast so far I know remember
that night we say here we talked about it
[SPEAKER_05]: earlier we sat here you sat across the
table from me and we tried to do a show
[SPEAKER_05]: for like three hours and I don't know if
it was the dabs or if it was just the the
[SPEAKER_05]: unfocusedness of the group but yeah you
know like in the middle of the podcast he
[SPEAKER_05]: just walks up in the room starts yelling
and screaming and it was weird so it
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't really happen but it kind of really
did happen kind of happened but that was
[SPEAKER_05]: that was definitely a funny moment that
was funny I had a recording error to our I
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't delete one of the pre-recorded
tracks from another recording session and
[SPEAKER_05]: when he came around to that that recording
dropped into while we were talking it was
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect it was perfect it was like because
the guy goes hey it's me man what's going
[SPEAKER_05]: on and just starts talking but you're not
even in the room how the hell did you just
[SPEAKER_05]: do that Jeff was a ventriloquist at that
point in time and I was like wow this is
[SPEAKER_05]: really weird yeah 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I need to go home man that's like
some four-track shit yeah a moment that I
[SPEAKER_05]: really really remember is when I ate the
350 milligram edible on the podcast I
[SPEAKER_05]: remember I don't remember the whole hour
show but I can't remember doing it I sat
[SPEAKER_05]: here holding on to my chair just tapping
my feet as hard as I could yeah whoa I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: flying right now those things those things
you do not want to come to Colorado and
[SPEAKER_05]: eat okay brownie but that's 350 milligrams
of sit the fuck down read the damn label
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing yeah if you guys come to
Colorado and eat edibles be careful please
[SPEAKER_05]: luckily that's a medical only but you know
yeah I think they can only sell 100 gram
[SPEAKER_05]: edibles at the rec site now that's a rule
what Incredibles are yeah they're so I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean yeah yeah buy like 70 yeah like it's
read the fucking label like that's what
[SPEAKER_06]: that was the big lesson of 2014 is why
happens if you legalize weed oh as it
[SPEAKER_06]: turns out people don't read labels for
fucking anything ever we just assume
[SPEAKER_06]: people that don't even take pot like they
don't even think about it do y'all
[SPEAKER_06]: remember the chips that gave you anal
leakage like they were looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: fat-free and it made your asshole drip a
front of the bag and they still sold
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere and it's because people don't
read labels and with edibles that leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: you to hugging a pair of weird jeans in a
hotel room and then writing about it for
[SPEAKER_06]: the New York Times you know they may try
not to shit himself on you know the meme
[SPEAKER_05]: with the little black kid that always says
you mean to tell me that blah blah blah
[SPEAKER_05]: and blah blah blah yeah but you mean to
tell me there was some fucking chips that
[SPEAKER_05]: caused anal leakage and people were still
buying it yeah I forgot that y'all were
[SPEAKER_06]: probably on two fish tour when this hit
the shelves because it's those timelines
[SPEAKER_06]: line up but you know Lester I think was
the special oil they found a special oil
[SPEAKER_06]: and you could eat chips that you didn't
get any calories from the fact was your
[SPEAKER_06]: butt was leaking yeah all that fat your
body didn't absorb was dripping out your
[SPEAKER_06]: ass so no pass I will pass America was all
about it I don't need a snack I have to
[SPEAKER_06]: eat on the toilet see Jesse's a fellow to
eat anything at the gas station kid you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what the fuck's up no I remember
making fun of my cousin for eating those
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah never reading the package I'm like
[SPEAKER_06]: chips and they still sold all over the
country this is definitely a record time
[SPEAKER_06]: for the word anal beings people just don't
even see it they think 350 milligrams huh
[SPEAKER_06]: that seems like a lot for a fun-sized
Snickers edible they chew that shit back
[SPEAKER_06]: in 20 minutes later they think they're in
space they're really just sit in the hot
[SPEAKER_06]: tub of their hotel room just plus splash
in three inches of water 35 to 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't enough time seriously give it two or
three hours yeah give it some time to kick
[SPEAKER_06]: it it's got to be broken down and
processed in your blood and it takes a
[SPEAKER_06]: while bad Ralphie bad Ralphie every person
is different hey Spencer you gonna enter
[SPEAKER_04]: any contest in 2015 um hopefully I'd like
to I'd like to travel to Oregon and
[SPEAKER_04]: Seattle again this year and go interrupt
there maybe California but like high times
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cups or hopefully cannabis cups
cup maybe what next when is that next
[SPEAKER_04]: November again so yeah yeah maybe maybe
some I'd like to get out and kind of the
[SPEAKER_04]: best thing about going to cups is it's
like vacation but there's weed yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have to like worry about trying
to find weed because they're going to a
[SPEAKER_04]: weed event so it's there you guys got your
Denver cannabis cup tickets yet don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're doing yet so I don't know if I
want to buy tickets or go through the
[SPEAKER_05]: vending route oh yeah okay I got my
three-day pass I'm just working on booking
[SPEAKER_05]: a hotel room I've actually got a ticket to
see Doug Benson on for house at nine o
[SPEAKER_05]: 'clock it's just me I just roll solo and
just do the backpack thing it's so much
[SPEAKER_05]: easier get in the car and leave one I want
go where I want just gonna be me doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: backpack in the car yeah yeah as soon as I
get extra money I've gone with the crew of
[SPEAKER_05]: people and I've gone by myself and it's
easier for me just go and I like going I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know I like going with the crew but
I like to especially me when I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: like talk to people it's kind of it's kind
of hard having you guys will get 15 people
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're trying to all good yeah tired
of hanging out with me at the cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm not even trying to be
egotistical but people walk up and want to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to me they know who I am yeah so if
you're hanging out with me you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: hanging out by yourself pretty much so I
roll solo just go by myself and yeah easy
[SPEAKER_04]: you can you can do a lot of shit by
yourself yeah yeah you know I don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: to say hey Mike do you want to do this
that's like are you hungry Mike these
[SPEAKER_06]: events are so crowded and so well it's
ended they're trying to work is it I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: just trying to picture one of you walking
with like 15 I mean I'm gonna call him
[SPEAKER_06]: ducklings it's it's not intended as
insulting as that sounds I guess I saw
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to walk down the aisle like that
like you got to lose all your ducklings
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah you end up at the end of the road
going well fuck them I got business to do
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah pretty much and that's the thing for
me this year's business I'm trying to take
[SPEAKER_04]: care of business no more no more playing
games and being nice and none of that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to come out and take some cake
there you go I'll be trying to talk to
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody like hanging out with Mila and
then the people with me don't even know
[SPEAKER_05]: who Mila is you know who that was like no
I'm fucking bored like that was you should
[SPEAKER_05]: have got in on that conversation should
have said hello yeah I should have got
[SPEAKER_05]: your picture taken you should have gave
her a hug give her some oil or something
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah I pretty much learned that
quickly that when you're excited I should
[SPEAKER_05]: be excited when you take me places when
you're pumped that yeah there's something
[SPEAKER_05]: I should be paying attention to and even
if I don't understand right now it'll
[SPEAKER_06]: probably explain later with this guy even
lunch can be a mild adventure where famous
[SPEAKER_06]: people just appear yeah you just got to
accept it it's bizarre you just got to
[SPEAKER_05]: know how to put yourself in the position
and line yourself up to meet the people
[SPEAKER_05]: you want to meet without being creepy and
realize they're just fucking people too
[SPEAKER_05]: and if they open with the right lines
they're just humans too and they realize
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're not a stalker and they want to
talk to you I do I am nobody perfect and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I'm not everybody's cup of tea
but I kind of got a nice dude that it
[SPEAKER_05]: tells the truth most of time I felt giddy
when DNA genetics walked up to me and
[SPEAKER_05]: shook my hand because they recognized me
and my logo from Instagram like hey I know
[SPEAKER_05]: who you are man and they said what's up to
me and gave me props for my work that kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of put a smile on my face I got a hot nail
somebody talk while I dab I mean you got a
[SPEAKER_05]: great email set up for him from you know
and shout out for that we use that thing
[SPEAKER_05]: every day we used it right before the show

[SPEAKER_06]: that earlier than I forgot oh yeah I'm

see those guys like I saw a Nerdist Chris
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardwick at Red Rocks and was like
watching one of my friends achieve a goal

like I'm one of their buddies especially
[SPEAKER_05]: the people that interact with me on
Twitter and shit I know I'm their friends
[SPEAKER_05]: like if I met mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Omnio he lives in the UK if he showed up
he'd bring the doorbell he'd come in to
[SPEAKER_05]: take dabs and hang out dude I'd make a cup
of yerba mate and we'd chill out and he'd
[SPEAKER_05]: be my bro and just because I have a
podcast so that guy's my friend now from
[SPEAKER_05]: that Fred Garvin would probably show up

[SPEAKER_05]: growing is about growing there's simple
shit in your grow room that Mike may go
[SPEAKER_05]: why is that turned to that way if you turn
that way you'd get better airflow and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: just giving random examples there's like
physics and shit to be done in the grow
[SPEAKER_05]: room shot at Tony also sorry I skipped
that one he keeps the website going he
[SPEAKER_05]: keeps the feed going and he's one of the
when I said physics I thought of Tony yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: he knows about airflow and a lot of that
shit so because even if your friends
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't the best growers you can learn
accidentally about HVAC you can learn
[SPEAKER_05]: plumbing like all that shit comes in handy
so don't ever take anybody for granted
[SPEAKER_04]: shout out to Vaughn yeah and Scott and
Scott they'll never listen to this
[SPEAKER_06]: probably but they at least deserve the big
love I learned a drywall already this year

[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have everybody here again it's harder
to get ladies on the show there aren't as
[SPEAKER_05]: many ladies guys have more shit to talk
about because we're kind of egoists you
[SPEAKER_05]: know what I mean you hang out with a bunch
of badass dudes and I've got a squad of
[SPEAKER_05]: guys around me all that's what I'm saying
I saw that picture you posted like all
[SPEAKER_05]: these dudes protect me hell yeah we all
have your back dude that was yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely I'm standing in the back there
with a big old smile like I got her back
[SPEAKER_05]: forever that was a Merry Christmas and I
mean I know there's other growers like in
[SPEAKER_05]: the scene and Instagram and all that stuff
but you're the only one here locally
[SPEAKER_05]: that's at least known for producing killer
stuff so lady growers shit ladies that
[SPEAKER_05]: want to be on the podcast that have
something to contribute about cannabis if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's your opinion your very very few
female growers that I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: respect for but hopefully some will step
up come be on the show if you want we are
[SPEAKER_05]: in Pueblo Colorado on the south side and
all you got to do is send me an email you
[SPEAKER_05]: can call me you can Instagram you can
Facebook me it's grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_05]: hotmail.com I'm on Instagram at
iregenetics that was a big old dab Spencer
[SPEAKER_05]: just gave me a fat dab and he got up and
left it off somewhere no part of that the
[SPEAKER_05]: email is in the other room turned on so
that could be where he went there wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: any room on the table for the email
tonight with all the gear
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the terminology all right on that
note we're gonna wrap up the show I love
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys thanks for listening everybody
that came everybody that's listening
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone that download the show everyone
that contributes hey also a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: pandering I added we added Tony
technically added at the request of myself
[SPEAKER_05]: a donate button on the I read genetics
website if you go to iregenetics.com find
[SPEAKER_05]: the grow from your heart podcast tab there
is a donate
[SPEAKER_01]: button at the top if you feel like this
show you can also put it as an anonymous
[SPEAKER_05]: so you don't even need to know you know
it's just three bucks that came from
[SPEAKER_05]: nowhere something else that I may try to
do in the future it's called a money bomb
[SPEAKER_05]: is what this guy called it if you listen
to a lot of podcasts you may already know
[SPEAKER_05]: about it I don't want to tell you too much
or that radio I haven't paid too much
[SPEAKER_05]: attention to how to do it but it sounds
like a great idea to where it will give me
[SPEAKER_05]: money to give away to my listeners and
also help fund the podcast a little and
[SPEAKER_05]: like Maddie said I do put some time into
this they everybody here spent about an
[SPEAKER_05]: hour with me before we even recorded
putting this show together I was thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: while you were talking what it would cost
to get all of us in a room uh-huh say for
[SPEAKER_06]: like a two-hour consultation with the
business and it's in the thousands oh yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm expensive for that kind of thing if
you get all of us at the table being is
[SPEAKER_06]: upfront and honest as we are with the
podcast and I'm sitting there thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: about the content over the last 50
episodes and if you go back and cherry
[SPEAKER_06]: pick say like the outdoor growing episodes
or in the growing and curing and
[SPEAKER_06]: harvesting episodes that's like job
training if you pay attention to take
[SPEAKER_06]: notes you can fully have a career based on
that information if you put a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: years of practice into it and do your own
independent research that's the found it
[SPEAKER_06]: that's like a bachelor's degree in weed
yeah not even fucking around a little
[SPEAKER_04]: that's legit and Jesse's outdoor lessons
this year basically walked me through my
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor this year you know like there was
there was dry and cure episode got your
[SPEAKER_05]: weed dried and cured absolutely and then
Sean came and talked to you about organics
[SPEAKER_05]: and taught you how to not go buy bottled
nutrients anymore and I mean just
[SPEAKER_05]: yesterday I mixed up a girl Kashi you know
I'm saying like look out so here for a
[SPEAKER_05]: year mixing girl Kashi right I want to get
an extract artist on here that will teach
[SPEAKER_05]: us how to make hash but at the same time
that's risky because we can't teach you
[SPEAKER_05]: how to open blast because that's not legit
and then nobody wants to give away their
[SPEAKER_05]: clothes maybe we'll get somebody to come
teach us how to make water hash we'll get
[SPEAKER_05]: Fred Morris or somebody to come teach you
how to make water hash it's a very good
[SPEAKER_05]: idea yeah Fred Morris if you listen to the
show hit me up bro please I'd want you to
[SPEAKER_05]: come on and teach us how to make water
hash you know across the table there
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't know knows quite a bit about water
hash as well he's keeping his head down
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know you know he also knows who
Fred Morris is so he knows why I'm saying
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to call you out I'm just
saying that you know I've smoked it and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was very impressive you know and maybe I
haven't had that much bubble hash but I do
[SPEAKER_05]: all right it's just how we roll all he's
thinking about is damn Amy donuts closed
[SPEAKER_02]: what I thought they closed at seven
because seven we would have so stopped
[SPEAKER_05]: dude yeah I thought I said it's nine
they're closed no you told me the other
[SPEAKER_05]: day they closed at seven yeah yeah yeah
they closed at seven that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: saying it's they are closed I've never had
