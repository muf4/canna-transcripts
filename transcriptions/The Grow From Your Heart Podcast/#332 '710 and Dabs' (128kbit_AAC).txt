[SPEAKER_01]: dot store All right, you guys this is the
710 episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know 710 is all about dabbing But
why is 710 all about dabbing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get right into this episode and talk
about 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does 710?
[SPEAKER_01]: Represent dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you turn the number 710 upside
down it says oil and what better time to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke some oil than 710 Now you might say
who came up with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who came up with that It was our
friend task rock from highly educated big
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to task for being a part of the
oil movement since the beginning task and
[SPEAKER_01]: a few other folks were on a conference
call they were talking about the new
[SPEAKER_01]: movement what the future was and task
coined the phrase 710 on that call so big
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to task and his True for coining
the phrase 710 and starting this oil
[SPEAKER_01]: movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so now we know where 710 came
from and what 710 means Let's talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about dabs and dabbing and
actually participating in some 710
[SPEAKER_01]: activities Now I didn't write this part
down because I didn't think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it just dawned on me Some people may
not be real familiar with dabbing some
[SPEAKER_01]: people may be like what's he talking about
dabs and dabbing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start from the very beginning a
dab is when you take a small portion Of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis concentrate usually some oil or
some shatter or we've moved on to
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of concentrates We're
gonna talk about those later in the
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, but you take a small very small
portion of a concentrate Just a dab just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny piece like a crumb like a big
piece of kosher salt like a small seed
[SPEAKER_01]: just a tiny piece just a dab and you put
that little dab on a dabber and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: heat another piece either a banger or a
nail or a bucket we'll talk about that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future also you heat up your piece
then you Push that dab onto the hot piece
[SPEAKER_01]: which is attached to your rig and then you
smoke through the rig and you inhale That
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis concentrate you just need a
little tiny bit So that's what a dab is
[SPEAKER_01]: you smoke it just like you would smoke
anything else Except you heat the piece
[SPEAKER_01]: and then push the concentrate into it
instead of putting the concentrate into it
[SPEAKER_01]: and then applying the heat You just do it
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm talking about dabbing or
taking a dab that's all I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting a small piece of cannabis
concentrate and putting it into a nail and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it through a rig Inhale exhale
that's a dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just smoking inhale exhale That's
all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's taking a dab now The next
obvious question is what happens to me
[SPEAKER_01]: when I take that dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a dab depending on the size of the
dab and the heat of the nail Sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: nails too hot you cough a little bit from
that Sometimes it'll cause you to cough
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes people just cough from smoking a
dab expect to cough on your first dab
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna turn red.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may make a little snot You're just
gonna cough harder than you've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: coughed Before that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna laugh at you the first time
we've all done it any experienced dabber
[SPEAKER_01]: knows that you're gonna cough That's gonna
be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect that on your first dab now Here's
the part that you got to be prepared for
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on your tolerance how often you
smoke how familiar you are with being high
[SPEAKER_01]: how much you've eaten today your blood
sugar your Surroundings how big your dab
[SPEAKER_01]: is how long you hold it how hard you hit
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get pretty high off of a dab If
you take a medium-sized dab for your first
[SPEAKER_01]: dab, you're gonna go skyrocketing high
These concentrates are in the low 70s to
[SPEAKER_01]: high 80s percent I've seen them some of
the concentrates I buy are in the high 90s
[SPEAKER_01]: of THCA concentrations When you're smoking
flowers, those are in the high 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are four and five times stronger
So that one hit that you take off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint that doesn't get you high This is
like taking five hits off of a joint at
[SPEAKER_01]: one time It's almost kind of like smoking
a whole joint at one time is what it feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like sometimes Now you might say Cool,
I want to smoke a whole joint in one hit
[SPEAKER_01]: you might but it's gonna come on so
quickly that you get so high so fast that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's uncomfortable Sometimes it
makes people paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people freak out a little bit
You haven't been this high that quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: until you've smoked a dab It takes a lot
to get you there a big fat bong hit won't
[SPEAKER_01]: do it a little medium dab That'll put you
in a new place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first time you take a dab be
prepared to get super high Now the benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: to dabbing is If you're smoking for
medicinal purposes, it affects you
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately by the time you're blowing
that dab out Some of your medical ailments
[SPEAKER_01]: will be eased.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pain will be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your suffering will be limited You will
feel better almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why concentrates are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so popular So the first
time you take a dab be prepared be sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: down be with friends And if you've never
smoked flour if you've never smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or marijuana, whatever you want
to call it I highly recommend starting off
[SPEAKER_01]: by smoking some weed Start off like most
of us did it's kind of intense just to go
[SPEAKER_01]: straight to dabbing I would assume I
smoked weed for a long time before I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked a dab So that that is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the first time I smoked
dabs I smoked plenty of crappy melt hash
[SPEAKER_01]: and weird hash and all kinds of bullshit
hash up until this point and then one day
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend of mine we did a little uh,
I got some some flowers from him and he
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me this little parchment paper folded
in half and he goes hey bro when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: home put that on top of a bowl and just
give that a little hit and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that bh o butter stuff people were
talking about So I get home And I take a
[SPEAKER_01]: shower and I get ready to go out for the
night and I'm like I'm gonna go out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend I'm gonna go do some shit and I've
got plans with some friends and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh I want to get stoned before I go out
for the night And I remember he gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: that little parchment with that stuff in
it I've got a brand new pipe over there on
[SPEAKER_01]: the drawer So I get it get that pipe out
of the drawer And I put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: bud in there just enough to make sure that
shit doesn't fall through the hole and I
[SPEAKER_01]: put that little bit of wax in there it was
just it was more like shattered but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of it was like Melted shatter since
I'd had it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of got funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just put that it was shatter I put it
on top of the bowl and then I just melted
[SPEAKER_01]: it in with my lighter and I took one fat
hit of it and I blew it out And by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I was done blowing that smoke out I
was wandering to the bed with my eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed and half closed and I just laid
face down in the bed I wasn't like in a
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable position I just got to where I
was in the bed face down and I closed my
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes and I went to sleep for about an hour
and 20 minutes And I woke up and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh my god, I was still high I had to
get my shit together and then go out and I
[SPEAKER_01]: went places people were like dude How high
are you and I was like, bro, I smoked this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucked me up So that wasn't even a dab
that was just smoking a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate off of a bowl my first real
dab Was from a guy known as Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Daniel Desai from Top Shelf extracts
He had a booth at the first cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_01]: in Denver before it was recreated We had a
medical cannabis cup at the Xto event
[SPEAKER_01]: center and Big D had a booth with Broadway
Wellness and he had a decent line and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was offering dabs and I got in line and
the my date got in line in front of me I
[SPEAKER_01]: let her take a dab and when she took her
first dab, I had to catch her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She almost fell over She got wobbly and
shaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to put my arms around her and hold
her up I was like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes that shit hits hard and I was
like I can't fucking wait and I get up
[SPEAKER_01]: next in line and this big dude with a
shaved head he goes Are you a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you new and I go bro I smoke and he
goes, okay And he gave me a decent sized
[SPEAKER_01]: dab off of a swing arm skillet on a dub
tube I will talk more about that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future that dab fucked me up so bad I
don't think I smoked for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day I was so high and I coughed for 10
minutes, but it was a great thing I went
[SPEAKER_01]: back later that day and bought that dub
tube and one of those skillets so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could smoke those dabs all the time after
that So then I came home from that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cup and I called up all the
friends the next day I had Kevin over I
[SPEAKER_01]: had pops over pops I miss you brother Pops
passed a few months ago and I miss you
[SPEAKER_01]: pops, but I had Kevin over I had pops over
Mike was over pretty sure Tony was over
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't remember who else was there
But we all gathered at my house and I
[SPEAKER_01]: showed everybody this new device this new
apparatus and like that's fucking crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a swing arm skillet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looked like you took a bowl that
went on your bong like just a bowl that
[SPEAKER_01]: would fit into the bong but then you took
a longer stem and bent it so that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: upside down so that it looked like you'd
pack an upside down bowl is what it looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like but then they affixed a piece of
aluminum wire around it that had a
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium disc at the end of it like a coin
a coin of titanium and it would swing to
[SPEAKER_01]: where that titanium coin would line up
line up underneath the bottom of that the
[SPEAKER_01]: bell of the bowl Basically you would heat
up that titanium pad that coin swing it
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath there then drop your dab on
that titanium pad and that that nail that
[SPEAKER_01]: skillet would actually fit onto your bong
or your rig with a joint like your normal
[SPEAKER_01]: bong bowl would so then that would be
attached to your pipe or your bong or your
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble or whatever so then you'd put the
dab on you'd heat up the titanium swing
[SPEAKER_01]: the piece under then it would be
underneath the wide mouth of that bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: then you would put the dab on there and
you'd smoke and since it was like that
[SPEAKER_01]: bell shape it would suck the dab smoke
right up into there through your pipe and
[SPEAKER_01]: then into your lungs So I called the crew
over we all gathered in the basement we
[SPEAKER_01]: all sat around and we all looked at it
we're like wow that's crazy and I heated
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and back then you guys we were
heating the shit out of it we thought we
[SPEAKER_01]: had to heat these things so they were
fucking glowing that's not necessary we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna talk about dab heat in a minute also
I would heat it up and then we all took
[SPEAKER_01]: one or two dabs we all coughed for like
five or ten minutes I think we hung out
[SPEAKER_01]: for like 30 minutes total after that and
then we all said our goodbyes everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: like well bro I'm gonna go home I gotta go
do the rest of my day I didn't hear shit
[SPEAKER_01]: from anybody in that group until about six
hours later we all started texting each
[SPEAKER_01]: other like hey bro I just woke up from a
killer nap what the fuck are you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: like I just woke up that shit was amazing
I just woke up starving to death man I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it was hilarious everybody that
was here had to go home and take a little
[SPEAKER_01]: nap I didn't hear from them for at least
four to six hours each person so that was
[SPEAKER_01]: our first dab experience that was how I
acquired my first dabs how I took my first
[SPEAKER_01]: dab dabs were available in the
dispensaries by this point I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get them from my friend who had introduced
it to me also I worked in a local
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary so people were coming in and
offering us product all the time I was
[SPEAKER_01]: picking up concentrates from them plus I
was driving to Denver and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates all over the place at
dispensaries plus everybody around here
[SPEAKER_01]: was learning how to make their own
concentrates so that's a good way to segue
[SPEAKER_01]: into the evolution of the actual dabs
today I would be embarrassed to show you
[SPEAKER_01]: the dabs that we thought were the best
hottest fire shit four or five years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: then I guess the word would be mortified I
would be mortified to share with you dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: that we thought were good dabs six or
seven years ago concentrates have come a
[SPEAKER_01]: long way of course there was always decent
like water hash and bubble hash but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about BHO waxes shatters things
like that so when it first started people
[SPEAKER_01]: were making crap we called it poop soup it
was black it smelled like hell it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: properly purged it still you could tell it
still had residual butane in it you could
[SPEAKER_01]: tell something was wrong so when you're
making BHO you should use I prefer a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: tube some people will use stainless steel
I've seen people use aircraft aluminum
[SPEAKER_01]: tubes but you need metal or glass and I've
seen people use PVC tubes now you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running a solvent through this tube I
would imagine something from the PVC will
[SPEAKER_01]: end up in your concentrate I've seen
people use the shittiest weed I can only
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine what some of these people were
spraying on their weed before they were
[SPEAKER_01]: turning it into BHO what I'm saying is
back in the day you guys the stuff that we
[SPEAKER_01]: used to get was black and terrible and
funky and over time it got a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: clear and a little more clear and people
were learning how to make clear clear
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter shatter that was so let me explain
shatter because this was kind of how it
[SPEAKER_01]: first started with shatter and wax and
butter so first it was first it was this
[SPEAKER_01]: black solid not solid but like black layer
of stuff that looks like kind of like like
[SPEAKER_01]: black Jolly Ranchers like if you had a
dark Jolly Rancher a really dark purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Jolly Rancher on some parchment paper
that's what it looked like then it started
[SPEAKER_01]: getting more transparent and turning into
an amber honey color it looked like you
[SPEAKER_01]: had hardened honey or yellow Jolly
Ranchers on the parchment paper that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what shatter looked like it would
be thin sheets and it would be like amber
[SPEAKER_01]: colored glass and that would start that
started getting better that tasted better
[SPEAKER_01]: it had a better high to it it didn't make
your lungs hurt so bad and then we started
[SPEAKER_01]: learning to smoke it at a little cooler
temp and we're gonna talk about that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute too that also affected the the lung
burn on the chest burn and I apologize for
[SPEAKER_01]: clearing the throat a lot I've been taking
a lot of dabs but it got more clear and it
[SPEAKER_01]: got more shattery then we started learning
how to make waxes and batters out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: so wax was you would take a shatter that
was almost done and then you would just
[SPEAKER_01]: whip it you'd put a Dremel tool to it or
just whip it with the whisk real hard and
[SPEAKER_01]: put air in it and it would fluff it up and
make it into wax we learned how to purge
[SPEAKER_01]: things we learned that running the butane
through it put butane in it you had to get
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that butane out we started putting
our product into vacuum ovens to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: butane out we learned a lot of things so
it went from black goop to shatter which
[SPEAKER_01]: was basically amber colored glass or Jolly
Ranchers and then we learned how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: waxes out of that then we had butters or
batters which were kind of waxes that
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't solidify certain strains have
certain turps in it and certain things
[SPEAKER_01]: that just they all react differently so
sometimes you'll try to make you'll try to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a shatter and you'll end up with
what's called snap and peel which is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of more like a Laffy Taffy consistency
which is acceptable it's just what that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is gonna do so we learned how to
purge it we learned how to get all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: butane out because there were times when
you would throw a dab on a hot nail and it
[SPEAKER_01]: would sizzle up at you we would assume
that that was leftover solvent I have no
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence of that but that's what we
thought was happening then we started
[SPEAKER_01]: purging with the vacuum oven and things
got a lot better and a second ago I said
[SPEAKER_01]: Laffy Taffy but I totally meant a fruit
roll-up so excuse me for that it would
[SPEAKER_01]: snap like a fruit roll-up you know a fruit
roll-up you could just peel off a little
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of it snap and have that text that
texture I was more like a fruit roll-up so
[SPEAKER_01]: forget I said Laffy Taffy that just dawned
in my head so let me explain waxes a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit waxes and we're kind of
basically like smoking it was like wax you
[SPEAKER_01]: could handle it a little better you could
pick it up it wasn't shattery so shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: would snap sometimes you tried to get some
on the dabber and it would snap and it
[SPEAKER_01]: would break and go flying across the room
if you put too much pressure on it wax was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of easier to handle because you could
pick it up and you could drop it right
[SPEAKER_01]: into the nail so that was a difference and
a lot of people used to say that wax
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't purged and I'm not sure why people
would say that because the wax was just as
[SPEAKER_01]: purged if not more purged because it's
been through the same process as the
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter then it was whipped to make it
into the wax consistency and when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: whipped it released even more residual
hydrocarbon so the waxes are purged I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not sure why people always said that
that's what a wax is it kind of looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: a small piece of a fluffy crayon not as
maybe not as dense of a wax as a crayon
[SPEAKER_01]: but similar it's a just little pieces of
broken crayon maybe and you just need a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of that stuff that would get
you super high back in the day I like
[SPEAKER_01]: taking big old chunks and pressing a giant
chunk of wax onto the nail and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke as hard as I can and see when I had
to stop that was always fun so we started
[SPEAKER_01]: with that black goo we got that nice and
clear we learned how to get all the
[SPEAKER_01]: residual solvents out of it we started
learning how to preserve turps we started
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how to make nice and clear high
quality shatter shatter was the thing for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time shatter and wax and sometimes
butter if you could find some good butter
[SPEAKER_01]: that'd be alright a lot of people were
opposed to it they didn't like the
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency so shatter and waxes were the
hot thing for a long time then some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends here in Colorado got the bright
idea to cut down some plants and freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: them and run them fresh frozen through an
obi dose machine which is a closed loop
[SPEAKER_01]: system concentrate making machine if you
want if you're interested in a high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality closed loop machine look for an
obi dose from Emotec shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends at Emotec hit up Giddy up he'll
take good care of you but Kind Bill and a
[SPEAKER_01]: few other folks Kind Bill and Giddy
decided to put fresh frozen plants through
[SPEAKER_01]: an obi dose machine so when you're making
ice wax or water hash it's a good idea to
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze the buds the frozen buds work
better when you're making water hash they
[SPEAKER_01]: thought instead of drying the plants let's
cut them down and freeze them and put them
[SPEAKER_01]: through the BHO machine the obi dose the
butane extraction device so they went that
[SPEAKER_01]: method and what came out they named it
live resin because that fresh freezing
[SPEAKER_01]: process they cut down the plants took off
the large leaves and then froze them then
[SPEAKER_01]: ran them through the machine that fresh
freezing process preserved all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh plant terpenes that essence of the
freshly harvested plant it brought that
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the concentrate and it made this
bright gold mushy fluffy textury delicious
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know it was for a long time
everybody was crazy about live resin it
[SPEAKER_01]: was all people would talk about for the
longest time so live resin was made from
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen plants through an obi dose
machine Giddy up and Kind Bill were some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the first folks making live resin
because it was done in Giddy's machine
[SPEAKER_01]: then our friends at the Garden of Whedon
of course ran a bunch of live resin and
[SPEAKER_01]: won some cannabis cups with that so the
live resin became the thing everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted that live resin live resin was the
way to go that really revolutionized the
[SPEAKER_01]: machines it revolutionized extracting and
it put some science into it and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that inspired people because out of the
live resin people learned how to separate
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes and the cannabinoids for a
little while now we've been able to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: jars of strain specific terpenoids
terpenes so I've got a little vial in my
[SPEAKER_01]: hand this is a one dram vial it contained
one gram excuse me for clearing the throat
[SPEAKER_01]: again I apologize I usually edit those out
but we're gonna keep going it contained
[SPEAKER_01]: one gram of lemon Jeffrey high terpene
full spectrum extract it was about 99%
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and less than 1% cannabinoids and
this little jar a long time ago when we
[SPEAKER_01]: were making shatter and live resin I would
see these little shimmery pockets you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: have a sheet so if you ran a quarter pound
of flowers you would end up with about an
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce of concentrate and that's a
parchment paper about the size of a
[SPEAKER_01]: notebook piece of paper with a puddle
right in the middle of it that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: your ounce of concentrate somewhere in
that puddle I would see a little extra
[SPEAKER_01]: shimmery spot that looked like you just
dropped just a little bit of water in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and I would I would pay attention I
would dab off the edge of the edge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate this edge over here of the
whole slab we call those a big slab but
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got an ounce that's a slab I guess
an ounce or more would work as a slab
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe seven grams or more that's a slab of
concentrate if you saw it on the parchment
[SPEAKER_01]: paper saw it laying out and say oh that's
a slab so I would go from this edge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slab and then this edge of the slab and I
would compare the flavors based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: texture some would be one edge of the slab
may be harder than the other maybe because
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got this big 28 gram piece of
concentrate that was made it was liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's solidified again so now it's
non-homogeneous I feel that some parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: that are gonna contain different things I
think those little wetter puddles in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle that I was spotting were the turps
we were already kind of separating the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes from the cannabinoids because I
would reach into the middle where those
[SPEAKER_01]: little water pockets were and dab that and
it would taste so good I'm sure that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the turp pockets were hidden so now
we went from the goop to the waxes and
[SPEAKER_01]: shatters to live resin now we learned how
to pull out terpenes I was buying turps
[SPEAKER_01]: and taking chunks of live resin and chunks
of shatter and dumping dunking it right
[SPEAKER_01]: into the terpenes and then taking a fat
dab of that that would be tremendous that
[SPEAKER_01]: used to make I feel like the terpenes
would enhance the high by a good
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage the terpenes are not cheap when
you're buying cannabis derived terpenes so
[SPEAKER_01]: it definitely was an experience at that
time they were way more expensive then
[SPEAKER_01]: than they are now they're about a third of
the price now from when they first came
[SPEAKER_01]: out but that's because a lot more people
have learned the tech and they're more
[SPEAKER_01]: available and that's what happens with
legalization so along with the turps came
[SPEAKER_01]: the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
if you look listen to the podcast often
[SPEAKER_01]: you've heard us have a few vague
conversations about making a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts it happens when there is a
solution under pressure there is butane
[SPEAKER_01]: let's just kind of skip the process but
anyway there's a jar and the part that
[SPEAKER_01]: floats to the top is mainly the turps the
crystals that form in the bottom are the
[SPEAKER_01]: high cannabinoid full spectrum extract if
you leave those crystals in the bottom for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time undisturbed with no vibration
you don't open it up you don't cause it
[SPEAKER_01]: any drama it's gonna form a large diamond
if you're doing it correctly so now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting small chunks that we call HCFSE
also known as little crystals and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting HTFSE so you can get the high
terpene full spectrum extract the top
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid part that's all turps so you can
buy one strand of HCFSE crystals and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can buy a couple of different
varieties of HTFSE and you can pour up and
[SPEAKER_01]: make different varieties and different
flavors just like when you used to mix the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jelly Bellies back in the day so you can
buy one gram of one two grams of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can have different flavors you can
mix and match you can pour them together
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can just smoke the crystals by
themselves it's always fun I like to take
[SPEAKER_01]: the crystals and mix them in with some
batter and some turps that's always a good
[SPEAKER_01]: hide the batter gives you a good long
punch the turps give it a good flavor and
[SPEAKER_01]: a good head rush and then that HCFSE
crystal makes you go super high so so
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got your HCFSE small crystals then
you've got your HTFSE which is the liquids
[SPEAKER_01]: of the high terpene full spectrum extract
you buy a jar of like a gram of we'll say
[SPEAKER_01]: just a gram of Gorilla Glue high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get another gram of Jack Flash
high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals then you go get yourself a couple
of jars of turps maybe some lemon jeffery
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a cheese and then you can pour a
few drops of this one over here and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take a dab of the Gorilla Glue
high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals with some lemon jeffery turps on
top of it you can experience that high
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can get your cheese I don't even
remember the strains I said you guys but
[SPEAKER_01]: you can mix and match that way you've got
a little mix and match and it's really fun
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you definitely do notice
different highs from different
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations so we got to making our own
full spectrum extracts then came the
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds we learned that if you leave
those crystals under pressure in solution
[SPEAKER_01]: long enough they create gigantic diamonds
and a lot of people like dabbing just big
[SPEAKER_01]: old diamonds I think the diamonds get me
ridiculously high I think the diamonds
[SPEAKER_01]: need a little bit of turps added to them
you got to add a couple of drops of turps
[SPEAKER_01]: to the diamonds or it's a little too
intense I think that the THC a crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: the diamonds make you go super duper high
you skyrocket high like a firework I think
[SPEAKER_01]: the turpings that you add to that are the
color your firework makes that may be a
[SPEAKER_01]: weird way to describe it but the turps are
what decide if you're gonna get paranoid
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're gonna get the munchies if you're
gonna get laid back if you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: talkative the turps decide what's going to
happen and the THC decides how high you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna go with that is what I feel and when
there's no turps to it you just go real
[SPEAKER_01]: high and you kind of get a headache and
then you sober up real quickly is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like so it needs some turps to
control the drive or the rocket just goes
[SPEAKER_01]: flying off the rails and then it crashes
and it's done so that's the crystals the
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds by themselves when you take the
high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds that are kind of chunky and you
pour the turps over them and you see those
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds floating in the liquid turps and
sure if you guys pay attention to social
[SPEAKER_01]: media you see people with little jars and
they've got this golden liquid stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they've got these little chunks
just floating around in there these little
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals that is what's being called sauce
those are diamonds those are HTFSE
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals floating around in turp sauce you
guys that's cannabinoids and turp sauce
[SPEAKER_01]: just all floating around to me that's kind
of the most desirable way to smoke right
[SPEAKER_01]: now I like a pretty good sized crystal
with just a little bit of the turp sauce
[SPEAKER_01]: on it I like the high from the crystal
like I was saying earlier and then I like
[SPEAKER_01]: the turp sauce just to guide that high
give it a direction and also add some
[SPEAKER_01]: turbo flavor to it so that seems to be the
trend right now is the sauce the crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: the turps and the diamonds seems to be the
way to go also we've got to talk about our
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless friends I am not much on the
solventless smoke if you pass me a
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless dab hell yes I will take it do
I buy solventless concentrates very very
[SPEAKER_01]: rarely it's got to be very impressive to
get me to buy a solventless concentrate I
[SPEAKER_01]: would rather buy some sauce because
they're about the same price sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless excuse me with the throat once
again it's 710 not gonna edit it keep
[SPEAKER_01]: going take a dab with me every time every
time I clear my throat in this episode you
[SPEAKER_01]: take a dab that'll be fun here we go but
solventless is sometimes more expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: than sauce is what I think I was saying
let's talk more about solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless includes stuff like ice wax if
you see the kids that show up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary with a cooler and they leave
with a little cooler they're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: buying ice wax they keep it cool until the
moment they dab it those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested in a cool environment they're
stored in a cool environment possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen I'm not sure they are processed in
a cold environment they are made with ice
[SPEAKER_01]: water then they're grated up in a cold
environment the entire process they are
[SPEAKER_01]: kept in a very cool environment until the
minute they are dabbed a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to smoking solvents our friend
Jinxproof won't smoke butane hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent made hash because he's epileptic
and he's afraid to smoke something made
[SPEAKER_01]: with butane which is respectable so a lot
of people go for the solventless they like
[SPEAKER_01]: the ice wax or the water hash also there
is rosin rosin is made a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways rosin can be made and I'm
just gonna give you that I don't make
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin and if you listen to me a lot you
know I don't enjoy smoking rosin but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not biased I'm gonna try to give you guys
a fair report on rosin you make rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: basically by putting a nugget into a
little mesh pouch a very specific micron
[SPEAKER_01]: mesh pouch I'm not sure of the specific
micron because like I said this is not my
[SPEAKER_01]: wheelhouse but this is my understanding
you put a nugget or some nuggets in a mesh
[SPEAKER_01]: pouch a very specific micron mesh pouch
you then I think wrap that you fold that
[SPEAKER_01]: in parchment paper then you squish the
shit out of that with the press I've also
[SPEAKER_01]: seen people use a hair straightener to do
it they use a hot hair straightener and a
[SPEAKER_01]: clamp to tighten it down real tight you
want heat and pressure so then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna squish that bud with heat and
pressure and where that parchment paper or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's folded in half where it's not folded
the other side the open side you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: get some juice dripping out of there that
is your rosin that golden resin juice that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out of there that's rosin when you
unfold that parchment paper you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have right around your little square of
micron mesh bag you're gonna have all this
[SPEAKER_01]: goo that came out scrape that up that is
your rosin that you want to dab that is
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless and you can smoke that
immediately and it's kind of safe to make
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can enjoy the flavor and you can
get it the way you want it the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: the pressure just with a few simple tools
you can make dab able rosin at home from
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers know what a lot of people do they
will take some hash some water hash some
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash maybe it was some ice wax at
one point and they will press that into
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin and that makes really good rosin the
rosin that comes out of that once it's
[SPEAKER_01]: already been cleaned and you're not
pressing all that plant matter and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing water hash into rosin that makes
delicious rosin that's the best rosin I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you can make when you press hash
into rosin so shout out to our solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: friends I hope I did you guys justice on
honestly I don't smoke a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless if you want to come on the
show and talk about solventless and teach
[SPEAKER_01]: us about it you are more than welcome send
me an email it's
[SPEAKER_01]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com or if
you're one of my friends text me or hit me
[SPEAKER_01]: up on the Instagram and we can talk about
that another type of concentrate I should
[SPEAKER_01]: mention but I am honestly not a big fan of
is propane honey oil most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates I talked about before were
made with butane and other techniques
[SPEAKER_01]: there is you'll see pho on the shelves
when you shop at the dispensary that is
[SPEAKER_01]: propane honey oil yes we are making
concentrates with different gases
[SPEAKER_01]: different gases or different temperatures
they will bring out different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that the pho really brings
out good flavors but it makes my lungs
[SPEAKER_01]: feel really heavy when I smoke it it makes
everything come out kind of waxy it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of got that cheesecake batter sort of a
texture to it and it doesn't taste too bad
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really makes my lungs heavy and it
doesn't have the proper high I don't enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: the high to pho so that's another thing
that I should mention is available so you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys we went from smoking do do just seven
or eight years ago we were smoking crap
[SPEAKER_01]: just just the muckiest crappiest stuff
that would be different colors it'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: brown it would be black it would sizzle on
the nail it would give you a headache
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it would make your throat burn
and now the concentrate that I've got in
[SPEAKER_01]: my hand is super super clear I can see my
finger through the bottom of the jar and
[SPEAKER_01]: there are just little little diamonds
sitting in here it's not the same color
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to compare this to the beauty
of a little hot cocoa with little
[SPEAKER_01]: marshmallow on the top you know those
little little tiny marshmallows that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what these little diamonds look like in
here and they're just cascaded throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: this little little turp sauce and it
smells wonderful it smells like orange
[SPEAKER_01]: candies and jet fuel it's so delicious
this is the reba jam from green dot labs
[SPEAKER_01]: so guys we went from smoking crap to
smoking the best stuff on the planet in
[SPEAKER_01]: just a few years and that's because of
legalization so that is the evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: the dabs now let's talk about some of the
dab equipment let's talk about nails at
[SPEAKER_01]: first I talked about the skillet that's
that upside down bong bowl with the piece
[SPEAKER_01]: that swings underneath it and then you
heat that piece you swing it under there
[SPEAKER_01]: and you set your dab on there and hope it
doesn't run off of there onto your leg
[SPEAKER_01]: while it's still hot because that's
happened and it's fucking hot and it sucks
[SPEAKER_01]: so we started off with the skillet then we
learned to use a nail now a nail you had
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a male rig most so if you've got a
bong it's probably a female your bong bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: fits into the stem right now imagine if
that stem or the male part and the bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: fit on the outside that would be called a
direct inject bowl is what that is if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had a direct inject bowl that's a male you
just set the dab nail right in there they
[SPEAKER_01]: made a dab nail it kind of looks like a
big nail it would be excuse me it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium hopefully titanium you want a
quality titanium nail you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke some Chinese stuff because you're
gonna heat it up it's gonna off gas I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not gonna rant about that but a titanium
nail I recommend highly educated titanium
[SPEAKER_01]: so you get a titanium nail it is kind of a
it looks like a nail it's got a head on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it's got a long body right but it
would have another piece on it that would
[SPEAKER_01]: screw up and down and make it adjustable
so you could adjust the height that piece
[SPEAKER_01]: would sit and so you drop it right into
the male part of the rig and you'd adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: that nail to where it would fit into the
rig and stick out enough to where then you
[SPEAKER_01]: would slide a dome over it so you would
heat the nail then you would slide a dome
[SPEAKER_01]: just like you would put your bowl onto the
bong you would slide a dome over that nail
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would fit over there and the
purpose of that is then you would take
[SPEAKER_01]: your dab and touch that hot nail with it
and the smoke would kind of stay it would
[SPEAKER_01]: be trapped in that dome and then you would
smoke through the bong or the bubble or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're using and you would hit it
that way so we went from the skillet to
[SPEAKER_01]: the nail and dome method the nail was a
little archaic but it worked very well I
[SPEAKER_01]: would see a lot of people try to carve the
nail and burn the shit out of themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: it took a little while for people to catch
on to the nail tech it took a long time to
[SPEAKER_01]: teach people not to heat the fuck out of
their nail I still take a pretty hot dab
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day everybody was going even
hotter than me we had to teach people to
[SPEAKER_01]: mellow down on that some people still
don't want to hear it including myself I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess so you had the nail with the dome on
it you're probably familiar with that then
[SPEAKER_01]: task rock started making different types
of nails and he made the flux nail the
[SPEAKER_01]: flux was my favorite check out the flux
nail by highly educated when I used a
[SPEAKER_01]: domed nail the flux was my go-to but then
task came out with the domeless nail so
[SPEAKER_01]: the domeless nail kind of looked like a
rook from a chess set you guys it looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like the rook on a chess set and I got to
write something down here because I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: write down carb cap the carb cap changed a
lot of stuff when it came to dabbing I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't write that down so the the domeless
nail kind of looked like you took a rook
[SPEAKER_01]: and set it right on your pipe right on
your rig it was shaped like it tapered it
[SPEAKER_01]: was wider at the bottom and it tapered up
and then it had this wide head on it with
[SPEAKER_01]: like a dish with a piece up at the top in
the center of the dish it looked like it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of had an axle that was hollow so it
had a dish you could drop your dab in but
[SPEAKER_01]: the center had a wall around it so that
your dab wouldn't fall right down the hole
[SPEAKER_01]: but you could smoke and the smoke would go
up and then down that hole through the rig
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could hit it I think I described
that accurately imagine you took a rook
[SPEAKER_01]: from a chess set drill the hole right
through the top of it and set that
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucker right on top of your nail
that's kind of what it looked like but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you dropped your nail right on there it
would fall through the hole in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: right so they just put a little ring
around that so it didn't fall through now
[SPEAKER_01]: you got yourself a dish with a hole you'd
smoke on there now that was cool but you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to heat that thing real hot to hit it
and you would put your dab on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the smoke would get away and then
you'd choke a lot because it was so hot so
[SPEAKER_01]: task invented a thing called a carb cap a
carb cap was another piece of titanium
[SPEAKER_01]: that fit perfectly on top of your domeless
nail now that carb cap would trap the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of your nail and it would minimize
the amount of outside air that was allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass the surface of that nail which
would stoke the heat of the nail and make
[SPEAKER_01]: your dab burn better at a lower
temperature so now you were getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: better flavored dab because you weren't
burning off the turps it wasn't burning
[SPEAKER_01]: your lungs it wasn't burning your throat
and you didn't have to use so much heat to
[SPEAKER_01]: get all of your smoke you would drop a big
old dab on there and you'd cap it and that
[SPEAKER_01]: heat would remain inside the nail because
it was covered and then you could just
[SPEAKER_01]: keep pulling on it until you get all of it
otherwise you had to heat it real hot and
[SPEAKER_01]: just try to get as much smoke as you could
to try to take a big dab and part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: carb cap evolved from people were taking a
domeless nail and placing their thumb or
[SPEAKER_01]: two fingers over the whole of the dome to
kind of minimize and restrict the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of airflow to get a lower temperature dab
is kind of what inspired the carb cap so
[SPEAKER_01]: we went from the domed nail to the
domeless nail to the dome domeless nail
[SPEAKER_01]: with a carb cap then somewhere along that
point task rock invented the e nail the e
[SPEAKER_01]: nail was a domeless nail with a coil
coming off of it that had a wire that went
[SPEAKER_01]: to a box that would regulate the
temperature of that coil that would heat
[SPEAKER_01]: that nail so you didn't have to use a
torch to heat your dab nail anymore it was
[SPEAKER_01]: electric and it was always running you'd
plug that son of a bitch in you'd dial it
[SPEAKER_01]: to a temperature you'd wait a couple of
minutes for it to heat up once it's hot
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be hot until you turn it off so
you could take a dab I could pass it to
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Kevin would take a dab we'd pass it
over to Dee Dee would take a dab and pass
[SPEAKER_01]: it back to me and I'd take another dab and
he'd realize oh my goodness this thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a problem and everybody got so
stoned when the e-nails started first
[SPEAKER_01]: coming around so shout out to our friend
task rock for making the first e-nail he
[SPEAKER_01]: gets credit for that you guys he gets the
first e-nail there have been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that have made a lot of e-nails
after that but task did it first so shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to task rock and the e-nail um
somewhere along the line so the e-nail got
[SPEAKER_01]: popular then we started seeing things
called the banger and the club banger the
[SPEAKER_01]: quav banger quave banger you can say quav
or quave I'm not sure how you say it I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been corrected both ways so go with
whichever one you're comfortable with but
[SPEAKER_01]: this dude quave made a thing called a
banger it was probably the most commonly
[SPEAKER_01]: seen dabbing nail after the original
titanium nail it's the one you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: most the one most copied the most knocked
off it fits on your rig and it comes up
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it has an angle to where it gets
horizontal it's either got a 45 or a 90
[SPEAKER_01]: degree angle probably on it to where that
the dish part sits horizontally then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just basically got a glass thimble on it
and you heat it and you drop your dab in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then you smoke it and you put a
carb cap over it and then let me write
[SPEAKER_01]: down bubble caps too because we didn't
talk about bubble caps because when we get
[SPEAKER_01]: to these other things we're gonna need a
bubble cap so basically the banger looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like a piece of glass at an angle that
attaches to your rig or your pipe with a
[SPEAKER_01]: thimble on it and then you would heat that
and when it got to the right temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: you drop your dab inside of there put a
carb cap on it and at this point in time a
[SPEAKER_01]: carb cap was just a flat piece with a hole
in it so that you could restrict the air
[SPEAKER_01]: then we started getting directional carb
caps it would have a little piece of glass
[SPEAKER_01]: it would just point the air in a certain
direction and you would turn it to move
[SPEAKER_01]: the oil around in your nail a little
better because people were taking big dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was the kind of the start of the
club banger is what they called it the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass version of a nail from the banger we
started seeing variations of that we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the gavel from highly educated we saw the
trough from who made the trough we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: think of who made the trough right now Joe
Peters then we saw the Joel Halen honey
[SPEAKER_01]: hole which was very similar to the trough
we saw the grail from Toro then we saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: core reactor which was kind of these are
all just variations on the on the original
[SPEAKER_01]: banger and they're just slightly different
but the core reactor was bigger and it had
[SPEAKER_01]: a piece like a hump of glass in the middle
of it that would hold a little bit of heat
[SPEAKER_01]: longer so you could take larger dabs at
lower temperatures it was just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: banger just like the quaff banger but it
had a larger chunk of glass in the very
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of it that would hold the heat so
that was the core reactor then we started
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the thermal banger which I'm gonna
try to describe to you now I've got one in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of me it's what I've been hitting it
is just like the normal banger so you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got the joint that fits onto my rig it
just sets right on the rig like a bong
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl would and it's got a 90 degree angle
then it's got it looks like a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: thimble honestly just a piece of just a
glass looks like a little glass jar or a
[SPEAKER_01]: glass thimble or a glass pepsi lid from a
pepsi bottle it's about that size and it
[SPEAKER_01]: is attached to this glass 90 degree angle
then inside of that is another glass dish
[SPEAKER_01]: that looks like a smaller thimble so it's
like a thimble inside of a thimble and the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea is that you heat the outer thimble
and the heat never touches that inside
[SPEAKER_01]: thimble so it doesn't get dirty and funky
and you don't burn your dab is bad so you
[SPEAKER_01]: heat the outside part you drop your dab in
there then you put a bubble cap over it
[SPEAKER_01]: above the bubble cap is shaped it's a
bubble with a piece of tubing so imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: you took a straw and heated it and you
blew on it and it expanded in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: and you put a bubble in it that's what a
bubble cap would look like then you cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: off short on both ends so part of that the
bubble seals the cap the banger so now
[SPEAKER_01]: it's sealed off you drop the bubble cap on
there it's sealed one end of it points
[SPEAKER_01]: down inside of the banger and one end of
it points up and you turn it and when you
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it that moves your oil around inside
there and it gets nice and deep inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the banger so it moves that oil around
inside the bottom of the banger so your
[SPEAKER_01]: oil moves and doesn't stay in one place
and it burns the whole dab and you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice low temp dab that tastes really nice
so that is and you also use that carb cap
[SPEAKER_01]: on the the core reactor banger so that is
kind of the evolution of we went from the
[SPEAKER_01]: titan the skillet to the nail to the flux
to the domeless to the enail then we
[SPEAKER_01]: started using bangers and yes they do make
so bangers are glass or quartz if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: paying like 20 or 30 bucks they're glass
if you're paying 180 150 they're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: quartz I hope you can get a quartz enail
you can get a banger with an enail
[SPEAKER_01]: attachment yes that is a thing I really
appreciate that I enjoy the way that works
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that tastes and the way that dabs
so we've talked about the core reactor we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about the thermal banger we talked
about the gavel the trough the grail those
[SPEAKER_01]: are just different versions you guys from
different makers let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket the bucket is what mothership uses
the bucket fits it looks like a bong bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks just like you're gonna pack a
bong bowl but it's got this little hinge
[SPEAKER_01]: on it and that hinge has a piece that
swings out and it's got a little titanium
[SPEAKER_01]: dish on there you swing it out you heat
that titanium dish you swing it back in
[SPEAKER_01]: and when it cools to the proper temp then
you drop your dab on there and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: use what's called the OFZ is what the carb
cap is that fits on the mothership bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: there's also this new thing called the
knot I'm not sure what it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: called it looks like a pretzel knot it is
ridiculous it looks like the hat you dry
[SPEAKER_01]: you heat it and then you drop in this
other thing and then you put your dab and
[SPEAKER_01]: you heat another thing and drop that
inside of it and it looks like the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: falls to the bottom and keeps recycling up
to the top I am not familiar with it
[SPEAKER_01]: granny does not like it there's another
thing from Toro that kind of looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bird feeder I'm pretty sure that's from
Toro I've never tried that it doesn't look
[SPEAKER_01]: it just doesn't look like it makes sense
to me it looks like I would rather dab off
[SPEAKER_01]: of a banger you guys will see that one
online the one you drop the dab in the top
[SPEAKER_01]: then it falls to the bottom somehow and it
looks it's shaped like a fucking Coleman
[SPEAKER_01]: lantern it looks like a bird feeder or
something I'm not a fan of that thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't used it but still it just looks
like it's more cumbersome than it's worth
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like a pain in the ass and it
doesn't make sense to me also there are
[SPEAKER_01]: insert dabs insert dabs kind of you have a
bigger banger and then you heat the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: banger and then you put your dab inside of
a smaller like a just a glass dish and you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually set that inside of the banger and
then you put a carb cap on there and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you give it a second for the heat to work
its way to your dab and then you toke on
[SPEAKER_01]: it and that way you can just pull out that
little dish when you're done the insert
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can clean that dish off and you
have a clean nice turpy dab every time it
[SPEAKER_01]: always tastes delicious and it always
tastes fresh because a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to smoke off of a burnt-out chas'd
banger if your banger is all black and
[SPEAKER_01]: funky looking and needs some attention
that's called it's chas'd and you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked it up and a lot of hash snubs are
not gonna want to smoke off of that with
[SPEAKER_01]: you so that's most of the bangers and nail
styles that I can think of right now I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I missed a couple I'm sure something
has come out since I've made this episode
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I'm not on top of everything but
that's a lot of what you're gonna see also
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got nectar collectors nectar
collectors are kind of like a rig but
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of dropping the dab into the nail
you heat up the tip of the nectar
[SPEAKER_01]: collector and you put your concentrate
into a dish and the nectar collector is
[SPEAKER_01]: made to be held vertically so it's up and
down and you hold the dish in your hand
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you kind of smoke it like an
anteater you look like an anteater it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're using a giant straw just to
suck up a dab you heat up the tip of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you press that hot tip up against the
dab and you get a huge dab out of that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people love a nectar collector it's
like basically a dab straw that runs
[SPEAKER_01]: through water a dab straw is just a piece
of glass that's tapered at one end you
[SPEAKER_01]: heat up that one end real hot you press
that up against your dabs and you suck
[SPEAKER_01]: through the other end it's a way to take a
dab but it's really hot and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable for me a nectar collector is
a very upgraded way to do that because it
[SPEAKER_01]: filters your dab through water I always
prefer my dab to go through water to cool
[SPEAKER_01]: it down a little bit for me so I guess
that's a good way to segue into rig
[SPEAKER_01]: selection I prefer a small rig there's no
reason to smoke your dabs out of a big-ass
[SPEAKER_01]: bong you're not so let's think about the
reason you're smoking through a bong you
[SPEAKER_01]: pack a bowl you light that bowl you've got
a big 12 18 2 foot bong right you 24 inch
[SPEAKER_01]: bong you're smoking you fill that big-ass
chamber with all that thick smoke you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see that cloud coming out it's coming up
at you you're looking at it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: tube like all that smoke is about to go
into my head and then once you get it all
[SPEAKER_01]: filled up with as much as you think you
can handle you pull that carb you suck all
[SPEAKER_01]: that smoke in and you get that loud water
noise and you try not to splash it up on
[SPEAKER_01]: your face and you get a big old bong hit
you cough and then you put the bowl back
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and you pass it to your friend
you're like I'm fucking stoned bong hits
[SPEAKER_01]: feel great that's a great thing I love a
giant bong hit but I don't want to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: dab out of a big old bong hit because as
soon if I heat the nail as soon as that
[SPEAKER_01]: dab touches the nail I carb cap it and I'm
starting to get smoke already the smoke is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming there's no need to start filling a
chamber I don't want to suck 12 inches 18
[SPEAKER_01]: or 24 inches of glass of air of oxygen to
my lungs before I even get my dab I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to smoke a gallon of air I'm trying
to smoke a gram of concentrates so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need a big bong I want a little tiny piece
I like what they call a sidecar the rig
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hitting right now is made by hitman
hitman doesn't sponsor the show a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people hate on hitman I like the way this
rig functions I could it doesn't matter to
[SPEAKER_01]: me who made this I like the way this rig
hits this rig is probably five inches tall
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about the size around it's the size
around of my torch it's almost the same
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter of my torch it's like perfectly
the size it fits right in a cup holder you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys the base of this fits right in a cup
holder I didn't say that but it fits right
[SPEAKER_01]: in a cup holder okay it's a little smaller
than the diameter of a Pepsi can it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little thicker around than my torch if
it's really nice in a cup holder it's
[SPEAKER_01]: about four inches tall then it's got a
little mouthpiece coming off of it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: a can shape they call that a can and it's
got a mouthpiece coming off of it that's
[SPEAKER_01]: another four or five inches long and that
mouthpiece I like a nice flared out
[SPEAKER_01]: mouthpiece so that my lips fit into it and
I don't have to make that that blowjob
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth to try to take a dab also I don't
like a skinny mouthpiece because I take
[SPEAKER_01]: big dabs and I feel like when you take a
big dab with a skinny mouthpiece and you
[SPEAKER_01]: got a mustache like I do a lot of
concentrate just gathers right there in
[SPEAKER_01]: your mustache and it's kind of funky to
have sticky lips you guys have heard me do
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts with sticky lips from small
mouthpiece rigs so then it's got a male
[SPEAKER_01]: joint sticking straight up off the top the
very center the main portion of this rig
[SPEAKER_01]: is just shaped like a circle or a can it's
just a can it's a small can so then I
[SPEAKER_01]: described the mouthpiece now right on the
top and the dead center of that can is
[SPEAKER_01]: where the male joint sticks up and on that
joint I have got a it's a 14 inch joint
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've got a 14 inch thermal banger on
there and I'm using a bubble cap tonight
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's basically my dab setup and I'm
using a little just a glass pencil as a
[SPEAKER_01]: dabber from tater glass shout out to tater
I prefer a small rig you guys nothing too
[SPEAKER_01]: big something that's kind of like hand
size you don't want anything much bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: than that there's no need to smoke a
gallon of oxygen before your dad gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: you so a little rig is best in my opinion
a little sidecar is best let's see what
[SPEAKER_01]: else do I want to mention we're getting
close to an hour and I've still got a few
[SPEAKER_01]: notes that I want to make sure let's talk
about the evolution of rigs when rigs
[SPEAKER_01]: first came out most of them had what was
known as an 18 millimeter joint that joint
[SPEAKER_01]: was 18 millimeters around it's kind of a
big joint the way that I used to remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of that one if I went to the
store to go shopping and they didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference in the 14 or the 18 that
was the one that kind of fits right over
[SPEAKER_01]: the tip of my pinky finger that's the 18
millimeter joint then we went a little
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller we went to 14 millimeter joints 14
millimeter is about the size around of a
[SPEAKER_01]: big pen without the cap so if you can just
fit your big pen in there that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: a 14 millimeter joint there you got a 14
millimeter male or female joint then
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody wanted to go smaller everybody
thought that a little tiny teeny tiny rig
[SPEAKER_01]: was best so people started going with 10
millimeter those are really tiny a pin
[SPEAKER_01]: won't fit in there you got to clean that
step down stem out with a q-tip if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to clean it so we evolved from 18 to
14 to 10 and then I think most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people went back to a tent or to a 14 is
about where we stayed the 10 got clogged
[SPEAKER_01]: up and you can't take a giant dab off a 10
mil rig in my opinion someone's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: argue with me but I don't like doing it
I'd rather have a 14 that's my preferred
[SPEAKER_01]: size 18 that's not bad you just get a lot
of airflow a little restriction on the
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow is not bad but I don't want that
10 mil so we went from 18 to 14 to 10 I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that kind of covers a lot of the
evolution of rigs you guys rigs can be
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from $30 to $30,000 I've seen a
hundred and one thousand dollar rig before
[SPEAKER_01]: so get what suits you don't be out there
trying to impress people with your rig get
[SPEAKER_01]: what works this rig I'm hitting out of
right now was $150 to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna say holy shit that's
expensive a lot of people out there are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna go really bro that's all you're
smoking out of your rasta Jeff you're
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting $150 hit man yeah it works
perfectly this rig has a perfect perk
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of it I like the way it percolates
I like the way it fits on my face it's
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable I like holding it I like the
way it goes in my hand the way it fits to
[SPEAKER_01]: my hand to my face when I'm dabbing I
don't have to reach awkwardly I like this
[SPEAKER_01]: rig it doesn't splash in my mouth get a
rig that's comfortable for you don't buy
[SPEAKER_01]: something to impress your friends don't
get something that splashes water up in
[SPEAKER_01]: your mouth don't get something that you
got to get all cross-eyed trying to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: hit out of get a rig that's comfortable
for you one more thing I want to rant on
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're gonna wrap up this
hour-long 710 episode of this podcast you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys a lot of people ask me what temp do
you set your email at I like to set my
[SPEAKER_01]: temp on my email at what works for me I
can't make a recommendation for you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got a different unit than
me you've got a different box that box is
[SPEAKER_01]: sending a frequency up that cable to that
coil to the top of your nail there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: way that that box knows what the
temperature is on the top of your nail so
[SPEAKER_01]: setting that number on your box is just
like setting the number of volume on your
[SPEAKER_01]: car stereo you find where it sounds really
good I know that in my car stereo about 24
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 sounds pretty nice when I start hitting
26 it gets kind of crackly 27 28 sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit it's not even worth going there
so I rock about 23 24 all the time find
[SPEAKER_01]: where your dab temperature is comfortable
with your dab nail maybe you got to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: 500 maybe at 500 the dabs not melting
properly maybe you got to go to 600 maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: it's six it's still not going maybe you
got to go to 700 maybe around seven or
[SPEAKER_01]: eight hundred it starts to burn right
where you want it dial it in it may take
[SPEAKER_01]: you a few dabs it may cost you a couple of
grams to get that email dialed in but I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't recommend a number for you I could
say start at a certain number and then
[SPEAKER_01]: dial up or down from there but you kind of
have to dial it in to the way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: like it so that's my rant on dialing in
your email temperature we don't all have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same unit we don't all have the same
box we don't all have the same nail and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not all dabbing the same stuff so
dial it into the way that you like it
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you want that dab and use a carb cap
always use a carb cap it's gonna help you
[SPEAKER_01]: out dial it into where when you drop that
dab on there it starts to melt a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and put the carb cap on there and give
a good draw through it if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting any smoke turn it up a little bit
if you're getting way too hot way too
[SPEAKER_01]: thick too fast turn it down you'll figure
it out it'll only take a few dabs to get
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself in the right ballpark and then
you can dial it in and get it perfect from
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then just remember the number
here's here's a quick idea that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of maybe if you're dabbing and
you've got an email you've probably been
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbing off a normal nail before heat that
nail up heat it up and then feel it with
[SPEAKER_01]: your hand and when you go that's where I
want to be that's where I would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: dab get your email and plug it in and heat
that fucker up and play with it put your
[SPEAKER_01]: hand up to it and when they feel about the
same you're kind of close in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: ballpark right so get it to the same
temperature that you would heat it with
[SPEAKER_01]: your torch and it's a different nail keep
in mind it's a different nail it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: different nail surface it could be a
different kind of metal it could be one
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a banger one could be quartz one
could be glass and now you could be
[SPEAKER_01]: messing with the titanium email keep in
mind that you're gonna have different
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces to work with but heat one up with
the torch and then plug in that email and
[SPEAKER_01]: dial it in and see if you can get them
close if you can get that email to the
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar feeling of how you would do it
with the torch that's where you want it
[SPEAKER_01]: drop a dab on there hit it see if it works
for you you can always turn it up or down
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not gonna be your last dab
hopefully hopefully you got plenty more
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs coming your way you got plenty of
time to dial it in so that's my rant on
[SPEAKER_01]: email temperature you guys a lot of people
ask me what temp to set the email at and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really don't know to tell you because I
don't have your email and now that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect segue into the next and final part
of this podcast hot dabs versus low temp
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs a lot of people talk a lot of shit to
me because I like to take really really
[SPEAKER_01]: hot dabs that's just my thing I take
bigger dabs in the average person also I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like to take the big dab that I need
I need a little extra heat when I put that
[SPEAKER_01]: oil onto the nail it immediately starts
cooling the nail I'm not using an e-nail I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to use a quartz banger heat it with a
torch so as soon as something hits it
[SPEAKER_01]: before something hits it when I quit
applying heat it starts cooling I let it
[SPEAKER_01]: get kind of cooler it's still pretty hot
then I put my dab on there that rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: starts cooling it I've got to get my carb
cap on there and start swirling it around
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times the nail cools before I get
to consume all of the dab so I've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: go a little bit hotter that's just the way
I like it when you go a little hotter you
[SPEAKER_01]: also get this little punch in the chest
from it it's just a little extra a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: kids like to go a little low temp they
don't mind wasting a little bit they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: q-tip and they clean out the banger when
they're done that's not my style so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: like low temp dabs they see you get more
flavor out of it I may agree with that if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's your thing go for it if you're all
about the hot dabs if that's your thing go
[SPEAKER_01]: for it just don't go so hot that you cause
yourself health problems you guys be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful I know I joke around we talk about
glowy's and glow squad and we say red
[SPEAKER_01]: means go that's kind of an exaggeration
don't fuck your health up because of a hot
[SPEAKER_01]: dab be careful you'll notice one day
you'll take too hot of a dab you'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get in a hurry you'll get impatient
you'll heat it up you'll have your dab
[SPEAKER_01]: ready you'll be talking and you'll go in
and you'll go oh fuck I didn't wait it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be so hot just learn to time your dabs
heat it up let it cool till it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: scorching hot then hit your dab when it's
comfortable for you how you like it don't
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about what anybody else thinks dab
at your temperature alright you guys
