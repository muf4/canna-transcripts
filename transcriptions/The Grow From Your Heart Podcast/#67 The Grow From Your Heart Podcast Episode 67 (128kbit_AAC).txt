[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn down that music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of loud, and the headphones
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the reggae real loud in the
ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too loud, you're too old,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can turn down the volume on your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, there you go.

Mother's Day, May 10th.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dad, give your mom a hug for
me, and on Mother's Day, buy the bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping out every single one of us
stoner boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh shit, I would have forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you guys already have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good heads up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be out before Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my sponsor is your mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who I'm trying to get to promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not my mom, your mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, hey, Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's already an awkward start.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 10th is Mother's Day and we get to
brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what we're doing May 10th?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know what we're doing May 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I will be seeing Doug Benson
hosting his podcast, Doug Loves Movies at
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks, my favorite comedy club on
the damn planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only comedy club that's worth the
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're going to a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one we go to will be worth a shit
and then we'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Denver Improv, so I have to
back that place up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place was fucking sweet, but
ComedyWorks is my favorite comedy club on
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet that I've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to see Doug Benson there May 10th,
recording his podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are into Doug Benson,
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to give you a quick apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about the growers meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had very short notice that that was not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers meeting didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys showed up, I'm in my house
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the time of the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here recording, taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 7-10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the meeting should be
happening, but I got a free time,
[SPEAKER_00]: some free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came here and recorded a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work for High Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just simply trying to help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything is cool with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Burn, everybody at High
Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burn and Jesse, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get another meeting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do this to you guys again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson, we get to see him May 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start it off by saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope he does a better show than
he did when we saw him Monday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff came up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so shout out to my buddy,
Drew, because he'll be listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, shout out to my friend, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up realizing I had a plus one
available for the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called her about two and a half
hours before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, if you can get your cute
little ass to Denver from Pueblo to the
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant where we're all going to eat,
I will order you food and have a plate of
[SPEAKER_00]: food waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get there, you can grub
down and we got to get to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, please be here by this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she made it five minutes early,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to a girl that got ready,
got herself beautiful and drove to Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: in two and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got to come to the show with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and also shout out to your friend that
you brought with us, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I got to meet him and he
seems like a fun guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have common friends, so we're
definitely going to hang out and take some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were talking about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's Pueblo too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the same thing as like,
I just, we're one degree of separation
[SPEAKER_01]: from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: One degree of Kevin Bacon from every
single person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good meeting you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to hang out and
take some dabs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the picture of Drew's car right
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you took a little nappy poo,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fortunately it was after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to the car, but Drew, you did pass
the fuck out and it was hilarious to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, he kept, he kept like trying
to like lay over onto me as I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept having to like shove him back,
like get over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that or finish the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, tough guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suck my dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your car has got those big couch seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure he was just thinking he's
cuddled up on the couch with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most comfortable seats you've
ever ridden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: His car is a boat, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go on a cruise in Clint's car.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody coming out for the cruise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be going May 10th, Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's no cruise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we got to see Doug and we were
front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to the Mellow
Mushroom and Kelso Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made friends with this lovely
waitress at the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a fellow grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is an extract artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a fucking cool dog named Zephyr.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Kelso.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Zephyr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys are doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me, she told me that they
listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope they're checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not only an awesome waitress,
but she's a cool lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to her on Instagram and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She seems like a great chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out that Mellow Mushroom too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That place is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's a carnivore carnivorous meat
eating freak over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am a scrawny pussy hippie
vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can agree with that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying nothing, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a meal on that menu for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm completely satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sit across the table from each other
and belittle each other's food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all the grease coming off your
meat pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: You carnivore piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the shit that you should feed
my food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge shout out to The Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can go on to the Doug Benson
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We owe a shout out to Baker and
ComedyWorks also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to have some VIP preferred
seating status at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I let them know I'm coming in
advance, they will get me some VIP seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were front fucking row for Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to see him record his comedy special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the third time they had done that
show that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get on with that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show opened with Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you feel about Graham Elwood?
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham Elwood was one of the funniest guys
I've seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I was really fucking high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember a lot of what he said and
I would zone out like he'd go on some
[SPEAKER_01]: ramps and I'd just start zoning out
fucking high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, man, it would be cool to see
like what the inside of a rainbow looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was still talking about something like
his kid or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just went to the extra happy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked over a couple of times and I
could tell you were zoned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Graham Elwood's hilarious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a fake band known as the
Whistling Banes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to that Doug Benson podcast,
you will hear some Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also got his own podcast called The
Comedy Film Nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham actually invited me to the LA
Podfest in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me that there is a big room
where you can set up and everybody records
[SPEAKER_00]: their podcast out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that if I come, he would be on
my show and he shook my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I make it to LA Podfest,
you guys will hear Graham Elwood on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, he was a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I can't keep it in check
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said the F-bomb probably 15 times
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it so quietly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Graham amazed me because he was funny
and he was clean, which is hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like just more props to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he would ever listen to this,
I hope he would hear us say that he was
[SPEAKER_01]: the best part of that night because Doug
Benson came on after him and Doug,
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing he said, he goes, I woke up
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, yeah, let's remind the people
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he woke up, he started smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a 420 show up till he was,
he was smoking up until then.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kept smoking all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first thing he said is
like, he did all he could do to make it to
[SPEAKER_01]: where he couldn't make it to that last
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: His goal was to be too high to record that
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen, I've gotten Doug
Benson high several times and I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen him that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got high, and this sounds like bragging,
but I'm kind of, I'm not bros with Doug,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm internet buddies with Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Twitter friends with Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the comedians know who I am by
now because I've gone to enough shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he relies on Rasta Jeff to get him high
before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows I've got some dank weed and I'm
not psycho.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hits me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hit me up to get him high.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I got him high and he told me
from the stage, he fucked up a joke and
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at me and said, you got me too
high, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That night he was three or four times
beyond that level of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so fucking skinny-eyed,
fucking, you could not see.
[SPEAKER_00]: One eye was skinny, one eye was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one eye was working, kind of,
but it was fucking, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so baked that he just, it just
wasn't even that much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept putting his head on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys heard this sound a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was his head hitting the
microphone so that he could take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, I mean, and he was laughing at his
own jokes and there was some really
[SPEAKER_01]: hilarious shit that he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spent 30 minutes reading fucking
tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 30 minutes of his show,
he read tweets, which he usually spends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem was that 30 minutes was
only divided up by like five tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like a whole bunch of tweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like five people that were
audacious enough to pull their phone out
[SPEAKER_01]: in a comedy show and send him a shout out
or, and tweet at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, we're up front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that looks, he would, Graham was
staring at me because my phone was on my
[SPEAKER_00]: lap because it's too big for my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this iPhone six plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my phone was on my lap and Graham kept
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like grandma would looked at my
phone twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's got his fucking phone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then maybe if it was on your lap,
he was looking at something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was he looking at my package, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think Graham was checking it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was trying to see if he got any seeds
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I got plenty of seeds, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Doug Benson literally yawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to move the mic from his face and
yawn on stage performing his comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he actually said, this is my third time
recording this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to do is make sure to get
the jokes that I didn't get perfect the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, now don't, don't let me say anything
other than I respect him for being honest,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just didn't pay to go see a guy just
kind of muddle through something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to see a concert, I don't want
to watch Metallica do sound check five
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I picked Metallica.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, that would be, well, I mean,
maybe I want to watch them nail inner
[SPEAKER_00]: sand, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to watch them try to do some
song they haven't done right in a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't played this song properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try it in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I mean, Doug only did things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess he did things three times that day
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a couple of the bits twice because
he forgot he did one when he was doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's because he broke it off early in
the first part.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't tell like the same part of the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that was because he had a
pocketful of notes that were disheveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like, it looks like your grandpa
had gone to Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when grandpa comes home from
going out all day, he's got a pocket full
[SPEAKER_00]: of receipts and a couple of breath mints
and a fucking toothpick and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now grandpa's got a joint in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he had, there's like four or five
different colors of pieces of paper in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a receipt for Barnes and Noble
in there that I could see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he had scribbled on all of
it, but that's what, that's where his
[SPEAKER_01]: notes were, was in that handful of
grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept staring at all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handful of Grandpa is also the name of my
new metal band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we write that down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have, I have a use for the name
Handful of Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another project needs a name and if
you're not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, buddy, we're going to make
something out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, make sure you listen to my other
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Handful of Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been put out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint Stewart's the first guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may just be an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still this, that needs to be written
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry if I'm wasting time writing
down this phrase, Handful of Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have made it this far into
this podcast, we salute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second of all, you know, we're probably
not going to be talking too much about
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on this one, but the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing as people though.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I, now I remember why I forget to
bring comedians in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the listeners like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always have to be intense grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle, you could put your notebook
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be nothing to write down this
time other than the phrase Handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so, but so we had those disheveled
notes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's where we were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he just, and I think he needs
glasses to go with the notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He definitely needed to open his eyes a
little bit because they were fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody threw a joint on stage and it
took him two minutes to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He almost stepped on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've ever seen the comedy works
like stage, it's well lit and it's maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of your kitchen table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's not a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nothing on the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a blue carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did somebody say?
[SPEAKER_00]: The floor looked like somebody tweeted and
said, Oh yeah, a nail or a salon floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was weird, but it was,
it was vacuumed beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, no, but it was just like 30
minutes on five tweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was kind of boring, got into some
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he tried to do like other tweets
or something like later in the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't he doing tweet relief?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called watch this, not that is a game
that he plays on his show where he lets
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience members select movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he decides which one to watch,
but he was too high to keep track of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the other audience members were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was the things called promotional
tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we, we definitely felt like we
got used like a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt a little like, uh, like,
ah, you know what guys, it sucks to be
[SPEAKER_01]: you, but this is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's the way it has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we all were talking about it later,
I was like, so what'd you guys think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just waiting for someone to be
like, that was kind of fucking whack for
[SPEAKER_00]: my 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like you went and hung out with Doug
and then me and my boy drew took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all stupidly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were three carloads of people from
Pueblo with one or two people in each car
[SPEAKER_00]: because we didn't plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had come from the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came up on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I invited Danielle right after
you left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already in monument by the time she
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm proud of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: She made that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we all had to get in separate
cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we linked up and talked about it,
it was like, yeah, I felt like we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: were his guinea pigs test audience or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, shout out to Graham Elwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saved the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Doug, I'm not being disrespectful to
you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third show, man, you were too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I wasn't, I'm like a loyal Doug
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of neat for me to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've seen enough Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm watching my friend do
comedy now, whatever VIP seats and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was a normal civilian listener,
I might not have been impressed with that
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I told you, the only
interaction I've had with them is just
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to Doug loves movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not a whole lot of Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't watched Doug's specials before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first chance of seeing Doug
Benson and I was not impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it on the podcast before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe Doug's, uh, excessive
cannabis use may be slowing down his
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy and his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that our experience,
uh, solidifies my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sucks because cannabis shouldn't
be used as a slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be used as a way to move
yourself forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then, um, real quick,
and then we didn't bring this up before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when, when there was that,
he said, we're all going to go smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and I was like, all right,
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was what, like a hundred people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like a hundred people in that
alleyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys have ever seen
the comedy works alleyway, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably 30 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, about 10 yards less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just trying to give it a little
bit of a car and a person on either side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to say it's 10 feet
wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if a car goes down there,
we all got to squeeze against the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we'll say 10 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 15, but there was, there was like 75
to a hundred people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and it started feeling real
broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're outside in Colorado doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like, no, this is,
this isn't the attitude I want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: around weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of wasn't, it seemed like we were
taking tequila shots and everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: high fiving over the tequila shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I felt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that I didn't, I didn't stick
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Doug usually hangs out and
smokes with everybody, but he,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he smoked with a few people and then
he knows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he actually turned to me and he said,
Hey Ross, did Jeff, how are you,
[SPEAKER_00]: man?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how was your drive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he knows I drive far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the crowd saw him, heard him
address me, they fucking separated and let
[SPEAKER_00]: him and I kind of hang out and take some
pictures and chill for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shook my hand and left and just
wandered off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were still a lot of people there and
he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I saw, and go, and guy,
Oh, at that point, uh, and guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Belem, you guys, if you know,
and guy, Oh, check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at his name is a hard to spell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's N G A I O four 20 at NGO and guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check him out on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, um, he's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a jack of all trades, but he's
definitely a pot smoker and a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bumped into and guy, Oh, we've been
Twitter friends and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in the same area, same industry
for a long time, but I finally bumped into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dude and made friends with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he followed me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He followed our friend on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, I thought that was the end
of my meeting with and guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought we had met and shook hands
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody went our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint drove home, like he said,
cause he was tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously drew needed a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure Danielle got to her car safely
and we all headed back south to the lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Tuesday I had to drive almost all the
way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove up to the north end of Springs to
meet up with some friends for some food
[SPEAKER_00]: that were leaving back to Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got to introduce, um, our friend
Danielle to our friend, my friend Jay,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been Twitter and, uh, Instagram
friends for a long time and they finally
[SPEAKER_00]: got to meet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them two chicks in a parking lot,
let them hula hoop together for a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to make some friends out of those
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to them two ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Wednesday, Clint met me at my house,
uh, right around four 20 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we boogied up to go see um,
Mr. Greg proofs record the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: smartest podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may lose some of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys may like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Clint, I could tell that, uh,
Clint was a little bit lost during the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was either lost or it was just,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets a little ranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's, he calls that the
boring preachy part of his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good portion of his show
apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, uh, there was a lot of preachy
parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some joke parts at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just take a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got like a lot of references and
stuff that just, it just takes a while to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more of a, you know, let me hit you
with the left and a right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like his comedy, he's, he's doing,
uh, no, he's a smart guy and I like the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy and he's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the jokes he had were really
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes a little while to get there,
but he's, I'm pretty sure he's like
[SPEAKER_01]: improving all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that was so Wednesday was the
podcast Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing standup, which will be
completely different than what you saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing is like improv is a
different thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, I do standup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do improv and it's nothing against
improv.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't know those skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those guys are better, uh,
at many, many things, but I think just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to the joke and keeping people
laughing, that's where standup reigns and
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping you engaged and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now improv is kind of like, well,
let's try to figure out how do we get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to this like neutral points or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way we can make it funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those guys, that's a challenge and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the audience is a little bit more,
uh, gives you more leeway with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you guys know in the podcast
we're giving him more leeway than I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm, I'm not there just for the
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm expecting to be, um, enlightened a
little by Greg, educated, slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: offended at some points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know he's a thinking man's comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, and he calls himself the
world's smartest man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's, that's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a, but it's, he's a smart dude
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a smart sucker and he's been doing
improv.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you asked him how long you've been
doing comedy and he just shook his head at
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he just wanted to say like longer
than you've been alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was, but, but, uh, and, and I wasn't
trying to say it like, oh, how long you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been, I, I was just wanting to ask him
like, well, how long, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is, this is like a goal of mine to be
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and he kind of did kind of just
dismiss me as though I was saying it like
[SPEAKER_01]: an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I meant like was all respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dude, like I just, I just want to
know that there is the possibility that in
[SPEAKER_01]: like you've been doing this for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it takes to get to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, he's the one from whose line
is it anyway, his name of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose line is it anyway is one of the,
that's one of the shows that this guy is
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, uh, no offense to Greg, but he's
probably the one that you call the gay
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a beautiful wife named Jennifer
and he is completely straight and he
[SPEAKER_00]: stands up for women's rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just got like a little bit of a high,
uh, irritating voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't mean like super irritating,
but it's just like, I probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to marry that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm all right with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: His voice made it to where I didn't want
to marry him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing else about that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he wears a suit all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he had a suit with an, uh,
kind of a, uh, it's a bluish jacket with a
[SPEAKER_00]: purple shirt underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a purple hanky in one pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one point he pulled out a hanky out
of his jacket pocket to do a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hanky out of his pocket was
perfectly pressed and it was purple and it
[SPEAKER_00]: had gold pinstriping on it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: His pocket hanky was fucking stylish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this dude is stylish from head to
toe.
[SPEAKER_00]: His shoes were sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that shocked me about the
man was, uh, so we saw the comp,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw him record his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: While he's recording the show,
I looked to the right and I see Engayo
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting backstage at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, we're going to hang out
with Engayo and Greg, watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the show, uh, we get bustled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, after a couple of times of me
looking over at Clint and he's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: like he's going to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to our friend Joe,
our friend Joe met up with us and joined
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we almost left Joe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe joined us for the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe was a huge proofs fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I looked over and Greg's kind of,
or, uh, Clint's kind of fallen asleep a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the show we're looking for
the guys and we can't find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend of mine is like, dude,
they're down here in this area smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: just walk back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked back there and I could hear
Engayo from a block away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a very recognizable voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we walked down the stairs and they're
just hanging out smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Engayo greets me and knew my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I introduced myself to Greg
proofs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sticks out his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shake hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked if we're interrupting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, no, I lit a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just what I felt like needed to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we started hanging out with these
guys for, we hung out for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I was going to say,
what I led onto was the thing that shocked
[SPEAKER_00]: me about Greg, he smokes cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never would have guessed Greg proofs
smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have thought that he was smarter
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing against you cigarette smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I have just recently finally got,
I quit my e-cig too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit all that nicotine shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing weed now, which,
you know, hit and miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a good thing or a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's better for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's better for me, but it could
also give me fire for my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's name is not Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bobby McGee here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Bob McGee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, um, no, I understand cutting
cigarettes out is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but Greg proofs doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it was like, wow, that's that,
that was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it stunk too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of, it was so weird that like,
I could smell his cigarette worse than I
[SPEAKER_01]: could smell all the dankness around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Engyo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pulled out some Tangy from Cali that
had some stink and some flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Tangy was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get the chance to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smelt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already too high by the time he had
pulled that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smelt it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my Platin emoji, uh, trumped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platin emoji.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, I gave him the last of my Platin
emoji that I had with me and he looked
[SPEAKER_00]: quite impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, uh, he was, and he was a nice guy
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Engyo is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked with these guys for like an hour
and they were talking to us, not at us,
[SPEAKER_00]: not about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were just hanging out with normal
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, Greg proofs was telling a
baseball story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about proofs,
you know, he's a huge baseball fan and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking about a player leading off of
first plate base in a celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the umpire yelled play ball and
the guy just stayed way off of first plate
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first baseman reaches over with
the ball and tags him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as he talks about tagging him out,
he damn near punched me in the titty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause he tagged me out as like a
physical act to show what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was being cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he was just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that story was, uh, the Kansas city
Royal's own George Brett for all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, stoner fucking baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the story you were that we were
being told.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000th hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was celebrating his 3000th hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so when proofs was acting out the
smack, he smacked me and looked at me like
[SPEAKER_00]: I was his buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried not to light up like a school
girl because I was stupid excited,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I thought it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg proofs is one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, I'm a comedy nerd and he's a comedy
legend and I'm a podcaster and he's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, something about, and he's
articulate and, uh, he makes me speak and
[SPEAKER_00]: write better.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually makes me more conscious of my
vocabulary and my mouth when I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I'm not super dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, uh, he was really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was some really funny
parts to Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two though, you know, but you know,
between the shows, I had a rough weekend
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was going to say, you know,
but Graham Elliott, that was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elwood, Elwood, Graham, Elwood,
Graham, Elwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, yes, just like you said,
it wasn't recorded or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nobody will also hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, uh, Graham, Graham was my favorite
of the, the little excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is kind of owed a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got comedy blue balls right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd assume it's fucking a little comedy
tug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 10th will be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe when Guy will come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be cool to see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know who was going to be on
that, but I'm going to have my tag or my
[SPEAKER_01]: name tag ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know if I want to take my old,
I've got a name tag made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if you don't know what we're talking
about, when you go see Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_00]: do Doug loves movies, Doug loves movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take a name tag with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I want to take my old name
tag or if I want to print up a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just take your old one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]: And that's June.
[SPEAKER_00]: In June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what else do we have coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: A Brian Callan show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sounds like I'm going to see
Brian Callan, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to start listening to more Brian
Callan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about, well, you know,
I'm all about seeing some Brian Callan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, that's a fighter in the kid,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, it's, it's going to be fun,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing is it's just fun going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the thing is like,
I'm not going to complain about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: like these couple of days, cause they were
fun days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's funny that I can still be a
little bit like, uh, it wasn't that great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we hung out with Proops and Nungayo
for a fucking hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an hour and just smoked like bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the hell I'm
complaining about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could have probably smoked with
Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't feel like hopping in that
crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a big crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to see Doug here in like
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother's day, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we mentioned the mother's days?
[SPEAKER_00]: How high are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that opener?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold open fucking from Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got anything else you want to add
about the, uh, the comedy shows before we
[SPEAKER_00]: start wrapping it up and moving on to
different subjects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the again, uh, comedy works is one of
the best clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you haven't been there,
please go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter who you go see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, we have great service there all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got waitresses running all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and with us, you know, we're doing,
uh, every Thursday down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to see open mic comedy,
we're still doing that every Thursday at
[SPEAKER_00]: the rainbow, at the rainbow on Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, I know I keep talking about
being VIP at comedy works and they treat
[SPEAKER_00]: me like a pimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will treat you like a pimp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat everybody like a rock star
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm just six five with dreadlocks and
they recognize my high ass every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they remember me and I've made friends
and we're coming back kind of frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bring dank, dank weed and I might
smoke out in the back every time and they
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might smell you coming before they
see your fucking six five Ross to fucking
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's fun when you take,
uh, take a date with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's never really hung out with you out
in public a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take her to a comedy show and
everybody at the comedy works 125 miles
[SPEAKER_00]: from your house, high fives you and knows
you by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedians know you by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way to take a chick out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty neat, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I do want to go to the cannabis cup
with you next year though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you do because,
uh, Oh, I ain't smoking a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just saying every 10 feet,
it's, uh, I get stopped and start a new
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation every 10 feet, every 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, put a bag over your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw some dreadlocks on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll think that I am you because we're
about the same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are close to the same height,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be my brother, brother from
another work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just, I'll just, uh, kind of be
like, yeah, man, like, uh, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just really high and I just won't even
open my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have sunglasses anyway,
if you're being me.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, here we go, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need an I region X shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send around a drone of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I can go kick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still, he's still running around just
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on and off on ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be me for five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the morning shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no people out there in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of people out there in the
mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy this, this time in the
mornings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess you said that on the last
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you talked about it on the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just how busy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never looked for the official ticket
sales to see how many people were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people that I know I'm good on
that one, but thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are people that I did not get to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just tried to pass me a bowl of flowers
and I turned it down because flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: really give me stupid bad cotton mouth on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a dab though.

[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy and uh, he's, he wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw his post about doing a, some show
where he's hosting it.

[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's going up to Longmont to host
some, I don't remember who it was either.

Thursdays at the rainbow?

can do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish more ladies had come out.

together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the social media takes a lot of your
damn time.

catch myself like, Oh, I've been on here
[SPEAKER_00]: for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to wipe and get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see that coming.

sometimes you got to cut loose and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy show.

of weed anyway.
