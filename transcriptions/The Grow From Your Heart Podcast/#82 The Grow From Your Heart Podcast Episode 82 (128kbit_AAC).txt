[SPEAKER_00]: Hope nobody had a major hangover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everything went well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the 5th of July, I'm going to brag a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see, who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would you guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see Mr. Doug Benson at
ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug was in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did another standup comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, he really redeemed
himself from the last show that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to this podcast regularly,
you know that I kind of bashed Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson's last performance at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also kind of bashed his album.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a much better performance this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a little bit of a cough,
which may have worked to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug wasn't smoking as heavily because he
was a little bit under the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it led to him having a better
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug did make a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Doug walked out on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing Doug said was,
hey, you know, it's a Doug Benson show
[SPEAKER_00]: because Rasta Jeff is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I was sitting right in the
front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got those two VIP seats always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he started talking a little bit
and he pulled out a handful of notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, well, I got my jokes here in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked me straight in the face and
he said, Rasta Jeff knows what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys listen to this podcast,
I called Doug out on his pocket full of
[SPEAKER_00]: disheveled notes on another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am wondering if Doug listens to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, but Doug, if you're
listening, dude, great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're getting over that cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been watching your Periscope
videos and they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at ComedyWorks that weekend,
or the same day, opening for Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_00]: was my friend Engaio Belem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know Engaio Belem,
make sure you check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is spelled N-G-A-I-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Engaio420 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you search him out and follow
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cannabis connoisseur like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of things to talk about
and we may hint at a future collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk too much about it, but there
may be some stuff being talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does live in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to deal with
there, but we are going to try and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say Engaio crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engaio did probably 20 minutes,
maybe 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like he went on for a long time,
but he definitely tore it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to be 15 or 20 minutes because I'm
sure he didn't do more than that being an
[SPEAKER_00]: opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me laugh my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson was equally hilarious,
but I've seen Doug so many times that when
[SPEAKER_00]: he starts into a vibe, I know which jokes
are coming out of this clump of like this
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the show is going to be this clump
of jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vibe will change because he's
very interactive with the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of crowd work, but I know
all of Doug's jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little predictable for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go for the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go for the smoke session before and
after, of course, because that's always a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enough bragging about my weekend at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to Mr. Doug Benson,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Engaio Beelum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big, huge shout out to ComedyWorks,
the greatest comedy venue on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always gets me the hookups at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a big shout out to my beautiful
date, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a wonderful date.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to going to more comedy
shows with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I might sneeze here in a
minute, but we're just going to push on
[SPEAKER_00]: through until that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get into a little bit of
news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I woke up the other day and I got
on the internet here and I see my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddyup's face plastered all over the damn
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Giddyup
and Too Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been, if you guys follow the show,
you've been hearing about the raid that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in Santa Ana, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager of that dispensary was in a
wheelchair and she was blind and she has
[SPEAKER_00]: an amputated leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been getting a lot of media
coverage and recently it was discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: that her wheelchair was, her electric
wheelchair was kind of falling apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was held together mainly by duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there were a couple of people that
thought that a lady in her position
[SPEAKER_00]: deserved better than a duct tape
wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Giddyup from Emotech and Too Short got
together and bought this lovely lady a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big, huge personal
shout out to Giddyup and to Too Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That represents two industries that are
always looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rap industry has always looked at like
a bunch of gangsters and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has looked at like a bunch of
drug dealers, but look what two of our
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives did.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I read, that wheelchair was
about $4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not pocket change for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good deed done by our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out to Giddyup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to Giddyup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddy actually sent me my Gmail that I use
and there's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do whatever you can to support Emotech,
send them a thank you, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another news article
on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to decide which one I want to
read first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both, let's see, let's go to this
one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I was just browsing through news
sites and I came across this and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that the world would like to hear about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, do medical marijuana
users have right to bear arms?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, says the ATF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says there are no exceptions
in federal law for marijuana purportedly
[SPEAKER_00]: used for medicinal purposes, ATF official
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by Matt Voltz and it's
from the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this, it's from Helena,
Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says firearms dealers in states that
allow medical marijuana can't sell guns or
[SPEAKER_00]: ammunition to registered users of the
drug, a policy that marijuana and gun
[SPEAKER_00]: rights groups say deny second amendment
rights to individuals who are following
[SPEAKER_00]: state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law already makes it illegal for
someone to possess a gun if he or she is
[SPEAKER_00]: an unlawful user of or addicted to
marijuana or other controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: A September 21st letter from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
[SPEAKER_00]: Explosives issued in response to numerous
inquiries from gun dealers clarifies that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana patients are included in
that definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no exceptions in federal law for
marijuana purportedly used for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes even if such use is sanctioned by
state law, said the letter by Arthur
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbert, the ATF's assistant director for
enforcement programs and services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal firearms licensees or FFLs can't
sell a gun to someone who answers yes when
[SPEAKER_00]: requested forms asked whether the buyer is
a controlled substance user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a tricky, that's
bullshit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna keep reading on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasonable cause to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's letter also says that licensed
dealers can't sell a gun or ammunition if
[SPEAKER_00]: they have reasonable cause to believe the
buyer is using a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes if the buyer presents a
medical marijuana card as identification
[SPEAKER_00]: or if the buyer talks about drug use,
having a medical marijuana card or a
[SPEAKER_00]: recent drug conviction, ATF spokesman Drew
Wade said Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are no new obligations for gun
dealers outlined in the letter,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wade said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We received lots of queries from the
industry from various states of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the state legislation and
federal law, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our responsibility to provide
guidance, advice and guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clash between state and federal laws
has led to lawsuits and criminal cases in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the 16 states that have legalized
medical marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials in two Oregon counties have said
they'll appeal to US Supreme Court after
[SPEAKER_00]: state judges said sheriffs couldn't deny
concealed handgun licenses for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Court of Appeals and the Oregon
Supreme Court said the state law
[SPEAKER_00]: authorizes concealed handgun permits and
separate from the federal law that outlaws
[SPEAKER_00]: gun possession by drug users and the state
gun law doesn't address medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm reading ahead of myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Montana Raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal authorities also raided dozens of
medical marijuana operations across
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana this spring, chilling a once
booming pot industry and leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeping changes in Montana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Justice followed up with
a warning letter to political leaders in
[SPEAKER_00]: many states that federal prosecutors will
pursue marijuana distributors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not individual patients who are
following state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter the ATF sent to gun dealers
last week was first reported by Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: newspapers of Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl marijuana and gun groups said the
policy clarification amounts to rescinding
[SPEAKER_00]: the gun rights for the thousands of people
licensed to use medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears to contradict the 2009
Department of Justice memo that said Obama
[SPEAKER_00]: administration would not pursue
prosecution of individual medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana users who obey state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beside that, the government is putting an
additional burden on gun dealers to police
[SPEAKER_00]: their customers, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said Montana Shooting Sports Association,
Gary Marba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their business is to be merchants,
not to be cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the federal licensing
scheme complicates that, Marba said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds as if the ATF is expecting them
to drift further into that cop role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine that, you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that if you're a gun seller,
you don't have to just follow that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have to like talk to
everybody and try to act like you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are gonna be a bunch of
vigilantes that are gonna see somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I bet if I went into a gun store,
they would deny me a sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I never figured out this question
or filled out this questionnaire,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd say you're a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot buy a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is now up to, vaguely up to the
store owner or the salesperson,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep reading the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protecting America from Criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wade said both the 2009 memo and last
week's letter were approved by the Justice
[SPEAKER_00]: Department and he does not believe there
is a contradiction in the two messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also that the dealers are in good
position to help prevent firearms from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must have omitted a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say he also said that the
dealers are in a good position to help
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent firearms from getting into the
wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FFLs aren't cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are at the front line of protecting
America from criminals or people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited from possessing firearms,
Wade said.
[SPEAKER_00]: A salesman at once licensed firearms
dealer, Montana Outdoor Sports and Helena
[SPEAKER_00]: said he doesn't expect much to change as a
result of the letter because it's largely
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the buyer to reveal whether he or
she is a medical marijuana user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to say yes to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Asked Damon Peters, a sales associate for
the store and a licensed hunting guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of users of medical marijuana aren't
really shooting sports enthusiasts anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we may see a sailor too lost,
but I don't see anything dramatic that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to affect us, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of talk about guns going
on in our country lately and I support
[SPEAKER_00]: guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they took away all the guns,
the only people that would have guns would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the bad guys, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the way that works,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the guns were illegal, the criminals
aren't going to care that the guns are
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be like, oh,
here's my guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit of a theory, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what's happening is if you're a
medical marijuana patient, you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to purchase a firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of shit is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because, so here's another side of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be a Vicodin patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be a Valium patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be maybe some sort of
anti-depressant user, patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you call the person that's taking
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm able to buy a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take my Vicodin, my Ritalin,
my Valium, my Ambien, and what else could
[SPEAKER_00]: I take possibly to go with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: My Celebrex and my Vicodin, and then a
Boner pill, because everybody's got to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a Boner pill, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take all of those and then I could
go buy a gun, but I can't use my medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to ease my pain a little bit or
help my appetite and then purchase a
[SPEAKER_00]: firearm to either protect my home or hunt
for food or just have it because I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: good old American and I should have a damn
gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a ridiculous law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that everybody should be made
aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what we can do about it,
but I thought it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are kind of right though about the
people that smoke medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: not wanting to be hunters and shooters,
but this is Colorado and you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised the diversity of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends who have dreadlocks who
snowboard on the one weekend and who will
[SPEAKER_00]: go elk hunting the next weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be wrong with their assumptions
on who is hunting and who is using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much in this article that we
could bitch about, but instead,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's move on to a little bit more of a
positive note.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from the Washington
Post and it is written by a guy named
[SPEAKER_00]: Radley Balko and the headline is,
since marijuana legalization, highway
[SPEAKER_00]: fatalities in Colorado are at a near
historic low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, let me read this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, since Colorado voters legalized
pot in 2012, prohibition supporters have
[SPEAKER_00]: warned that recreational marijuana will
lead to a scourge of drugged drivers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the state's roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often point out that when the state
legalized medical marijuana in 2001,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a surge in drivers found to have
smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also point to studies showing that in
other states that have legalized pot for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal purposes, we've seen an increase
in the number of drivers testing positive
[SPEAKER_00]: for the drug who were involved in fatal
car accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anti-pot group, SAM, recently pointed
out that even before the first legal pot
[SPEAKER_00]: store opened in Washington state,
the number of drivers in that state
[SPEAKER_00]: testing positive for pot jumped by a
third.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with these criticisms is that
we can test only for the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana metabolites, not for
inebriation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metabolites can linger in the body for
days after the drug's effects wear off,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes even for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to chime in myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very heavy cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, this had to be nearly 10
years ago, I was trying to get a good job
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have paid very well and had
some great benefits, and so I quit smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I had to do is pass one drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this place did was one pre-hire
screening, and then I would have been home
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have worked there forever and
never had to pee test again unless I hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, in which case I would have just
walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went 30 days and I took a voluntary pee
test that you can buy at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went 45 days and took a pee test and I
was still dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went 60 days and I took a pee test and I
was still dirty, but I already had my
[SPEAKER_00]: interview scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 63 days in, I went and took a pee test,
and the doctor called me back and told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that I still had more than 1,400 nanograms
per whatever their measurement was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more than their limit of THC in my
urine after 63 days, and he asked me if I
[SPEAKER_00]: was taking prescription Marinol or what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him that I hadn't smoked in nine
weeks and he was a little bit blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're saying that metabolites can
linger in the body for days, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: even weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went nine weeks and there was still
cannabis in my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you that on day 64,
I took a fat bong hit and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever been that fucking high in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to continue on with
the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, because we all metabolize drugs
differently and at different times and
[SPEAKER_00]: under different conditions, all that
positive test tells us is that the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: driver has smoked pot at some point in the
past few days or weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense that loosening restrictions
on pot would result in a higher percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of drivers involved in fatal traffic
accidents having smoked the drug at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point over the past few days or weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd also expect to find that a higher
percentage of church growers, good
[SPEAKER_00]: Samaritans and soup kitchen volunteers
would have pot in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd expect a similar result among any
large sampling of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't necessarily mean that
marijuana caused or was even a
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing factor to accidents,
traffic violations or fatalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't an argument that pot wasn't a
factor in at least some of those accidents
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's precisely the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A post accident test for marijuana
metabolites doesn't tell us much about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether pot contributed to the accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the new Colorado law took effect in
January, the drug driver panic has only
[SPEAKER_00]: intensified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already written about one dubious
example in which the Colorado Highway
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrol and some local and had some local
and national media perpetuated a story
[SPEAKER_00]: that a driver was high on pot when he
slammed into a couple of police cars
[SPEAKER_00]: parked on an interstate exit ramp.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the driver did have some pot in his
system, his blood alcohol level was off
[SPEAKER_00]: the charts and was far more likely the
cause of the accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we've seen a few
times here, that people will be on other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, they'll be drunk and they'll get in
an accident and they'll have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis in their system and they blame
that shit on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they overlook the fact that this guy
was on four hits of acid, that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: tweaking his brains out, that he had
mushrooms in his brain, but he smoked a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that had to have been what sent him
over the edge and made him crash his car.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna go a little bit
more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my colleague Mark Fisher's recent
dispatch from Colorado, law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: officials there and in bordering states
warned that they're seeing more drug
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress recently held hearings on the
matter, complete with dire predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: such as we're going to have a lot more
people stoned on the highway and there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be consequences from Rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Micah of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have called for a zero tolerance
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're driving with any trace of pot in
your system, you're guilty of a DWI.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would effectively ban anyone who
smokes pot from driving up to a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after the last joint, including
people who legitimately use the drug for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, that means that I would never be
able to drive again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what that shit says.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says that any medical cannabis user
in Colorado would not be able to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess now you can't drive or have a
gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the two articles that I've read today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police state much with a question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna read more of the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that the best way to gauge
the effect legalization has had on the
[SPEAKER_00]: roadways is to look at what happened on
the road since legalization took effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a month by month comparison of
highway fatalities in Colorado through the
[SPEAKER_00]: first seven months of this year and last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more thorough comparison, I've also
included the highest fatality figures for
[SPEAKER_00]: each month since 2002, the lowest for each
month since 2002 and the average for each
[SPEAKER_00]: month since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a graph here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know graphs don't do you any good on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're gonna look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are showing, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are one, two, three, four,
five lines on this graph, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it is showing you that shit
has gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, as you can see, roadway
fatalities this year are down from last
[SPEAKER_00]: year and down from the 13 year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the seven months so far this year,
five months saw a lower fatality figure
[SPEAKER_00]: than the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two months saw a slightly higher figure
this year and in one month, the two
[SPEAKER_00]: figures were equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add up the total fatalities from
January through July, it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna see, it's a down sloping
graph, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take my word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a down sloping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts high and it goes low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll read the rest of the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, here are the high bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, pardon the pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high bar is what you get when you add
the worst January since 2002 to the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: February to the worst March and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The low bar is the sum total of the safest
January, February, et cetera, since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's notable here is that the total so
far in 2014 are closer to the safest
[SPEAKER_00]: composite year since 2002 than to the
average year since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also add here that these are
total fatalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to calculate these figures as a
rate, say miles driven per fatality,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drop would be starker, both for this
year and since Colorado legalized medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the number of miles Americans drive
annually has leveled off nationally since
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid 2000s, the number of total miles
traveled continues to go up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to measure by rate, then the
state would be at lows unseen in decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're driving even more is what he's
saying and we are crashing even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The figures are similar in states that
have legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: While some studies have shown that the
number of drivers involved in fatal
[SPEAKER_00]: collisions who test positive for marijuana
had steadily increased as pot has become
[SPEAKER_00]: more available, other studies have shown
that overall traffic fatalities in those
[SPEAKER_00]: states have dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because the pot tests only measure
for recent pot use, not inebriation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing inconsistent about those
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the continuing drop in roadway
fatalities in Colorado and elsewhere is
[SPEAKER_00]: due to a variety of factors such as better
built cars and trucks, improved safety
[SPEAKER_00]: features and better road engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These features in and of themselves only
indicate that the roads are getting safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't suggest that pot testing had
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only seven months in, maybe these
figures will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, it's also possible that if it
weren't for a legal pot, the 2014 figures
[SPEAKER_00]: would be even lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real way to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only look at the data available,
but you can bet that if fatalities were up
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, prohibition supporters would be
blaming it on legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, though road fatalities have
generally been falling in Colorado for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, 2013 actually saw a slight
decrease from 2012 so fatalities are down
[SPEAKER_00]: the year after legalization, after having
gone up the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, some researchers have
gone so far as to suggest that better
[SPEAKER_00]: access to pot is making the roads safer,
at least marginally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory is that people are substituting
pot for alcohol and pot causes less driver
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment than booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see more studies before I'd be
ready to endorse that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's also some research
contradicting the theory that drinkers are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to substitute pot for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit drinking completely when I got my
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said to myself, I'm able to go to the
store and buy cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could buy all the herb I want,
because before you'd have to wait for your
[SPEAKER_00]: dude to have some, or you'd have to grow
your own, or you'd have to wait for your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to be ready, or you'd hope one of
your bros had a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got my medical marijuana card
and I could just smoke down and then go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and buy some more and then smoke
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I ran out and just go to the
store tomorrow, I didn't even need to
[SPEAKER_00]: drink anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit drinking, I haven't had alcohol in
so many years, and now I smoke all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to drink when I can smoke
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but the data are far more
supportive of that than the claims that
[SPEAKER_00]: stone drivers are menacing Colorado's
roadways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, clarification,
I wrote that we can test only for the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of marijuana metabolites,
not for inebriation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does go on to say, this is true of
roadside tests, but a blood test taken at
[SPEAKER_00]: a hospital can measure for THC,
the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he said ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to change that to compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crossing it out on the keyboard screen
or on the computer screen or writing
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, even here, there are
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular users can still have remnant THC
in their blood well after the effects have
[SPEAKER_00]: worn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular users can also have levels above
the legal limit and still drive perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, a THC level of five nanograms
or more brings a presumptive charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: driving under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, references to marijuana related
accidents in studies by prohibitionists
[SPEAKER_00]: and law enforcement could refer to any
measure or trace of the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when officials and legalization
opponents talk about increases in these
[SPEAKER_00]: figures, it still isn't clear what any of
this means for road safety, because I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a quick drink, excuse me,
for one minute, and then we will talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my throat is back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting dry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we have legalized cannabis,
the traffic has been safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get drunk, you drive recklessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blacked out and you're just driving
and getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care what lane you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care what direction you're
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't even know where the
hell you're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're high, you're just calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look twice and you go a little bit
under the speed limit because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to cruise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put the music at a comfortable
level and you want to watch everything
[SPEAKER_00]: come at you at a decent pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never get too crazy when I'm
driving high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit that when I was a youngster,
I would drive a little bit drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was some scary shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never been scared of myself driving
high, but I have scared the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: myself driving too drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll never happen again because I don't
drink alcohol so I can talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's see how far
into this show we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're already 27 minutes in.
