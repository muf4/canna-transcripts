[SPEAKER_00]: I really do think that covers all of the

[SPEAKER_00]: show Let's work our way into the question
and answer portion of today's podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's grow questions came from the grow
help tab on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics comm That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics comm On the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list of tabs One of those tabs
does say grow help if you click on that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow help tab We give you the opportunity
to ask us a grow question Send me a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question through that grow help tab If I
read your question here on the podcast You
[SPEAKER_00]: will win a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds from iry direct comm Today's first
[SPEAKER_00]: question came from our new friend John
shout out to my buddy John The question
[SPEAKER_00]: says I was wondering if the free seeds you
get with your order are tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a cool idea and something I
would be into my lemon Jeffrey just hit
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail today and I'm so freaking
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man So this is a great question
Speaking of the sale at iry direct if you
[SPEAKER_00]: spend thirty dollars or more at iry direct
comm you will get a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a two pack of 4k if you spend a
hundred dollars You will also get a free
[SPEAKER_00]: two pack of cherry goat feminized seeds
the 4k or fems also This listener is
[SPEAKER_00]: asking if those free seeds are testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those seeds have been thoroughly
tested those seeds are part of the Irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics premium seed lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been thoroughly tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pass testing their quality seeds I
could sell them if I chose to sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll notice right now the 4k is a
freebie the 4k is also available in a six
[SPEAKER_00]: pack if you wanted to purchase that
Sometimes I choose the freebies based on
[SPEAKER_00]: my inventory based on demand I actually
happen to have a whole bunch of those 4k
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds So those ended up being the freebie
for a little while here I've got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: limited number of the cherry goat and
instead of trying to break those into
[SPEAKER_00]: packs and sell those As packs I just made
them the freebie So if you spend a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks you do get the cherry goat freebie
But the question is are those tester seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or have they been tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are thoroughly tested if I'm
giving out a tester seed It does clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: say tester seed on the website on the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make that very very very clear I like
to give out the testers with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: pamphlet They come with a little card that
has sort of a an information a little
[SPEAKER_00]: piece on there and kind of what I would
expect from those tester seeds It's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: link to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a link to the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you what I have I hope you would
do with those testers gives you the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing criteria and welcomes you to the
testing team So if you get testers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are clearly marked as testers now And
many people have been asking how they
[SPEAKER_00]: become testers for irie genetics I've made
it very easy at the first of every month
[SPEAKER_00]: usually around the first of every month We
will be late in June because I will be
[SPEAKER_00]: away at the dude grows cup But most of the
time around the first of every month I do
[SPEAKER_00]: add new testers to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those testers are at a reduced price.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go up on the website There's usually
between 30 and 60 packs of testers
[SPEAKER_00]: available It just depends on how I decide
to do it how much testing I've done how
[SPEAKER_00]: much testing I want you guys to do but
generally At the first of every month I do
[SPEAKER_00]: add packs of tester seeds to irie direct
and those are available for purchase I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done a full talk about why I make people
purchase those but I feel like I get more
[SPEAKER_00]: more feedback more results people They do
more work if I charge them for those
[SPEAKER_00]: tester seeds So the testers will be
available around the first of every month
[SPEAKER_00]: I do put up new testers in the month of
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do something very unique with
my testers I'm going to put up two
[SPEAKER_00]: different testers I used the same pollen
donor on these testers But I use two
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes of the pollen
receiver and I'm not sure which one I like
[SPEAKER_00]: better So I'm going to offer both packs as
a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's number one and number three They will
both be available as testers for the month
[SPEAKER_00]: of June I'm going to try to figure out a
way to give you a discount if you buy both
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you can run both packs at the
same time And then we can see a phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: number one or phenotype number three is
the cut that we should put to market So
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it that way in the month
of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be two testers available It's
basically phenotype number one and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype number three you guys get to
test those right along with us My crew is
[SPEAKER_00]: testing them too And then we can decide
which works best in your gardens and those
[SPEAKER_00]: will be what are released and put out to
market So thank you for helping with the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and that is how you acquire the
test seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at irie direct comm make sure you
check Around the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will restock occasionally I will go
to patreon and make a post that says hey
[SPEAKER_00]: the next ten people to use coupon code
Whatever can get a free tester pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds at irie direct So join that patreon
and increase your chances of a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy John I really think I
answered this question Those freebies are
[SPEAKER_00]: not testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are tested and reliable seeds Yes
offering those tester seeds for a small
[SPEAKER_00]: retail price is definitely improved and
increased the amount of communication
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from those Testers he wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my lemon Jeffrey just hit the mail
today and I'm so freaking excited and my
[SPEAKER_00]: new friend John I do hope to see pictures
of the progress when you grow those lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey seeds You can send those photos to
me at irie genetics at hotmail.com Or you
[SPEAKER_00]: can join the discord and post those photos
in the lemon Jeffrey tab on the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: server Let me get off on a tangent here
and talk about discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not on the notes anywhere This is
just a random thought and idea a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people have messaged me saying that
discord is not Very easy to use that they
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot figure out the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My discord server is overwhelming discord
itself is a little bit overwhelming If you
[SPEAKER_00]: are new once you figure it out once you
poke around a little while it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple to use When you click on the irie
army discord, you'll be in the irie army
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a row of tabs on the left I'm not
looking at the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't remember the tabs, but it's
like irie genetics testers general chat
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of different on the left
is just a bunch of different tabs all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those different tabs Are basically
categories that you could click on to and
[SPEAKER_00]: read and join and see the chat that's
already going on So everything on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: is a header if you click on general chat,
you'll click on that It will open up
[SPEAKER_00]: another box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the general chat You could chat
about anything in there people are in
[SPEAKER_00]: there talking about their dogs Talking
about their cars talking about life a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people are in there talking about
growing ganja Many people are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the dude grows cup, but that is the
general chat You could post pictures you
[SPEAKER_00]: could talk about your dogs your life your
cars anything you want over there In the
[SPEAKER_00]: general chat, you'll notice there are a
bunch of tabs on the side and they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit self-explanatory Once you
figure it out There's one that says irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics tester tab If you click on that
tester tab You can see all of the progress
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of the other people who are posting
pictures of their tester plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you and invite you to post your
tester photos there Also, like my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: John he's growing going to be growing
lemon Jeffrey If you scroll way far down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that every single strain well
most of them that we've been able to Add
[SPEAKER_00]: so far that an admin or myself have had
the foresight or the thought to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: that tab If you scroll down almost every
strain will be listed There's a tab for a
[SPEAKER_00]: rise blueberry butcher black cherry cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all listed in alphabetical order
There's regs and fems two different
[SPEAKER_00]: categories but if you find a strain that
you are interested in you can click on
[SPEAKER_00]: that strain name and it will open up that
Category and you can see other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with that plant other people
that have grown lemon Jeffrey have posted
[SPEAKER_00]: in that tab There's photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's grow advice if you have questions
About growing lemon Jeffrey go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: type it right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this look right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hey, do I have a deficiency or does
this plant look this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it should or did I screw up you
can post all kinds of photos comments
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and people in the discord will
help you out Most of the people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord are quite knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong There's weird-ass
apples in every bunch But most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people on discord will be able to help you
out and give you Solid useful reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: advice that will help you with your grow
and most of those people are Growing my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not just giving you made-up
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've ran those plants before they know
what to expect Most of them have been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for quite a while So I encourage
you to join the discord server and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left just those tabs Everything it says is
just a it is what that tab says the
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers lounge If you click in the smokers
lounge, you can come join us and hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: and chat in the smokers lounge I'm there
taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool people in there a
lot of times of the day There's kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon crew a night crew come hang out
You're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to get on the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave your camera off and join the
chat You could just listen until you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable to say something a lot of
people find me on the discord server in
[SPEAKER_00]: the evening If you've got a direct
question you want to get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place to pin me down and find
me I'm in there taking dabs come in ask me
[SPEAKER_00]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to answer But the discord
shouldn't be too hard to navigate if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just realize all those tabs on the left
are just the different Categories that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens up that category You can read
that if you want to contribute go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and post a picture or go ahead and post
your comments your stories If you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: post a picture, there's a little tab with
the plus sign on it click on the plus sign
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you the opportunity to add
photos videos or attachments I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys know how to work the internet at that
point My point is that discord server
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't as overwhelming as it looks There
are just a lot of tabs and it looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to look at once you start clicking
around and navigate and get comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same thing over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right that is My ramble about my
discord server my buddy John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question Please do
check your inbox because you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of iri
genetics Premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this party moving I've got
another great question here in front of me
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my new friend Teo shout
out to my buddy Teo This question also
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the grow help tab on iri
genetics comm which means Teo I owe you a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
iri direct comm so make sure you check
[SPEAKER_00]: your email Check your spam because by the
time this episode comes out, you will have
[SPEAKER_00]: that coupon code Enjoy those free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey tail Nice to meet you buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I hope you are doing well I'm
great, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm highest giraffe pussy and I'm hanging
out with you guys I have nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: complain about it says being a perpetual
grower Is there any benefit to completely
[SPEAKER_00]: resetting after a run by this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean let your current plants finish
Without starting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything to gain by doing this
that you cannot gain without doing a full?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reset this is a very very good question So
our friend is running a perpetual grow
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they've always got plants
coming in and always got plants going out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that grow They've established a routine
and a rotation and a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know their routine rotation or
schedule So i'm going to hypothetically
[SPEAKER_00]: make it up Let's just say that every two
weeks they are harvesting a plant and to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace that harvested plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving a new plant Right into that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every two weeks they've got a harvest
They cut down one plant move another plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in cut down one plant move another plant
in So by doing that you're always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have plants in different stages of flower
You'll have plants in beginning of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of weeks in four weeks six weeks
eight weeks into flower You'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's just about ready to harvest
Now the main idea of a perpetual grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a rhythm and harvest on a
schedule perpetually Now I don't know this
[SPEAKER_00]: person's schedule routine or rhythm but
i'm going to hypothetically say that every
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks This person is able to harvest a
plant and as soon as that plant is chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: down They drag in another plant just to
fill that space and then every two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that process Now if they get this
going successfully that means that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: always got a plant in week one week three
week five week seven and week nine and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they can harvest a week nine a lot of
times they're going to go week 10 or week
[SPEAKER_00]: eight just to keep the rhythm on track,
but if they get this successfully on
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythm They're always going to have plants
at different stages of the grow now That
[SPEAKER_00]: is a perpetual grow one in one out or a
certain amount in a certain amount out
[SPEAKER_00]: every week on a rhythm I don't know how
many this could be one plant at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a thousand plants at a time
as long as the rhythm works You're
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetually harvesting plants a lot of
people like to fill the room run it all at
[SPEAKER_00]: once and chop everything down all at one
time That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of reward all at once But
it's a pain in the ass to harvest dry trim
[SPEAKER_00]: cure that much weed all at one time So for
some people the perpetual is the way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: you can supply exactly How much medicine
you need that way you're not overloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: with the big trim job You're always just
trimming a little bit instead of a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch at one time And then some gets too
dry some gets messed up if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetually doing it You can set your own
rhythm and have the medicine as you need
[SPEAKER_00]: it So the main question here is am I
missing any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Opportunities by staying perpetual and not
shutting down for a certain amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: after a full harvest The only things I can
really think of and I made a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: notes here would be a huge clean and reset
and With the foresight to send this
[SPEAKER_00]: question I would imagine that you are
doing a good clean and reset in that room
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like to do when I harvest an
entire room is I clean that entire room
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ceiling to the floor 100% I will
clean the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the light bulbs out put new
bulbs in there We clean the lights we
[SPEAKER_00]: clean all the filters the fans everything
gets super clean the reason I like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that when the room is empty is because
then I can get step stools and ladders in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I can get Up on top of things
and clean without worrying about
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying breaking damaging any of the
plants dropping something on the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking a branch Also getting all the
dust from the lights and the fans and the
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers I don't want to wipe that off of
the fan or off of the blower and have it
[SPEAKER_00]: land into my canopy So that's a big part
of why I like to do the full breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: reset and start over but honestly that is
the only major advantage to finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything all at once maybe Maybe once
every once a year once every six months
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe consider Stopping the perpetual
cycle and just having a bunch of stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg ready to go do that full clean and
then start over because sometimes I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to spray phyzan or Maybe h202 or something
like that in the room just to clean it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and sanitize everything really well just
to prevent problems because Sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: problems just arise and if you're doing
preventative things every so often you
[SPEAKER_00]: won't have problems as likely Let me get
back to my notes What about some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: corners and the spaces that you can't get
to when the room is full?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that one corner in the grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there's something floating like a
little piece of debris I'm not tripping
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys there is some shit flying through
my there's two of them flying through the
[SPEAKER_00]: recording space here Maybe the drugs are
kicking in let's just try to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast There's always that one corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always got a little bit of muck in
it I'll admit I've got that one corner in
[SPEAKER_00]: my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get to it's always got a
little funk in there Can you clean that
[SPEAKER_00]: one without taking out all of the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you clean all the odd spaces?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get to the corners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get to the the ducting the fans
the tops of the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you clean all of that if you can do
that without taking out every plant go for
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's no reason But if you've had a
big issue if you've had any bugs any
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew anything like that Then I
would definitely stop the routine clean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything take everything out I'm sure
you guys saw that moth fly by just now We
[SPEAKER_00]: are in what we call Miller season here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people might not know about this
in Colorado We just hit the start of we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of May the start of May here
Right at the beginning of May we get these
[SPEAKER_00]: moths these Miller moths They just come
out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're attracted to the light I don't
know where they come from But they they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up your garage your house and then
when you open a cabinet or something if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in there in the garage You open up
the cabinet they come flying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling because it is the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flying toward my light right now
It's not gonna stop for a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are gross It's Miller time you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to read this message Um,
if you had bugs or something, then I would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely recommend especially powdery
mildew or spider mites or anything worse
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would do a full reset, but if you
haven't found a problem If you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a downside to your perpetual keep it
going Just make sure you're getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and cleaning all those nooks and
crannies cleaning the floor Is there
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you haven't like like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something over the floor to
keep the floor dry to keep water off the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if something's getting under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you have any moisture Calcium
build-up mold see if anything is crept
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath there Just go check the corners
check the details the nooks and crannies
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if you're missing anything
Otherwise keep that perpetual growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope You guys just saw the bug that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have evidence and I'm not really
thinking I'm tripping All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message my dude

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna put a piece of paper over
my drink here so that that moth doesn't

[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds, but I will answer both of
your questions it says when making seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: is it necessary to let the plant fully
mature or Can we harvest when the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are falling out of the buds since the
potency is not a factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question And I don't
care about the buds the flowers the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes the green part at all when I'm
growing for seed I only focus on the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're Growing for seed at this point
focus on the seed when that seed is ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you harvest That is the fruit
you're looking for at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've changed our focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes It is all about the seeds who cares
what those buds are doing I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard me talk about changing my light
cycle When I've got seeded plants my buds
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants look like total shit by the time
they're done when they're seeded They are
[SPEAKER_00]: revegging they're spitting out new shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look really confused, but the seeds
are completely healthy and that is 100% my
[SPEAKER_00]: focus so I don't care about the buds and
neither should you if you are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for seed production The next part
Oh and also you said wait till they fall
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the buds by the time they're
falling out They may actually start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: too hard at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have a problem germinating
They'll get a little too hard the coating
[SPEAKER_00]: on the outside gets a little too thick I
would recommend harvesting before they
[SPEAKER_00]: start falling out generally You can tell
when the seeds are getting ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting hard about five six
seven weeks into the After they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just simply grab a couple you can
see them You can see them in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grab a couple calyxes pull out the seeds
Rub them between my fingers if those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are super hard and put dents in my fingers
when I squeeze them Those seeds are ready
[SPEAKER_00]: if those seeds crush squish or pop they're
obviously not ready So once I've got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of hard seeds in that batch They're
basically ready and I don't need to let
[SPEAKER_00]: them go any further I chopped down that
entire plant hang it upside down let it
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and then at that point it is almost
ready for processing so The first part is
[SPEAKER_00]: no, there's no reason to let the plant
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now focused on growing for seeds
So only focus on that seed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a seed farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question is What would make a
male drop his pollen sacks early?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning they have not opened yet,
but they are falling off when I barely
[SPEAKER_00]: move the plant Thank you for all of your
time and much love Sometimes the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: those are called anthers by the way
Sometimes the plant will begin to make
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers early in the flowering phase And
those are just kind of it's a just its
[SPEAKER_00]: first showing this first anthers It's its
first little ball set right there and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make a lot more So those first few
anthers don't really matter They popped
[SPEAKER_00]: out the plant thought it was time to start
throwing pollen, but it wasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: ready So it just kind of it put out
anthers to show hey I'm ready to go but it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really time for that plant to
pollinate yet So it had to keep developing
[SPEAKER_00]: more anthers and fill those anthers with
pollen So basically what I think happened
[SPEAKER_00]: is those original male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just popped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have any use He wasn't Fully
mature ready to breed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hadn't reached puberty yet is kind of
what I think I'm saying is and he was just
[SPEAKER_00]: showing those Those are like his pre
pubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just showing like look I got balls
dude, but those weren't the balls that
[SPEAKER_00]: were there for breeding It will produce
plenty more pollen sacks plenty more
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers in the future, which will produce
a ton of pollen Sometimes those male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will try to auto flower on you if
you get them root bound or don't give them
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light And a lot of times those
anthers will not produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just be the little starter anthers
to show you hey, I'm gonna go into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: if you Don't do something and I really
think that's kind of what you got here a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of just showing you like hey
I'm a boy and I'm ready to get it on even
[SPEAKER_00]: though those those balls didn't hold any
sperm or any pollen if you will That's he
[SPEAKER_00]: was just showing you I'm ready to go bro
He's giving you a warning like put me in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room with some ladies or I'm gonna do it
myself So I think that that is why those
[SPEAKER_00]: few anthers are falling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry It's going to make a lot more
try to move that male plant as little as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible Because every time you touch it
bump it move it breathe around it pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: is moving Let him build up as much pollen
as he possibly can and then try to give
[SPEAKER_00]: him one good shake when it's time and get
all Of that pollen all over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
