[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 90 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're an old school smoker,
or if you're a Pendiwar and Dab kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a cannabis activist or even
someone who's just curious about the
[SPEAKER_01]: current state of cannabis, This My Friends
is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, they call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send you a big shout
out to all of you who are a huge thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
letting me play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn down that music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, our friend Jesse came over and
we recorded for almost two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to stop for a second and fix the
headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tried to crap out on us, but we got
everything back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do a quick ad and then we will
get on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this podcast is brought to you
by my good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach
Street or check out the Pueblo location on
[SPEAKER_01]: 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, our good friend Jesse works at
Hygro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the manager there.
[SPEAKER_01]: His wife is probably who you'll bump into
either Bernadette or LaDonna is most
[SPEAKER_01]: likely who you're going to see when you go
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple other folks that work
there, but it's most of the time it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, Bern, or LaDonna.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go in there, you're shopping
with my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, these are really cool people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are members of the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not just sales folks with a
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you support our friends at
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you are checking out at Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies, make sure you let
[SPEAKER_01]: them know you listen to the Grow From Your
Heart podcast and they will give you
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial pricing on your entire
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll save you a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I've been rambling
long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let this music fade out and
we will be right back with our good friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, I am back and sitting
across the table from me is our good
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've been a busy man,
so it's always good having you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grower season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is farmer season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, I just threw on the
microphones real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to do a podcast and then
Jesse mentioned something and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse just said, if you were using general
organics to not adjust the pH when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: done, I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what did you say to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you use to adjust the pH if you
had to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying it's built into the formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CA Mag Plus or Cal Mag Plus that it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pH buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure on the entire science
of it, but I do know for a fact that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you try to pH it, it will mess your shit
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have some funky looking
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because if you're using organics,
it's organic and if you go and pour acids
[SPEAKER_01]: in there that we're using, I think it's a
phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the word acid in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells you that it's going to go in
there and start destroying all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: organics and your myco life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just wanted to get that on
recording, guys, since we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the best shit comes out before I
turn on the microphones and I always feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like damn, I wasted some time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to put on the mics and
get that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, welcome to the show, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate having you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all choked up from some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get official.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited Jesse over to do a podcast and
my topic was our friend John Rossum on
[SPEAKER_01]: Periscope asked if he can grow his bag
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is hell yes, you can grow
your bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a really long answer also.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to mention though,
a lot of the older cats that I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: pitch my seeds to are flabbergasted and
blown away by the price of a 10 pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, a 10 pack of seeds will go,
it depends on the breeder, anywhere from
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to 100 bucks for a 10 pack of good
regular or feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swamp boys are doing 180 now for a 10 pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some of these higher known companies
are definitely able to get more money,
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 to 200 bucks for a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of people are going to say,
what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of these old guys,
they say, but dude, I've got a big baggie
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds in my closet from when I used to
smoke pot and sift it out on a record
[SPEAKER_01]: cover, on an album cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you grow those, but do not try
to sell those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason they aren't sellable The reason
that the seeds us breeders are selling and
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing and promoting, the reason they
cost more money is because we know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what's going to come from those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done time selecting the male and
female to produce a seed line that has
[SPEAKER_01]: probably gone several years in testing and
development to figure out what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: No herms, high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and consistency is something I
really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herms, a lot of quality, good resin
production, good flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some plants when you get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked strains down from 90 day
flowering times by breeding it into other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've cut it down by breeding several
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've brought it to 60 days and it's still
pretty much the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we've done is breed it to shorter
flowering plants, put it to the flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the seeds that come from that out,
find the one that's a lot like the
[SPEAKER_01]: original male or female, whichever we were
trying to do, and then put that back to
[SPEAKER_01]: flow because flow is a quick plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just bred things to flow and sped it
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes on traits really well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, she does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are looking to start a
breeding project, get a Colorado Flow and
[SPEAKER_01]: play with her because that's a fun one to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm getting at is those bag seeds
that these older cats or maybe you younger
[SPEAKER_01]: cats have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason those aren't marketable and
sellable is because you don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know the genetic heritage of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are not a marketable seed,
but you can definitely give them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely grow this shit out of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have hermaphrodites,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a bunch of males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have shitty ass ragweed,
but you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: You very well could have.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's getting excited over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can barely fucking... You just blurted
out exactly the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: ChemDog came from... ChemDog was fucking
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: ChemDog is known as one of the strongest
strains on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been on the cover of High Times
Magazine three or four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the single strongest strain on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that was old bag seed when
strains weren't... This is a really deep
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get way into the ChemDog story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't just a bunch of junk strains
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there was, but it's... Chances
are if somebody grew... If you bought that
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of weed and it had a seed in there,
chances are it was decent weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is we don't know what it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people back in the day don't even
know what the girl plant they got or what
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds they got were.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to say this is like Acapulco
Gold or something, but it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that dude said it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before we really knew and cared a
lot about genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also on things you could get,
you could even get Mexican auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want those Mexican auto
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would love to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people message me all the time asking
when I'm going to make auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was never supposed to be about my
brand or my company, but I read genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: will never make auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in the use of auto
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually straying far away from
feminized seeds because I like the males
[SPEAKER_01]: in the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we need male plants and
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't make it enough feminized seeds to
keep people happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they want so many of them damn
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse hit that nail right on the head when
he said you could have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog came from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two dudes sold a guy a bag of weed on a
Grateful Dead parking lot in 95 I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog found seeds in that weed and he
grew that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of one of those seeds,
and you guys go Google the legend of chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog and the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this podcast and
you want to be deep into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and you want to know some
heritage, Google chem dog and the legend
[SPEAKER_01]: of the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I got to give a big shout out to
the Adam Dunn show, a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do an entire episode where chem dog
actually calls in and they discuss where
[SPEAKER_01]: this stream came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people that were in the chain
of that and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all call in.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were on the old school forums if
any of the listeners are forum junkies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already know the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day we're going to have to talk about
OG and if OG means overgrow or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get a few older growers on here
and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I just said OG, I meant overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you meant overgrow the website,
overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a website that we used to frequent
and talk about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool was on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the cool breeders were on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a theory that the OG Kush came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow, but also people think it's the
original gangster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard it ocean grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that on this show in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a few more OG's on the show to
come talk with us on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so grow out those bag seeds
because you could have chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys you could also have junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could totally have junk, but there's a
little pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell clones of junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in Colorado, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't sell your junkie seeds from
your junkie clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's disrespectful to your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's disrespectful to your patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's disrespectful to the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's disrespectful to the future of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow a plant and you take clones of
it, don't give those clones out until you
[SPEAKER_01]: have flowered the damn plant and you
verified that it's something worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many strains available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow something worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not as a breeder, it is so hard to
breed something and then grow 100 seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and realize that you have just created
fucking hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain doesn't do us any good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got 6,000 seeds of it and all I'm
going to do is feed them to some birds
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't want anybody growing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one cross that it was a lemon
kush idea and dude it grew the fattest,
[SPEAKER_01]: chunkiest, tallest nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bigger than my arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have any flavor or any resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just grew the biggest hemp ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have horrible herming problems and all
mine drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your breeding projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because so much of it's involved with
ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem does have a tendency to herm in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got to find, if you're going to
breed with ChemDog, make sure you back
[SPEAKER_01]: cross or out cross that hermit trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go find a solid progeny, two solid progeny
from your F1s and work those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going ahead of myself here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's hard to guess what
pollinated the seeded buds that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got, but you know that that female makes
quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the donor was a male in the room,
maybe something hermed, but it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: just a stress seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually a light leak or something
like that is what's causing these bag
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overnuding.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of overnuding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irregular watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprises on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get them too hot and let them get
too dry, they'll start throwing out seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A seed is the plant's response of,
oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant goes, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to die here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a hornied person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the plant's whole mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin is there to protect the plant so
that it can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pistols, which everybody calls hairs,
those are there to collect pollen so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is all about these plants
reproducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you piss off a plant, it will try to
make a seed as a reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wants to make sure that it
continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't want to be wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's main job in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's its purpose is to reproduce and
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're tricking it in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be respectful to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had a list of which strains
were, here they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue number four and seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the gorilla glue strains were
actually- Bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accidental pollinations that created seeds
that Josie Wales, shout out to Josie
[SPEAKER_01]: Wales, a grower slash breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or good accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're glad that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for popping those beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of Colorado's most popular strains
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my most popular strains for my
growing, my photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a lot of people give me credit
for breeding golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say right now, I did not
breed the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat was bred by a guy known as Mr.
Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an accident that was not meant to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's headphones are cutting out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give him a- Let's pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right guys, I think we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we recorded all the first part
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using the Zoom H6 handy recorder
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I recorded that first
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Livewire Solutions HA04 four channel
stereo headphone amplifier, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a hammer put to it pretty soon here
because it just pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we were on golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying that I did not breed the
golden goat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was put into- Yeah, Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dank bred that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topeka, Kansas of all places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did however get a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started breeding,
I thought I hit Topeka, Kansas of all damn
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost skipped right over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the coolest town in
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to vote for Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to vote for Lawrence,
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done things in Lawrence,
Kansas that I can't even talk about on
[SPEAKER_01]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boss got T-boned in that there's army
base outside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got T-boned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up spending a day and a half in
Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Kansas I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a club every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at our bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the liberal stronghold of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topeka is pretty close too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to Topeka.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to Wichita.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Lawrence for a little while,
so I had a good time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat, I got a hold of a clone
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good friend, Josh, a long time ago gave
me a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hawaiian guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call him the Hawaiian guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called him Pineapple Express is what I
used to call him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't hung out with that dude in a
long ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pineapple Express brought me a clone of
the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started breeding,
one of my ideas was, I felt bad that in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado we had all of the elite genetics
and everybody in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never felt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, but I'm a compassionate
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, how do I get these clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I can't get you clones of
these elite cuts, but I will make seeds of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My idea was to make seeds of the golden
goat just by reversing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did put seeds of the golden goat out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one that made the S1 feminized
golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, I'm the only one that
has done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put about 5,000 of those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the only people that have
bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I think Scott's done something
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Gage make one strain with golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ali, fuck, what's his seed
company name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ali G, no, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dude out of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ali G, or Al G, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to Google this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of phonetically, but he's bred a
couple strains with golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great plant, but it was like we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado takes pretty much all the credit
for that, but that is definitely a local
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's partly my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pain in the ass to keep a
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take clones from that golden
goat often.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got one, hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee in a few more years,
a lot of strains are getting harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good original.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old school blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me a good chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a P91 clone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, everyone used to grow Romulan.
I've heard a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to give you a shout
out right quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse is actually the moderator,
and he's the one that started the,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the name of the Facebook group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coloradope Cannabis Growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys join Jesse's Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're serious, I will troll you a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you have a little bit of thick
skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're not an internet vagina
because I'm a troll and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: you, but it's a fun group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, they, uh, help you learn about
cannabis in a fun, positive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will clear up all the rumors and myths.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a question, come join the
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a cannabis grower, if you're
curious about cannabis, we love teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another avenue to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're a total noob, um,
you know, not to be a dick, but that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are better groups to find this,
you know, this group is comprised of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, but don't be shy,
you guys, if you have a question or hit me
[SPEAKER_01]: up on Facebook or Jesse directly,
and we will answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse may take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't carry the iPhone like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not attached to it like I am,
but I've usually got the phone in my
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket when I'm working at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the phone turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the phone turned off because,
um, there's no service back there anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, our facility is like a fucking bomb
shelter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can live back there for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to turn a radio on in the middle of it
when all the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you get to Kavita's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's still, you know,
we're way off topic here, but in Denver,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys, this is something that I
recently heard and or read about and had a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with multiple people about in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're driving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running old school magnetic
ballast, I'm not sure if the new digitals
[SPEAKER_01]: will do it, but the old school magnetics,
if you're running enough of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: they put off an AM frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take an AM radio in that room,
you have it tuned into the station.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk near those ballasts,
it will cut out and make a weird humming
[SPEAKER_01]: noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at a specific frequency too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, uh, I've tried it on a couple of
places I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it makes a hum and some, something
like dashes and beeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it definitely puts off a unique
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Denver police are using an ultra
sensitive radio pickup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not probably a strong antenna is what
I guess they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're driving around neighborhoods
and when they get that, they're driving
[SPEAKER_01]: back by with infrared cameras and now
they're checking your lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, they're all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once they've done that, they're
going back home or back to the station and
[SPEAKER_01]: checking to see if you're a medical
marijuana caregiver so that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: permission to have all these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or since in the state of Colorado,
we're only supposed to have six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got all that light, you're
supposed to be registered as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not, they go and knock on your
door and ask what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Denver, uh, be careful if you've got
those magnetic ballasts for the cops or
[SPEAKER_01]: for the guys using magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come buy some Nanos from me or our Denver
store on beach street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, ask for, uh, uh, Brandon or Cassandra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassandra.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the chick you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the Denver store?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to the Denver store,
so I may have to drop in there and just go
[SPEAKER_01]: wander around and not even tell them who I
am and just walk around and look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do that when they don't know who
I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting, we're getting high and
getting off topic here, but we've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: few dabs, so that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be controversial here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot prove this, but it is my theory
that the girl scout cookies is probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck up and it was an accident and it's a
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they bred that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a reason I haven't
released any of my stuff yet and that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very high standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I haven't been able to achieve
them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, girl scout cookies,
in my opinion, is a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not breed stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've crossed it to the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really neat breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a really neat plant to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah, but it produces hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it to the grateful dog and you would
not believe what it put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you a little bit after we record
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got seen some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of other people that have
grown that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that one's that's, that's,
that's a tasty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of the other one of the King
cam to the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that is definitely, um,
you know, after breeding with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and seeing a couple of different
hybrids of it, you know, you can recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: it real quick for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we're talking about herm seeds or
not herm seeds, about bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're going to go bag seeds,
I already said that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be careful for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when you're growing these bag seeds,
uh, treat it just like a normal seed
[SPEAKER_01]: during veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're not going to know what the
parents are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to pay a lot of
attention to it during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start flowering, you have to look
every single day for hermaphrodite flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: on these plants every day and sometimes
twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look out for males too.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first three weeks, look out for
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had plants surprise me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were full on female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until about day 20 and then it popped open
a nut sack somewhere and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for male flowers, herm flowers all
over the entire plant once or twice a day
[SPEAKER_01]: through the entire bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a bag seed because it could
herm out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a seed for a reason and it could
herm out in the end of week eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it does, you either need to be able
to harvest it before it produces a seed or
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get in there and be able to
tweeze out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it makes one or two male flowers,
sometimes you can pull them out with
[SPEAKER_01]: tweezers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the plant, spray the plant with a
water bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just mist it a little bit because mist
deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture will ruin pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give it a nice mist, get in there with
some tweezers and pull out those male
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, put them in a trash bag,
throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in an argument with someone in
Facebook land the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture of a friend's hemp
plant, a male, and he told me that that
[SPEAKER_00]: growth spot was ruined for life and that
pollen doesn't die and it travels for
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to go to that forum or that
post and just troll that guy is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, pollen, you can get rid of
pollen quite easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweep the floor, get in there with some
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water deactivates pollen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to store.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's so hard to store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep my pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have little vials of pollen that are
sealed and they are in size inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: another jar that is sealed and that is
inside of a refrigerator that stays dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how careful I am with my pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Rusty?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rusty threw a bunch of pollen on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time he was here, he dropped off
like four or five little bags of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there may be some Canaventure iry
crosses coming up in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all my Yeti stuff came from
was a friendly pollen delivery from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, shout out to that Yeti OG that you
made live resin with last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was memorable, remarkable,
legendary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that was back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that made that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was the cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I get to be in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had some good runs back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like everybody got busy and
carried away and all the hash artists got
[SPEAKER_01]: too busy and were just all disconnected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need to all reconnect again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need everybody on the podcast again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody got to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get a party going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't all connected in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 100 is coming up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be number 90,
I think, right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do an intro for it, but I think
this is number 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number 100 is coming up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any cool ideas, if you want to
be on episode number 100, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hiregenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do you have to add about bag
seed, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was assuming, alleging that Girl Scout
cookies was probably an accident and came
[SPEAKER_01]: from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A part of my theory on that is because
I've heard so many different rumors and
[SPEAKER_01]: legends of how it was made and who made
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never, the people that are
alleged to have made it have never said
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is and they won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear it's an F1 Durbin is what I hear a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll call them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've said straight up, they've said two
or three different stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't even believe anything they
said at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read at least three different
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: In high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all say they came from the same
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all say no one has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have Girl Scout cookies yet
by now, let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause everybody in our crew has a,
I've got the platinum, I've got the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got cookies and cream by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got cookie rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cookies times everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that are done with it and
letting it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much all that Maddy and
Spence want to smoke is cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's still one of my favorite smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some in the cloner now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me know if you want another one
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I spread that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you really want something,
go to the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, I've got two sources for
clothes, two or three good sources for
[SPEAKER_01]: clones around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them, he gets everything from
the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of a quiet guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does not look like a pot grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like you probably would work on
computers or study law somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he shows up with a briefcase and
opens it up and drops me off a few
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings of some elite shit that he got
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love when clones come from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it seems like right around the
same time he gets them either you or
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence will end up with the same cuttings
and you guys will throw me a cut or I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: trade you a cut just cause that's how our
group works and I'll run them side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always so amazed that everybody
got the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how did Spence end up with this Girl
Scout cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my other friend ended up with the Girl
Scout cookies and I ran them and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: the same fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started from the same seed
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I mean, just seeing,
I mean, we've all grown enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell instantly if it's it how do
all these people on the internet have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same freaking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're getting around.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking a horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, if you get some weed,
if you get some good quality cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got a couple of healthy good looking
seeds in there and you don't have money to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend on some high quality seeds that we
know all the history behind them and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were bred by magic elves in a dungeon in
Quebec.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just being a smart ass here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't want to pay good money
for seeds, if you don't have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: good clones, just throw some of those bag
seeds in a paper towel, germinate them,
[SPEAKER_01]: start them out just like you would any
other seeds and pay a lot of attention and
[SPEAKER_01]: then grow them out, smoke it with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something I really have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a fucking clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, you guys, you wouldn't believe
how many people say, look what I grew from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, can I get a clone of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, I didn't take any
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, take a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a little clone, you dip it some
shit and you put it in a router.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it herms really bad, don't take a
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw away those clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it grows balls, throw away all the
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because bag seeds are free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already paid 50 bucks for that eighth
or whatever you paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you grow the seeds that are in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could grow the next Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could grow the next Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could grow the next Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have the next OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: SFV, Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Krippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Krippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single strain we were smoking came
from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of one strain that didn't
come from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can, I'll give you $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every fucking cannabis plant we
were smoking came from a seed somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow out that bag seed,
you could have a cup winner right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of times, if you don't even
know what it was bred with, that's yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to give anybody credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the Jesse's pride and joy
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the Cannabis Cup winnings come
up, they go, and the winner for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: heady indica here in Denver, Colorado with
the Cannabis Cup goes to Jesse for Jesse's
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystery Funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just won that Cannabis Cup with a bag
seed that you found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why couldn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: True story.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rambling a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think we're, I think it might
be, we've been going for close to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could probably start wrapping up this
part, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we tried to wrap up this
episode, but the conversation kept going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I decided to do was to make this a
two-part episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will drop episode number 91 Thursday
morning, and that will be part two of
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse and I hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you guys for listening
