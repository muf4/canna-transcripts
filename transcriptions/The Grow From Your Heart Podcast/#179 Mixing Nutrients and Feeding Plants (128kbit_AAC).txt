[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 179 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout outs to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Koosh, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are joining me on a smoke
session right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got done smoking some huge dads of
Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cascade was grown by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extraction was done by our friend,
the Barefoot Grower, and I am smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: through my Hitman Hammerhead rig with a
brand new Quartz Banger from our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped by Elevate today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to replace a few nails and carb caps
and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in there thinking I was going to
buy two things, and I walked out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: with a whole bag of goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took all my money today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Elevate
Glass at 517 South Dejon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a new rig, if you need a carb
cap, if you need a nail, if you need an
[SPEAKER_00]: e-nail, they had all kinds of great new
shit in there today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an e-nail that you can operate
with your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the lighting scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a light of every color on top of
it, and you could open up this app on your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone, and you could make that thing look
like a damn light show at a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 517 South Dejon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we're doing shout outs,
huge shout out to my friends at Handmade
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm wearing this Grow From Your
Heart podcast hoodie, and I am nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super cold here in Colorado,
but I am not shivering at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hoodies look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some artwork done,
if you need shirts, if you need hoodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you need stickers, if you need hat
pins, I highly recommend my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: HandmadeApparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, HandmadeApparel.biz for all
your custom printing needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you listen to The Grow
From Your Heart podcast and tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take very good care of you
getting all of your printing work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we're doing shout outs,
holy crap, you guys, I've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about Patreon for the past few weeks on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain Patreon really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a website where people can go
and they can sign up to financially
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sign up, you put in your credit card
info, and once a month, it will pay me the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that you have decided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I got an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has decided that every month,
they are going to contribute $10 to The
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person is throwing down $10 every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want your name set on
the show, so I'm not going to call you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like your name set on the show,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will certainly say it for you because I
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to everybody that has
thrown down a Patreon contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roll through on the first of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them around the third of the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich off the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said many times, I'm using the
Patreon contributions to cover the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: my website, and it will also replace some
recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My SD card from my Zoom H6 took a shit,
so I will use the funds to replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do more podcasts on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy these little microphone covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to rub it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little foam microphone cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy a lot of those because I try to give
a fresh, foamy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the guests come over, I try to have a
fresh foam cover on there because people
[SPEAKER_00]: cough into it, and people rub their faces
on it on accident because they forget the
[SPEAKER_00]: mic's there and they bump into it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend the money on these little foam
covers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I'm going to need a new
MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel this one's starting to slow down
and glitch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that funding will go,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thank you to those people that
contributed to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that just threw down $10 per
month, that is super amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more information on Patreon,
go to patreon.com slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you want is right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's get down to the
... Music won't turn down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mixer's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get down to business, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we are going to talk about proper
mixing and watering techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was asking me questions about
mixing their nutrients and mixing their
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and then I got a tweet about mixing
nutrients and mixing water, and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be a great episode to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a friend starting a brand new
hydro setup, and he needed some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was going to talk about it,
I figured let's put a microphone in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of my face and do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's podcast is going to be about
properly mixing your nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to talk a little bit
about properly watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, before I get too far
into this, I want to say that this advice
[SPEAKER_00]: should work for small gardens,
large gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should work for soilless and soil
gardens, and this also should work for
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there will be some adjusting to
be done for different applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of this will apply to most
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a TLO or a no-till or a
living soil, this probably won't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you no-till and TLO guys, we'll get
frosty organics back, we'll get barefoot
[SPEAKER_00]: back, and we'll do another show about that
organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, we're going to talk about mixing
with bottles and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first point will be clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good water is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse osmosis water, RO water,
is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not everybody can get an
RO machine and install it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom or in their kitchen for their
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't do RO water, tap water is
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, I would
recommend that you go to either the pet
[SPEAKER_00]: store like the fish tank store or either
the hydroponic store and get yourself an
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is is a pump that sits outside
of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might electrocute yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pump that goes outside of the
water, and it's got a line that runs to an
[SPEAKER_00]: air stone, and you'll need to buy some
clear line, some flex hose or some clear
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have the right size line sitting
right next to the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll need air stones to put in the
bottom of your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fill up your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the aquarium air pump next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to have the aquarium air
pump higher than your water because if the
[SPEAKER_00]: power does go out, you don't want water
siphoning down the line and coming out at
[SPEAKER_00]: the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the pump higher than the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it on the ground because it can
work as a siphon if the power goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your filled container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your aquarium air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your plastic line going to some
air stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those air stones go in the bottom of that
container that's filled with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you plug it in, and it simply bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it up all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might get kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be like, just turn it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bubble, and it'll bubble,
bubble, bubble that chlorine out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, within 24 to 48 hours,
you'll get rid of most of that chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some things that can only
be taken out by reverse osmosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but honestly, if you are running a home
grow and you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a home grow, you're probably going to be
okay using tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's not that major of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is if you're
using tap water, you can use less CalMag
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you're using reverse osmosis
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tap water already has plenty of
calcium in it, so you can reduce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using RO, you need to use the
recommended amount or pretty close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the major difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be okay if you can't use
reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about the temperature of
your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that when you're
mixing your nutrients, you have your water
[SPEAKER_00]: between 65 and 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's best for your pH and for your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going hydro, I can say that if
you go anywhere above 70, you do kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage algae growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going hydro, try to keep your
water around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going soil, soil is mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 to 75 works.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 is about ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 is a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never go lower than 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you water your plants with water that's
cooler than 65, they will start to make
[SPEAKER_00]: this claw-like shape in the leaves and
they will stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like sticking your feet or your
hands in cold water, so don't do that to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is coming out of your spigot
or your spout, wherever your water is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, if the source is too warm or
too cold, for example, right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, it has been ridiculously cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 17 degrees the other day when I
went to work at 7 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filled the containers with water from
the RO machine and that water was 62
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no chance I was going to feed
that water to the plants, so we use bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: heaters to heat the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too cold, you can use chillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking to invest money in
items to keep your water at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, you can use the lights in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are filling your reservoir and
putting your bubblers in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can move that to the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may deal with a little bit more
humidity, but the grow lights in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room will get your water to the correct
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little while, but that will
get it to the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may also have the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a hydro grow and you've
got the hydro reservoir in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps you're running a flood and drain
table and the reservoir is underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the room is heating up the water too
much and that's when you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: a chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually realized that I said something
wrong a couple of minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is too cold, you need a
bucket heater and if your water is too
[SPEAKER_00]: warm, that's when you need a chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized as I was saying it that I said
that backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have covered the basics of getting your
water to the appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to talk about measuring and
mixing your nutrients into your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you need for this is a
clean and accurate measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have some measuring cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the shot glass and the beer glass
looking style cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall with them is they are glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're clumsy like me, it may be better
for you to get the plastic style.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something with milliliters,
with tablespoons and teaspoons,
[SPEAKER_00]: with ounces, because each brand of
nutrients is going to ask for different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like brands that go by milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milliliters per gallon is my favorite,
but each brand does their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll need a measuring cup or a
measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using dry nutrients like veg
bloom, you may need a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you have a pH meter,
a PPM meter and possibly an EC meter and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can highly recommend the Blue Lab combo
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all of the above on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the PPM, the EC, the pH and a
thermometer all in one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I can recommend if you,
with any pH meter, keep the probe wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal it up somehow with some pH seven
solution in there and keep that probe wet
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you can, because that will keep
it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say about pH probes, if it dries,
it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that fucker wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also calibrate your equipment
frequently, at least once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with it a lot,
do it once a week, but at least once a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the big grow, if I'm working in a big
grow, you guys, you know, I bounce around.
[SPEAKER_00]: From large grow to large grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's up to me, when I'm using those pH
meters about once every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself just go into some solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dump the pH solution into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that's four and one that's
probably seven or 10 and just check them
[SPEAKER_00]: and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't come out perfectly
accurate, take a minute and fix the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe five, maybe 10 minutes at the
absolute most.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's frustrating, you give me a hard
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just adjust the calibration on your pH
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I went off on a rant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a bucket or a
reservoir with a clearly marked
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement area, either like a reservoir
from the hydro shop that is already a
[SPEAKER_00]: predetermined volume, or what I like to
use is the, I think they're 32 and 55
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon Rubbermaid trash cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy the trash can at Lowe's and I also
get the little wheels that go underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: it so that you can roll that sucker
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will get a five gallon bucket or
one of those five gallon, like the deep
[SPEAKER_00]: rock water bottles or whatever brand water
bottle, the five gallon kind that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go buy one of those and I will use it
to measure out five gallons and I'll mark
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the inside and the outside of my
trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll measure to 10 gallons and
mark it on the inside and outside of my
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll do 15 and I'll do it in
increments of five all the way up to 25 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 or 50 or however big my container is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I can see five, 10,
15 or however many gallons I've got and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a clean marked container that
you could put water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need to be movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to get it from your water to
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about wheels, think about how
you're gonna carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys are probably just gonna
be mixing in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Lowe's bucket, the Home Depot
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, keep it affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna buy one of those fancy
reservoirs from the grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it, be my guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great, looks great in pictures
and it's already marked for the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind as soon as you pull up
to the house and carry that thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, everybody knows you grow weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you've got a chosen
reservoir, a chosen container.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is that you
need to clean this occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clean it probably every use if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a big trash can, I understand
that's kind of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a place to rinse it out
and hose it out, try to get to it as
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some biofilm buildup on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will start to mess with your EC,
your PPM and your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes a few extra minutes to just
clean stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a trash can, you could probably
sneak it out to the backyard and hose it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People won't wonder too much what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that reservoir from the
hydro store, everyone's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's cleaning his weed reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you might wanna think about
what you're gonna buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hosing out a five gallon bucket is really
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that in the bathtub,
you can do that in the shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think about cleaning your
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that frequently, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you've got a clean
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step is to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either using your RO water or your
tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up to if you need 15 gallons,
if you need 20 gallons, fill it to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you need it to that gallon amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a five gallon bucket,
fill it up to the five gallon point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a five gallon bucket, there will be
some extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not fill it all the way to the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably like an inch or two of
extra space in there, maybe three inches
[SPEAKER_00]: of extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fill it all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making a reservoir, try to have
a little extra room in your reservoir as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about why here in just a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fill up your container and you
check the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is check the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the temperature is too high or too low,
we're gonna use the proper tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: either the bucket heater or maybe an
aquarium heater or a chiller, or we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna use the heat from the grow room,
or we're gonna use whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you gotta do it, get that water to
the appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, you may have
wanted to fill this up 24 to 48 hours in
[SPEAKER_00]: advance so that you could start bubbling
it and then you can also get your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature correction device in there at
that time so that when it comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: mix the nutrients, you're already at the
right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running a commercial grow
before you leave tonight, fill up your
[SPEAKER_00]: containers with water, put your chillers
or your bucket heaters in there and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them run for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set them on a timer maybe to click on
three hours before you come in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning and that shit might start getting
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be correct by the time you get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think ahead, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking ahead and growing is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your container, get the
temperature of that water correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to mix up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's when you need that clean mixing
container, that clean measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing, be accurate,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says, okay, this is a side
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says 50 mils per gallon,
you can probably get away with 25 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: mils per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever you decide to mix,
be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wrote down that your mix is 30
milliliters, put 30 milliliters in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do 29, don't do 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be as accurate as you can and your plants
will love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to take better notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to correct things in the
future if you see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing your nutrients,
be as accurate as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, never mix your bottled nutrients
together without mixing them into a large
[SPEAKER_00]: container of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients are in separate bottles
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just because they want to sell
you two bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are elements in each bottle that if
they were sold together would bind and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would deactivate basically the ingredients
that are in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you pour bottle A into this much
water, it dilutes it strong enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: where when you pour bottle B into that
much water, they will not create a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical bond and it will not disrupt your
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never mix your nutrients together
without plenty of water in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into actually doing the
mix, the actual mix of the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: making the soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should talk about is wear
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some nitrile gloves, some rubber
gloves, some hand protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things you're going to be
touching, pH down is bad for your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My skin reacts funky to CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: From some brands of CalMag, my skin will
get splotchy if I touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things that we play with in
the grow are not really good for our skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend that when you walk into the
grow, you're just wearing rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black nitrile are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fit the best shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make my hands smell super
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're mixing nutrients,
you guys, wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might feel nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in there to be stylish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some sort of protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's those goggles, the Science Lab
goggles, that's probably what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend because I have heard a story of
a friend who actually listens to this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was mixing nutrients in his private
grow and he splashed maybe one drop of pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down in his eye and he had to pull his
phone out of his pocket and he had to use
[SPEAKER_00]: Siri to call 911 for himself because he
could not see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went into full panic mode because it
hurt so bad and he had to call the police
[SPEAKER_00]: and the paramedics to come to his grow to
rescue him because he got products in his
[SPEAKER_00]: eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get one set of eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to fuck them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful in the grow, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your eyes, with your fingers,
with your hands, we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room safety in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put on some nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some eye protection and then grab
your clean and trusty measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about actually
mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I asked our Facebook friends and my
Instagram friends for guidance on this and
[SPEAKER_00]: nine out of 10 people said, mix your
potassium silicates first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using some sort of potassium
silicate product, if you're using Botanic
[SPEAKER_00]: Air, it's just called potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using Osa 90, is it Osa 90 or
28?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever Osa product you're using,
if you're using Osa for potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicates, everybody says to put that in
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium silicates first, stir that
for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it emulsified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it fully emulsified into your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see it in there, you need to
stir longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the potassium silicates,
everybody recommends that you add CalMac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add in the recommended or appropriate
amount of CalMac, stir again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, if you're using
Micro, that's when you would add in your
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using Micro, you might want
to read about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your nutrient line has something
else that is covering the Micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check and see what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, everybody would recommend that
you use your base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a brand that only has one
bottle of base nutrients, add in your base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients at the appropriate amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using something like Advanced
Nutrients that has an A and a B,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would definitely do A first,
give it a little stir, then put in B and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is all about chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing things in this order so that
things do not bond in specific ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix in your potassium silicate,
your CalMac, your Micro, your base,
[SPEAKER_00]: your A and B if you have a two-part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when you would add in any
other additives that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding a bloom booster,
if you're adding any sweeteners or bud
[SPEAKER_00]: hardeners, those would all get mixed in
lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last, now something that somebody
recommended to me, and I checked on this
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes sense, stir counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is all about bonding of
certain molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it sounds crazy, you guys,
but do research on that if you'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stirring your solution counterclockwise
will have a difference in bonding of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules in your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested, read about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got all of our
products stirred into our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all been stirred counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all at the appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hanging out for a couple of seconds,
getting all mixed in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to check the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we want to check the PPMs?
[SPEAKER_00]: The particles per million tells us how
much stuff is in our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you feed your plants too much
stuff, they're going to choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that there's not
too much stuff in there, not too many
[SPEAKER_00]: particles, not too many nutrients,
not too many elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many PPMs do we want to get our
water to?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of depends on what phase of
growth or bloom you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seedlings and small plants don't need a
lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need a lot of PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to start off at a lower PPM for my
smaller plants, somewhere around 600 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 900 PPMs for the small stuff, like the
small veg plants in cups and small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get bigger, I do increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week four, I'm usually up to about 1500
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In veg, I don't really go too hard with
the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them base nutrients, potassium
silicates, Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give them some stuff to keep them
moving root-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they really don't get a whole lot of
nutrients in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to get stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we start flowering, that's when I
kind of start boosting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week one of flowering, I'll probably start
off right about maybe a thousand or 1300
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will increase until I hit,
honestly, I'll get close to 1900 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I would not recommend if
you're using bottled nutrients and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not a very experienced grower,
you probably shouldn't get over 1700 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 1800 particles per million in your
solution, or you'll start burning your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you know what you're doing
and you can mix and match nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're not giving it too much of one
thing, but you're supplementing what's
[SPEAKER_00]: missing by adding more PPMs, then you may
be able to get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be very careful because once you've
burnt the plants, you can't take that
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give more, but you can't take
anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, most of the feed charts that
come with bottled nutrients these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them are pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow that feed chart,
maybe reduce it, maybe use about 75% of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the bottle says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the companies will make a feed
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow that and it won't get you over 1700
or 1800 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see what that chart does and
adjust from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go a little harder,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you realize you need to go a little
lighter, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you can do so you've
got your solution mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're checking your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like it's right where you want
it, now you need to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like the PPMs are too high,
if you feel like it's too hot for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you can simply add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got everything mixed up and the
PPMs are hitting more than you want for
[SPEAKER_00]: that week and you feel like it's too hot
for the plants, add a little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using RO water, put RO water in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, add more tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your PPM meter and put it in your
solution that's mixed up and then get your
[SPEAKER_00]: regular water and just slowly add it and
watch the numbers on your PPM meter go
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've get it to the
acceptable appropriate number,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when it's time to adjust your
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you do is adjust your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put it in the water,
give it a little stir around, give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple seconds to adjust and see where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's up too high, you need to put some
pH down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too low, you need to put some pH
up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good area for your plants for most
plants to be is 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH your solution to 6.2 and you should be
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My smaller plants, they go a little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My larger plants may get a little higher,
but 6.2 is a good general range of pH for
[SPEAKER_00]: most cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole episode about the importance
of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded that episode on August 10th of
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually episode number 88 and it is
called The Importance of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check that out,
it is still in the feed on iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher and it's on the website
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 100 episodes available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to go back in history,
check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's episode number 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Importance of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, so we've got our
reservoir filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our nutrients mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our PPMs adjusted to the
appropriate PPMs to where it won't be too
[SPEAKER_00]: strong of a solution for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our pH adjusted to approximately
6.2 or whatever you're finding appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for your garden at this stage of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about actually physically
feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running an auto hydro system or
a soil or soilless or cocoa system that's
[SPEAKER_00]: on a drip system, make sure that the
plants get, that the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the soil gets fully saturated when
you water those plants with your
[SPEAKER_00]: automation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to figure out how long it comes
on and how frequently that watering system
[SPEAKER_00]: comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to do an entire episode about
building a watering system and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be probably two or three
episodes from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may put that one out as a Thursday bonus
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running an automated system,
mainly focus on getting everything
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated, let it dry kind of,
and then saturate it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to run the timer and see how
long it takes to saturate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have to pay attention to
how long it takes them to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have to make that timer
run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's duration and interval is what
you're going to have to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a day to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much how you're going to
have to set up any drip system with any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of hydro or cocoa or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that if you're using cubes
or whatever you're using, make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they get fully saturated and that they've
got the appropriate dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just repeat that cycle over and
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants get larger and further into
the flower phase, you may have to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: either the duration of watering or the
less interval between waterings is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you'll have to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see that happening as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that auto watering episode that's
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about watering your soil or
cocoa or soilless mix plants that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're watering with a pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to the reservoir and
just getting a pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I use in my personal grow,
I use like a Kool-Aid pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a one gallon plastic pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use two of them so that I could scoop
water with both hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are in seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can reach them just by kind of doing a
short band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk down the middle of the row and
water two plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scoop water out of the res, turn a
little bit, water two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the Kool-Aid pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the commercial grow, I use a water
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a pump in a trash can, which is the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trash cans on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a pump there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a sump pump that plugs into the
wall that runs to a hose, which runs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water wand, I basically squeeze a
trigger and the water comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got about a two foot attachment
extension on it so that I can get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are at the end of the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like the water wand for the
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I either use the pitcher or a water
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to do it is find the
water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to make a little bit of a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the pitcher, you can kind of put the
water where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the pitcher is more time
efficient because I can grab water and
[SPEAKER_00]: pour it, grab water and pour it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no time for it to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pours out of the pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the water wand, with the five gallon
pot at the commercial grow, I count to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: as I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I count one, two, three, four,
five, and it takes me to 70 to water a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon pot appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes, that's probably 50 seconds
of me counting to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how fast I just probably over count
time, but that's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd prefer the pitcher method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any way you do it, soak the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're watering the plants,
make sure you fully saturate that root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that soil needs to get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see some runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want at least a little bit of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got catch trays underneath your
plants, if they're in the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to see runoff from every single
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to know that every inch of soil
inside that pot got saturated with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and water so that when those
roots, when it does start to dry out and
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots go growing in there,
they find those nutrients in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, hey, there's some more
stuff for me to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really good to saturate the whole
thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you saturate your entire root
ball, get a little bit of runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then let them start to dry out over
the next few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't water until they get kind of
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pick them up and see how long
light they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they start getting light,
that's when they need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start learning the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to watch for when the leaves
start to droop just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, if you're doing it right,
your leaves are facing up just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're praying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a good job, the leaves are
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting thirsty,
they'll start to curl down and hang and
[SPEAKER_00]: droop just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see that droop is when
those plants want water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most ideal time to water those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can figure out that timing from
when you water them to when that droop
[SPEAKER_00]: barely starts and water them right then,
every time, your plants will be as happy
[SPEAKER_00]: as they can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find that timing, that sweet
spot of right before they droop and when
[SPEAKER_00]: they get super light, and then water them
right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will get easier the more you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you grow, the less these things
will seem like a challenge to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll walk in the grove and you'll be
able to see, oh, I can tell by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the soil that that plant needs
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, just keep practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soak the entire plant, give it some
time to dry, then re-soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then watch the leaves for indicators of
issues, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves start doing funny shit,
that tells you that there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your leaves are gonna tell you if the
plants were overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are overwatered,
they're going to start making a claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's overwatered or too cold,
it will look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will still be horizontal and
they won't droop, but they will claw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start to look like, just hold
your hand out straight and then make a
[SPEAKER_00]: claw like you're a monster, that claw
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your leaves will start doing
if they are overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are underwatered, they'll just
start drooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just go limp and start hanging
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get severely underwatered,
the tops of your plants will just start
[SPEAKER_00]: drooping over and they'll look dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be scared as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants do get to that sort of a
dryness, I recommend that you don't water
[SPEAKER_00]: them with full strength nutrients right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water them with light nutrients
just to get them alive and back to life
[SPEAKER_00]: and woken up and then feed them with
nutrients later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I see it is I don't want to get
woken up to a big gigantic meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to eat spaghetti and
meatballs and garlic bread first thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have maybe some oatmeal and
some OJ to get myself started,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're that droopy, you just want to
hydrate them and get them moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to clog them up with more
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you guys want to wake up and
eat a steak right away, but that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: how I'm gonna roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so underwater, we talked about that
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants start looking like they're
getting crispy or if they're getting funky
[SPEAKER_00]: on the edges or if they have rust-looking
spots on them, you may be giving them too
[SPEAKER_00]: much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the edges of your leaves are starting
to get crispy and over-sharp, you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: using too much Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to reduce your nutrients,
you can do that, but that burn is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on the new growth and make
sure that you're not burning the new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay if leaves get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to go ahead and remove a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut it right off or pull it off with
your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably more leaves coming to
back that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've noticed is when you take
off leaves, the plants will just replace
[SPEAKER_00]: it if it needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the leaves are gonna tell you if you
have any sort of deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves start getting pale yellow,
if the plants are going slow and not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing fast enough, you probably are
missing some nutrients and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably increase your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that could be a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a lot of problems if you're
showing deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, pH issues disguise themselves
as deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about that in episode 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a lot of attention to the leaves,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paying attention to the leaves will really
help, but also keep notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep notes of what you mixed into
the solution and what you fed,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to write down what you mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to write down the pH and try to write
down the PPMs of every feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the date and time and also take
notes of anything you saw in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: that day so that you can look back and you
can have a chart and some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, oh, look, on this day,
my pH was a little high and now this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is acting funky and now I know that I need
to make the pH lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've learned that OG cush
plants, the cushier the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more calmagic it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stuff like golden goat is always
macro deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just stuff like that that you
learn and you can really boost up the
[SPEAKER_00]: macro nutrients with golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stuff you learn from growing
specific plants over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from each watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from your notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely a huge part of what
makes me a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have covered the basics and
maybe a little bit of more than the basics
[SPEAKER_00]: of mixing your nutrients and properly
watering your plants to properly saturate
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and give them some time to dry
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I posted to Facebook that I was
seeking help and guidance for this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode because I wanted to make sure that
basically said, hey, I'm writing a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like treating your body herbally and
doing a round of antibiotics at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important part here was that we need
to pay a little bit of attention to where
[SPEAKER_00]: our products are coming from and what
we're putting into the products that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are calling medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that what you're using is
healthy for your mind, body, and your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got another message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, if you add a form of high
quality fulvic acid to your guy's water
[SPEAKER_00]: before anything else, it helps buffer pH
of your solution and provide a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: form of chelation without adding any NPEK
or PPMs to your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in any type of setup,
super cost efficient, and it helps your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to naturally and easily uptake the
nutrients and minerals you give them,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the hard ones such as iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy recommends that we add a form of
high quality fulvic acid and he recommends
[SPEAKER_00]: Full Power or Shilajit as the brand to use
and he says it will he says to add that
[SPEAKER_00]: before adding anything else and it will
help buffer your pH and it will help your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants uptake your nutrients better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the part that really got my
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said also, we should completely move
away from harmful and non-regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farming practices such as synthetic
fertilizer programs that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable and do more harm than good to
our garden's planet and its limited
[SPEAKER_00]: natural life sustaining resources of life
such as water, land, and clean air.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, there's nothing wrong
with using bottled nutrients or other
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of farming, but we must still be
aware of the effects we have on our planet
[SPEAKER_00]: and fellow man through our action or worse
yet inaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I figured I'd touch on that last
part, my shameless alternative techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from a guy who calls himself LOS
gardens on Instagram, LOS underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate it because we all need
to be reminded occasionally to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to where our products are coming
from and what we're putting into ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the insight and I appreciate
the help and advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I understand that not everybody
is able to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody lives in a farm area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that a lot of us live in
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us have our neighbors right next
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost reach out one of my windows
and touch my neighbor's house is how close
[SPEAKER_00]: we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely understand that we don't all
have space to do organic farming
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that we can all conceal the
odors and the extra ingredients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not judging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to use bottled nutrients,
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use bottled nutrients myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just think a little bit while we're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not try to support companies that
don't support us and companies that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: support the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to choose where your money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choose wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody who commented
and replied on my Facebook and Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: post that helped me put this episode
together.

[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank everybody that
listened to the bonus episode that I put
[SPEAKER_00]: out Thursday.

episode that I put out Thursday about
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonal affective disorder, you may want

colder winter climates where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing our asses off for the past few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a good episode for you to listen
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have found two solutions for the
folks that have been asking for old
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a short term solution and a
long term solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are underway.
