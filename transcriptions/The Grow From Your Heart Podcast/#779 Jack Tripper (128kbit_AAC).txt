[SPEAKER_00]: so let's jump right into talking about my
strain jack tripper um a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to ask right away did you name this
strain after the character from three's
[SPEAKER_00]: company and the answer is yes i absolutely
did when i was a little kid i grew up with
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom watching three's company i will
always remember that song coming knock on
[SPEAKER_00]: our door and now it's going to be stuck in
your head too you are welcome but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally where i got the name jack tripper
it is a jack the ripper cross it had to
[SPEAKER_00]: have jack something in there it gets me so
high that i feel like i'm in a psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: vortex jack tripper jack the ripper it was
freaking perfect so let's talk more about
[SPEAKER_00]: jack tripper i really like this strain
because it tastes like a refreshing lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: turp with some chemicals and crazy funk to
it and i really do enjoy that it's got its
[SPEAKER_00]: own unique lemon candy we're going to talk
a lot about that lemon flavor but i really
[SPEAKER_00]: love this psychedelic buzz that i get from
it i talk about like when you take a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: or a fat bong rip of it and that's
something we should talk about too the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas are totally different
in the concentrates than in the flowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: this product but when you hit it the buzz
is the same i feel like it unzips the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my head and just butterflies and
rainbows and psychedelic colors and
[SPEAKER_00]: spirals and musical notes and all kinds of
shit just flies out of my head crazy ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: go into my head this is like psychedelic
really thought-provoking brain spinning
[SPEAKER_00]: almost panic-inducing weed for some people
and i really really do enjoy that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a time warp i can smoke a
little bit of jack tripper and i'll think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been five minutes but the next thing
i know it's been all day and i haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: done shit except scrolling my phone and
mess around in the house and not get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything done so i really like that kind
of buzz it's super intense for me um it
[SPEAKER_00]: just makes me it's got some blinders to it
and i feel like i'm just in my own
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking psychedelic world with it so
let's talk a little bit about the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: of jack tripper what makes up a jack
tripper plant this was made with a lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk female my lemon skunk female is from
greenhouse seed company um i'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: how much i talked about this lemon skunk
plant the seed i grew it from seed the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed was a gift to me from a person um in
probably 2008 i think i was gifted these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds do that i think it was my birthday
2008 or christmas 2008 right around there
[SPEAKER_00]: as when i got these seeds it was the pack
of greenhouse a greenhouse seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that come in the disc and i say they
look like birth control pills because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a circle and there's multiple seeds in
there and they're all different colors and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are all color coded to what strain
they are there was a strawberry haze in
[SPEAKER_00]: there or a strawberry yeah strawberry haze
uh lemon skunk there was an amnesia haze
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a few different things in this
six pack or five pack of seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse seed company and i had this one
seed of lemon skunk to grow and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing i loved it from all the way from
the beginning of the grow i could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: that this plant was going to be special it
grew more quickly than everybody else it
[SPEAKER_00]: had a great aroma it looked really
appealing so that is a lemon skunk from
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse seed company we're going to
talk more about that one as we go the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from this one oh also that is the
same lemon skunk plant that makes up lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: jeffrey just to give you an idea of some
of the flavors and aromas that will carry
[SPEAKER_00]: through that is the lemon skunk that does
make the lemon jeffrey plant now the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant i used in this mix is a jack the
ripper male from tga subcool seeds uh big
[SPEAKER_00]: up shout out rest in peace to my buddy
subcool i wanted to work with the uh the
[SPEAKER_00]: jack the ripper cross i was given
permission from miss jill to work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: jack the ripper and i made a lot of great
things i wanted to definitely pollinate my
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon skunk with it because i knew um did
i get to the goal yet yeah the goal is the
[SPEAKER_00]: next part um i knew that i wanted to make
that lemon lime dryer sheet turp sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and i knew that the buzz would be
fucking tremendous i was looking for that
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene turpentine turp and possibly
hoping that the thcv would carry from the
[SPEAKER_00]: jack the ripper some of the phenotypes
will achieve that although i don't lab
[SPEAKER_00]: test a lot of my stuff i've got to let
other companies do that other growers uh
[SPEAKER_00]: because here in colorado personal growth
can't lab test but i made it because i was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the lemons the limes and the
dryer sheet turp and i absolutely achieved
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll talk about that a lot i was
hoping for that extreme head buzz that
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy crazy head buzz that comes with it
and i got that both of the strains the
[SPEAKER_00]: jack the ripper and the lemon skunk have a
good head buzz this gave me a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: head buzz with some blinders it's like
when you put the blinders on a horse and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't see what's beside them that's
how i feel after i smoke this stuff it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also got a nice euphoric buzz to it some
creativity some psychedelic feelings to it
[SPEAKER_00]: a little floatiness to it if you smoke
enough i do enjoy that and that lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer sheet flavor is just you can't stop
that all right um more of the flavors i
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote down funky skunk lemonade lemon lime
candy limeade lemon cleaner and dryer
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets are the specific flavors and aromas
that i wrote down for this podcast now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the buzz i keep talking
about this psychedelia it goes straight to
[SPEAKER_00]: your head when i smoke jack tripper if
it's a dab if it's a bong rip if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint i feel it it goes into my lungs like
or however you're going to do it maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a puffco you just sit there and suck
on it but either way when it gets into my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs i feel it go i'm in here i'm in here
and then it goes it spreads out across my
[SPEAKER_00]: chest but then it goes straight up into my
brain and my eyes go they get all heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: and red and then i start feeling my heart
beat start going until suddenly it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like my heart is going and the best of
ways i like a good panicky weed it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit for some people in my
might be too much for some people i like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good panicky weed if i walk into walmart
or target or anywhere and i go huh this is
[SPEAKER_00]: great i'm not high enough i gotta walk
into target and go i'm too fucking high to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in here i need an adult that's when i
know that i did it right so i like that
[SPEAKER_00]: good panicky weed all right where were we
i had to pause for a technical difficulty
[SPEAKER_00]: i have regrouped and i think i'm back on
track if i do remember correctly i was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the buzz that i did achieve
from this strain i noticed it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: straight to my head sometimes it gives me
the wobbly eyes if you've ever been on the
[SPEAKER_00]: school bus or on the bus as a kid or maybe
even as an adult maybe in the car one time
[SPEAKER_00]: i leaned my head on the window of the
school bus and the tire vibration coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up through the car made it vibrate real
good and it made my vision go up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: like i was on a dirt road sometimes the
jack tripper will give you the i vibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the the dirt road bumpy vision it's
nothing to be worried about i kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it i like it when shit happens when
i smoke because i smoke so much that i
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta get some sort of effect like
something different and unique to really
[SPEAKER_00]: uh to really notice it i also i wrote down
that i get intense deep introspective
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts it's a very long lasting buzz and
it definitely has what i call no ceiling i
[SPEAKER_00]: call it no limit weed a lot of things that
i smoke i can smoke so far and get myself
[SPEAKER_00]: so lit and that's as far as i'm gonna go
it's got a peak it's got a maximum i maxed
[SPEAKER_00]: out i've reached my saturation point there
is something with the jack tripper that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no end
[SPEAKER_00]: i can just keep smoking and i can put
myself it's got the jack limon skunk pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: types and the jack the ripper phenotypes
you're gonna see some jack the ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: really close phenotypes you're gonna see
some lemon skunk phenotypes and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna see some perfect right in the middle
that's basically how it appears when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start breeding and making f1s you see the
mom the dad and everything in between and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also you may see some weirdos in
there some of those weirdos that pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: are very longer flowering phenotypes that
do get tall and skinny they're easily
[SPEAKER_00]: identifiable early in flower if you don't
want a super long flowering phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice those are the plants to
call the tall, super skinny ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not boys, they're going to take
a real long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously there's the lemon skunk
phenotype and the Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper, the flowers from the
Jack the Ripper phenotype are more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tighter, more compact bud
structure, more of a pine cone shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a long elongated, extended,
stretched out pine cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more lime aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk is less dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit more, I'm not going to
say fluffy, just not as tight and as dense
[SPEAKER_00]: and rock hard as the Jack the Ripper
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a phenotype that's a little
fluffier, a little looser, a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: airy, that is going to be lemon skunk
leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will also have more of the lemon
candy aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this lemon candy flavor isn't like
lemon peels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like straight up sour lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like if you had a box or a bag
or a jar even of Country Time lemonade
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just opened it and got a good
smell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soft lemon candy, lemon sorbet sort
of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what comes from this lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're going to get in the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper puts out a lot of that
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the lemon skunk dominant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk has, the lemon skunk
phenotypes have more node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice some of the phenotypes,
they go up and they curve to the right and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they'll make a node there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll curve to the left and make a
node there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a jagged left and right,
alternating pattern that is from the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice if the plant goes straight
up and spits branches out of the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: left and right, left and right,
alternating, that is the Jack the Ripper,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more classic plant look that you're
used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk grows up and it like moves
out of its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It curves to the right and then it'll
shoot another shoot out of where it curved
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll go up and curve back left
and make another shoot where it curved
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just goes straight up doing that
continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will catch up and branch out,
but it does branch a little differently
[SPEAKER_00]: than a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper phenotypes tend to
branch out more like a Christmas tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: more like that classic ganja plant that
you're used to seeing, that sativa leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa plant that you always see pictures
of, that is going to be the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper type phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more Christmas tree structure,
tighter node spacing, not as elongated
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces between the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll definitely notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got long spacing between your
inner nodes, that is definitely coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get that lemon skunk
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper phenotype is probably
more ideal for commercial grows just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's basically easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those buds are a little bit more
commercial friendly, more appealing,
[SPEAKER_00]: more bag appeal is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk pheno is connoisseur weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great herb, but it's not as
appealing for dispensary herb because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not as dense as a lot of the dispensaries
would like it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets thrown in the jar,
the bag, and treated like commercial weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and abused, the buds don't hold as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want the Jack the Ripper
phenotype better for your dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: for your commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making concentrates,
you want that fluffy phenotype all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype I like, it's kind of a 50-50
mix that leans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it can't be 50-50 if it leans
one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it's like 60-40,
the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the lemon skunk flavor,
the lemon skunk kind of structure with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper limes and potency to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, I can, I can spot both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it because I've worked with both
of these plants so much, but it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker stalk and it kind of does the
left, right, the shimmy, the shuck and
[SPEAKER_00]: jive, the axle rows if you want,
going left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant kind of does that, but it makes
long side branching and it branches out
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got the left, right, but then it
spits out a lot of menorah type branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get one giant major top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a moment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main stalk gets super thick and then
it almost does, I want to say almost,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like it's webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most cannabis plants, when they go up
and they shoot off another branch,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just looks like that branch is coming
out of the stalk and it just makes a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these phenotypes will do almost a
web-like look and it doesn't appear at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top part of the node, at the intersection
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens more at the base where the
branch comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to describe without drawing
or showing you a picture, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do my best here with the power of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, like I said,
the stalk will go straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the branch will come out at like a 45
degree, just sticking right out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that 45 degree, it just looks like an
angle there on the top and the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like you just put two sticks
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the lemon skunk phenotype,
sometimes the bottom part of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just an angle, it looks like
you kind of took a decorative piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: trim and stuck it in that angle and curved
out the angle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost, maybe the best way I can describe
it is this thing between your finger and
[SPEAKER_00]: your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just go finger, thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this weird webbing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants kind of do that as well,
but it's on the bottom part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making a seven, it'd be down
here is where that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that, that's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That passes so much of that lemon candy,
lemon sorbet, sort of a soft country time
[SPEAKER_00]: lemonade powder, lemon heads kind of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype with that webbing in there,
that's going to have that a lot in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to see long,
skinny leaves with long petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves stick out of the buds maybe
an inch, inch and a half, maybe two inches
[SPEAKER_00]: before you even get a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the phenotypes, if you do see the
phenotype that produces a small bud
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster on the petiole, so you'll have a
leaf, you'll have a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let's say the microphone's the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your big bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got leaves sticking out of the
sides, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm going to go this way so you
could see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some of the leaves will make a
little bud cluster right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: just on top of the leaf at the middle
where the fingers all start coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: where the petiole and the leaves separate
and meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little tiny nub cluster
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because that plant is super happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will do that when they were
happy, when they are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed a lot of Jack the Ripper
crosses do that when they are happy about
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things with Jack the Ripper in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed it when Subcool was putting out
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a lot of Subcool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would get some of his stuff just
right, it would put out those little bud
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters right in the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's coming from Jack
the Ripper is what causes that because
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commonality there, of course,
is that Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see those long thin leaves with
thin petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two different types of
leaves that come from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both long, skinny, very serrated
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the Jack the Ripper phenotype
doesn't have a canoe type shape to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that may be vague and hard to
figure out, but let me elaborate a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper has more of a classic
cannabis serration leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just got the five fingers that come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super skinny, but it just looks
like a ganja leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk, the leaf will get real
skinny at the base and it gets kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wider in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets real skinny and has a
nice curve to the shape of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper does not have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one good indicator of which way
your phenotype is leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that curved leaf or just a
leaf that just goes out and in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that curved leaf,
you'll definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper has much easier
phenotypes amongst this cross that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could pull out of there and have much
better success with, with less effort if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not as experienced of a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phenotype I love may not be the
phenotype that you are going to fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me tell you which phenotype is
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made this analogy before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've driven you to the Jack the Ripper
restaurant that you've got to choose off
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jack Ripper menu, which meal you want
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get this meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the same restaurant, but we might
want slight different variations in our
[SPEAKER_00]: entree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's up to you to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Skunk phenotypes are a little
more picky at growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I keep leading up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Skunk phenotypes are a little
bit more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper phenotypes,
simple to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Skunk phenotypes are a little
deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you upset them just a little
teeny tiny bit, the leaves will turn super
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the leaves will fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start drooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant just, it'll recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does well, but it just goes into
fucking panic mode for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just look at it wrong, if you fart
near it, if you sneeze in the grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the leaves might just come off of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's picky, but it is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medicine, the product that that plant
produces, the concentrates that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are so worth the extra work
that it does take.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper phenotype will take
anything you throw at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can scrog it, pinch it, pop it,
twist it, lollipop it, anything you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do to it, it will take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes defoliation very well,
but do not over defoliate that Lemon Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that looks more Lemon Skunky,
the less dense buds, more airy buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: those longer leaves, don't over defoliate
that one because she doesn't make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really wants the leaves that are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take them off, it will piss her
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do start pissing her off,
it takes a minute for her to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she does take a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't top the Lemon Skunk
phenotype, you get one giant, giant glory
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend topping these plants unless
you want to do short C of green plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend topping all of these
plants, uh, spread them out real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like a lot of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's prevent some mold because the buds
are going to get giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you don't top them, they're
going to get giant, giant top colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a room full of giant
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you do spread this out,
trellis, it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a bunch of giant tops
in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your VPD late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As these plants get larger, they will
transpire and respirate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be more moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to increase CO2, uh,
decrease humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to risk the, uh,
run the risk of getting mold inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: these giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do pay attention to your VPD later in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a Jack Tripper plant mold
up on me, but I've had some giant buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that have made me worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always reduce that VPD just a little
bit, get it a little dryer in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: get more airflow, pay attention to stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could top it, if you could spread
it out instead of getting one giant bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a whole bunch of buds amongst the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that if you're going to
go for just a bunch of glory buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow small plants and flower them very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me catch up on my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overwater these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do not like to be
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not like to sit in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes when I go out of town or if
I'm doing a holiday thing, I will simply
[SPEAKER_00]: overwater and just leave a little bit of
water in the tray so that I could buy
[SPEAKER_00]: myself two or three days more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do not respond very well to
that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get pissy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will fall off and turn yellow
on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that stuff to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get very, very pissy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these plants are perfect to top
them, scrog them out, fill a scrog net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find some phenotypes in here that
are beautiful for a sea of green method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get that one big glory bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim off most of the side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all that lateral branching out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cram a bunch of them in real tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pack a lot of weight in one room
if you fill it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these phenotypes are going to make
a giant baseball bat colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mom plant made giant buds and the
father plant made giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the other phenotypes of the Jack
the Ripper made giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get giant baseball bat
donkey dick colas out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some sort of
supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe some sticks, maybe some tomato
cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will need some sort of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get big and beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these phenotypes, if not all of
them, are going to triple in size before
[SPEAKER_00]: they finish flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to triple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got six feet of grow space and
you've got to keep in mind space between
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, I'm going to say that your grow
light is seven to eight feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you six feet of vertical space
to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you flower these plants
when they are two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're giving them proper light,
proper nutrients, good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take good care of them,
these plants will triple in size before
[SPEAKER_00]: they are done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect just short plants that are
just going to grow and finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you now, they're going to get
tall as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes do like to branch
out quite a bit, so possibly be prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for branchy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to take up a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be a little bit lanky on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes, that long lanky
arm, if you don't lollipop too much and
[SPEAKER_00]: trim too much up too low, all of that
space will fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all fill in with big fat chunky
nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't clean up too much of them on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I definitely recommend is flower
the first run early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too stuck on having a major,
huge harvest on your first crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus your first run with these plants on
just learning what they do and how tall
[SPEAKER_00]: they are going to get and finding your
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out how tall it's going to get,
then run it big the second time,
[SPEAKER_00]: third time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a relationship with the plant at
that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are super easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce a lot of large leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the sugar leaf on there,
all the small leaf, whatever you guys want
[SPEAKER_00]: to call it, in your location, wherever you
are, all of that leaf is going to be so
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty that if you're making concentrates,
don't waste time cutting that off of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a pre-harvest defoliation by
taking off all of the giant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf with a petiole right before
harvest, pull that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then chop down the plants, let them dry
for a few days and go back and just
[SPEAKER_00]: manicure all that small leaf off and keep
that small leaf and make edibles or
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates out of it because all of the
leaves on these plants are coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're super easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make amazing concentrates,
super delicious, almost panic-inducing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make rosin, if you make BHO,
any type of concentrates, if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing it, if you're making bubble,
however you do it, these concentrates will
[SPEAKER_00]: give you that straight to the eye,
straight to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh shit, man, I'm too high
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing's going on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just high, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like sweaty palms, sweaty armpit kind
of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like looking for your keys and
shit, but your keys are in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's definitely the kind of herb
that this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've talked about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about feeding
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've really noticed with the
Jack Tripper plants is they tend to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher pH than most of the
things I breed and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I feed my plants a pH
somewhere between 6.1 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up my nutrient, throw my pH pen in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like 6.1 to 6.4 is usually where I aim
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants seem to act better in 6.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was noticing something just wasn't
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just increased that pH just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not uptaking nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase that pH just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The little fuckers took off and started
eating everything I was giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it was potassium or
calcium that they were lacking,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of them was not uptaking in their
late veg phase, early flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I increased that pH,
they took right the fuck off and started
[SPEAKER_00]: eating everything I was feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no feed problems at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you're experiencing any issues
with these plants, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing, a little bit of slowed growth,
increase that pH just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience, I grew these plants,
most of my growth is usually in a soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super picky about the soilless mix
I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to buy, especially since we had all
these fucking shipping delays and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was weird and my local grow
shop closed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to drive fucking to another city
right now to buy soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy what they've got a lot of what will
fill my needs because sometimes what I
[SPEAKER_00]: like and what I prefer is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to be flexible and adapt to what
I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was using HP pro mix with the
mycorrhizae this time because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: simply what was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed it new millennium bottled nutrients
with a little bit of recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put plus life in there during
the boosting phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give it what's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always forget the name of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are yelling at their fucking phones
right now saying that product is called
[SPEAKER_00]: Budswell Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Budswell said the product I like to
use and then add some shine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some fulvic acid, some Ruby and
then a few other small things in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some green sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what I might be adding in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my soilless mix, I noticed they did
prefer a little bit high pH, like a six
[SPEAKER_00]: point six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem more green and just healthier
and more active at that higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants seem to like most of these grow
styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw pictures of these plants being grown
on a five by five table.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it when you flood to drain table?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just recycling the flood to
drain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had rockwool cubes on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants from the base of that
rockwool cube up to the tip of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants was just all nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants seem to like the hydro is
something that I'm leading at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like a humid room, but be careful
late in flower because the buds are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got that skinny leaf and they tend to
react very well to a little bit of a humid
[SPEAKER_00]: room, more humid than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be careful because you're going to get
big chunky buds at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants also like a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never burned these plants with my
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running Canon LEDs in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get these plants fairly close and
they have never been burned from the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do act very well and react
very well to just conventional light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually run 18, six or 19, five for my
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like 12, 12 or 11, 13 very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I noticed, they don't seem to
like modified or alternate light
[SPEAKER_00]: schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys notice I've been talking about
different light schedules on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that to Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't seem to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like moderate feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen in the flowering phase
will give these plants what I call the
[SPEAKER_00]: spiral staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this often.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, if you overfeed your plants
too much nitrogen in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to stretch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the bud starts forming,
it doesn't cluster up here and cluster up
[SPEAKER_00]: here and meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts doing a little bud here,
a little bud here, a little bud here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just does the spiral staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never stacks properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never meet up the way that they
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't form properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just from overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overfeed these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these phenotypes, they'll kind of
stretch out too much if you overfeed them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of them will get fingery and
foxtail-y and start making little nubs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds and little fisty shaped buds that
don't look pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overfeed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Tripper plants are going to take
honestly 10 or more weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not ready for a 10 week plant,
don't commit to Jack Tripper seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are labeled 10 plus weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at 70 to 77, maybe more
days to finish these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are done around day
72.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be later, but prepare for 72 to
75 solid days before these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say this a lot when I talk about
harvest times, but it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: let these plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants really do something extra in
the last week of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really put on some density.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really bulk up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're waiting for those trichomes,
they look like they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them time to get ready because
they're bulking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adding more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting better as you wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be impatient with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give these plants the opportunity
to finish, you will see right at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: they do bulk up and beef up just a little
bit extra on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that they do finish up quite
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that basically wraps up my
report on Jack Tripper, but I do have one
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail I want to address in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are shopping for seeds,
they often ask me what is the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between John Lemon and Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about both of these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've mentioned, Jack Tripper is a
lemon skunk female and a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of soft candy lemon flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit about John
Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sour diesel female and a BC
lemon skunk male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting a lot of that sour lemon
flavor, but there's also a funky diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main differences in these two
strains are going to be that the Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripper is more of a soft lemon candy,
lemon sorbet, Country Time Lemonade,
[SPEAKER_00]: gentle lemon candy sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The John Lemon is more of a lemon peel,
sour lemons, astringent, kind of a pissy
[SPEAKER_00]: cat piss kind of a funky sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gross, but delicious lemon aroma and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like that lemon candy,
I recommend Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into the pissy sour lemons,
I will recommend John Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say pissy sour lemons,
I know that sounds gross, but if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis connoisseur, you know how
delicious that really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my report on Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a pack of Jack
Tripper, of course you can get those at
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pack of Jack Tripper will come with
a freebie tester pack plus another bonus
[SPEAKER_00]: tester pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do promise you the one freebie tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not count as the freebies I send
with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also add extra shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I advertise you get a pack
of seeds with a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to it, that's part of the
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of that, I'm going to give you
a freebie shit just to surprise you
[SPEAKER_00]: because I like the look on your face when
you get extra shit you weren't expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
