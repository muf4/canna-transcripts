[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am recording on
what I think may be the windiest day of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear all kinds of chaos outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's coming through the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of software and toys and
gadgetry work in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some post production fixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize if you hear the the chaos
that is ensuing in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the thing where I just say that
occasionally here we just trade trash
[SPEAKER_00]: cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's that neighbor gets my trash
cans and I get that neighbor's trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just do the trash cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all shift trash cans to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like this week we're shifting two
or three trash cans to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just exchanging of the cans is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough rambling about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do hear thuds,
pops, bumps, bangs, they're well,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably there's nobody tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody detained here against their will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most likely what you're hearing is the
wind and debris pounding against the
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trash cans are going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trees are hitting the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some fun shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new rig and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My birthday was recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did allow myself a little budget for a
brand new birthday rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should have it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do some magical editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you may have been paying attention
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard me talk about it being
my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did buy myself a brand new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left myself a nice budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a, one of my favorite glass
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a few glass shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked around for a little bit and I saw
a rig that was not super expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's super caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like a rig that is super functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a rig that hits more than,
uh, lots of water flow and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the smoke to hit the banger and
then go through some water to cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want it to go to my lungs,
to my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a lot of movement and not a
lot of fanciness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a rig that function super well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will show you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will debut for the show the rig that I
have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is the color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't show up super great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell if the color is coming up on
the camera with the weird lighting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the post production here also may
post a photograph of this in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: feed, but if you're watching the video,
this color is called ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a light baby blue,
kind of close to the UNC blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a sneaker head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a, it's a bottle shape with a,
uh, it's got kind of a donut in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This donut, the piece where it separates
here actually works as a splash guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I pull real hard, I'll give you an
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I dab real hard, that water will not
splash up into my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we've got a glass rig here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a 10 millimeter joint on this rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig itself is by Brody glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, um, banger here is from DCS quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's really super deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds heat real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to keep this
cleaner than I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most of my glass from the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we've got a beautiful carb cap
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Bowman glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked this carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny is I pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed there's a hair stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said I was going to keep things
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened when I said it in here,
uh, this carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the air would travel through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd cap the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just show you where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes here so that the air can travel
through here, restrict the movement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: air through here, give you a better rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this nice handle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to hold it with these fingers,
put my middle finger over the hole to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of restrict the air a little bit better,
spin it around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these are both just a touch stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bad look, a bad dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be cleaning this much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, speaking of cleaning things better,
I did invite our friend Pedro,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Mr. Rosin's neighborhood, Pedro's grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin is legal fuckers, whatever you want
to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them my friend Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're watching this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ask Pedro to make us a quick video
on how to keep our banger clean because I
[SPEAKER_00]: did see Pedro complain on social media,
rightly so that somebody hit his expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: banger, stained it, left it dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I politely said, Hey, Pedro,
would you like to do a quick video that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can play on the podcast to show people how
to care for our expensive bangers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause those bangers are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the good quality stuff,
Pedro will do us a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my point was I wanted to show off
the sweet new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to shout out the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makers that make all this great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get enough love, enough credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, big shout out to Brody
glass, big shot at the Bowman glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, big shot at the DCS courts
for the awesome banger set up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then most of all, big shout out to our
friends at positively vibes for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, great love and respect and the good
deals on the glass and got a nice case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of glob mops, got some other
accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also had a great time in the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they treat myself like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat my, uh, my queen like royalty
in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you take your girlfriend to
places, uh, they don't talk to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only talk to me and they kind of
ignore her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make sure to include her and make her
feel included, which is important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so speaking of the new rig,
I bought a couple of new bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a turp slurper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a different style banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a taller banger, a shorter banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a banger with some, uh, I got some
turp pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a different carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still experimenting to see what kind
of banger I like best on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this banger a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's a little bit deep,
so I do have to get a different carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear the doorbell ringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're recording, apparently it's out
for delivery today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I'm learning, I'm adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've noticed is, um, with the new
banger and the new turp slurper and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, my heating and timing is a
little bit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm re-learning, uh, how long to heat,
how long to cool, how long I need each
[SPEAKER_00]: banger before I hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new, uh, new, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A learning curve that I'm going through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also I don't know that I like the turp
slurper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the turp slurper, uh,
I'll put a picture of a turp slurper and a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal banger up on the screen so you
could tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure I'm enjoying the turp
slurper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the restriction of the carb cap on
top of the bucket or banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turp slurper seems to, since the holes
are down there at the bottom, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: way to restrict them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I can restrict it and
get the dab flow that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my personal, um, experience,
personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to be sticking with the
bucket banger type style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure if I like the turp pearls
inside the banger or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new banger is a little deeper,
so it will require a spinner cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turp pearls for this to work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting the pearls in there and
using a normal cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this new cap gets here, I will give
you an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you it's going to freaking rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to shred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still learning how to heat it,
how long to heat it, how long to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking for a long time about
just heat it and hit it and you'll figure
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I'm learning is you're going to
have to kind of waste a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kind of let a couple,
uh, not get hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a couple of two hot
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to burn your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to roast your throat,
have fun, uh, figure it out and then take
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you're really, uh,
want to get critical, they do sell some
[SPEAKER_00]: devices that you can measure the
temperature of your banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it to the right temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people will make recommendations for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your banger to the perfect
temp every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a note of what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have an SOP for taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I in my notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure I'm convinced over the,
uh, the turp slurper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I wanted to
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I don't like that airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, things are really expensive to do
a lot of testing, buying a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: bangers, a turp slurper, some pearls,
a couple of different carb caps,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that really did add up quickly,
but it was worth it for the show worth it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the experiment, uh, for the
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will let you know what I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I get more things figured out,
I will do sort of an updated video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've done a dabbing video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about taking dabs,
but we did miss a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue cause that will
bring me back to what I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to loop around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also why am I so rambly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I so stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of my friends met me somewhere
recently and he passed me a three gram jar
[SPEAKER_00]: of lemon Jeffrey live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my day, my life has not been the same
since I got that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the new rosin and I have just been
slightly silly since that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friend for hooking
me up with the, uh, the lemon Jeffrey live
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the amazing aromas and flavors
that I love in the lemon Jeffrey were
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color, the texture, the consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Lee smelling it smelled so good that,
uh, my girlfriend doesn't take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, she rarely smokes ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just, that's just not her thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she'll hit a vape pen occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she decided that it smelled so good
that she had to take a little dab of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey and she really enjoyed her
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: She giggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: She smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: She laughed for a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's how good that shit smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me loop back to where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was at a store yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to go pick up some other smoking
accessories at a local shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a couple in there that was
asking the, uh, the person in the shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: the clerk, I guess, the, the person
working, asking a lot of questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing, about how long to heat things,
how to let it cool, uh, how much to dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get the dab into the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were asking a lot of questions and it
made me realize how much more I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to just pop in randomly to these
headshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dispensaries and just listen to the
questions that people are asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave me some ideas of things that I
could teach you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one thing that I want to recommend,
I am going to do another dabbing video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this, uh, just a moment ago,
I'm going to do another video where I
[SPEAKER_00]: teach you about different bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put a turp slurper in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't have a slurper in the last
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we'll put some turp pearls in the
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use a spinner cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may even buy a dab, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could use that as a, if I buy it
for the podcast, maybe it's a tax
[SPEAKER_00]: write-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get a dab, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or maybe somebody from dab,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or positively vibe wants to sponsor the
show and send us a dab, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some sort of a turp thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we can take dabs with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll teach you guys how to use that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you can get that perfect dab every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also we're going to talk about things
like, uh, nectar collectors and puffco's
[SPEAKER_00]: and dab straws and new things that are
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, um, there's other tech and other
things, other toys and other tools that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen now at the shops that I've never
talked about some things I've never even
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going there yesterday and having to
wait on the clerk to help that couple
[SPEAKER_00]: before me really showed me there's some
things that I'm slacking on teaching you
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will inspire a new dab episode to
come out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll learn a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a lot more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try not to make you wait until seven
10 for that, but that could be what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, uh, the episodes go by so
quickly and time travels really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what I'm saying is I owe you
another episode about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I want to make sure to say
right now is if you're buying a device,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a dab rig, if it's a, uh,
nectar collector, whatever you intend on
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking your concentrates through,
I highly recommend that it's got water in
[SPEAKER_00]: it to make some bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water and bubbles are your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were smoking concentrates,
we're going to heat these concentrates up,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's your, uh, nectar collector or
your dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hitting a nail, a banger,
a nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that one already, a Terp slurper is
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word that won't come to my brain,
whatever you're hitting, you got to heat
[SPEAKER_00]: it up quite hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't go through some water
and some filtration, it's going to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: roast your lungs, your throat,
your esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to feel super pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to enjoy it as much as
you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first recommendation, my number one
advice is when you're buying, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of smoking apparatus for
concentrates is that it does pass through
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this rig right here, it doesn't have a
lot of water and it's got this little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream, but this, this little bit of
water that really saves your throat,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, saves your lungs, your esophagus,
everything in between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes a much more enjoyable
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also when it comes to smoking devices,
I don't want a big bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a giant smoking device for
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a little piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea with the bong, you'd fill the
whole bong with all that smoke and you
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the carb and then the fucking smoke
all goes to your head and you get a big
[SPEAKER_00]: rip, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the dab, you don't have to carb it,
uh, that way necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't fill it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little carb work with the carb cap,
but I'm not trying to get fill it,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it, clear it, fill it, fill it,
clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going straight to the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the carb cap work in that action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need such a big device.
[SPEAKER_00]: A smaller device is better for dabs in my
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my humble opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my notes and see where we are
talking about the dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were going to jump into a
couple of these emails that I've got here
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, had to get new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get some turp pearls because the
banger was too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to get a spinner cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about spinner caps and
slurpers in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do understand how quickly things can
add up, how quickly it gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go spend some money,
do some experiments, and then I'll teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys don't have to waste all the
money is what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, always use water for filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, we'll do an episode
talking about nectar collectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: dab straws, puff co's, all that cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write that episode and get it out
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's the last part that I almost
forgot to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, solvent list episode part two,
big shout out to, uh, Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to my bro,
Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also extra big shout out to my buddy,
Roz and Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Roz and Ryan's, uh, premier debut
on a video podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting at is we did a solvent
list podcast episode, how to make Roz and
[SPEAKER_00]: at home where Pedro and Roz and Ryan and
myself discussed, it was mainly Pedro and
[SPEAKER_00]: Roz and, uh, Ryan talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about making Roz and we are going
to do part two of that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like from you is questions
for that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the Roz and a episode and whatever
we did not cover the questions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: still on your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me at grow from your heart
at hotmail.com is the best way to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're not going to email me,
if you want to be lazy about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw the questions on the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't take questions from
YouTube, but it's a, it's a quick way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave your follow-up questions on the
Rosin video that is already on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get Pedro to help us answer
more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get Roz and Ryan on to help us more
answer more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do solvent lists part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please send me your concentrate making
questions to my email address,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart at hotmail.com
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no carb hydrocarbon
extraction discussion on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that episode, I don't want to teach you
how to hurt yourself, how to blow anything
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to teach you how to do it
solvent lists with water, with pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit safer in my opinion,
also probably more legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't get any trouble for teaching
you how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where I dig
into this beautiful pile of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do get a lot of emails,
a lot of grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a grow help tab on the
website at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do ask you several preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we give you an opportunity to ask
your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a question that is not grow
based, skip all that stuff up there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top, type in your question at the bottom,
hit send.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those questions do go to my email
inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of questions and there's
all kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one of me and there are only
two episodes a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I haven't answered your question,
please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your stuff on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a good question here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Jamie,
and it even says, it's cool to mention my
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta, Jeff, I hope all is
well with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, smoking dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking lemon Jeffrey dabs out of a
brand new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, life could not get much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, feel good, look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm drinking kombucha, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you've been a great help in the
garden and a cure for boredom at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: tedious job at a, I'm not going to say
where your job is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you a little bit safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the dude's got a boring job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've worked in commercial cultivation
facilities where, uh, the whole day our
[SPEAKER_00]: job is to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I am the manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the consultant, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll defoliate with the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get on there and fucking try to go
faster than everybody else and challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they try to go faster than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Work gets done more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I do understand that a tedious day
can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put on a podcast, listen to some,
uh, Joey DS, some dude grows, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some Rogan back in the day and just
let them ramble right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love to listen to the Anthony
Jeselnik.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's the, uh, Jeselnik Rosenthal
vanity project.
JRVP.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to it, you know what I'm
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also anything with fucking Mark Norman and
Krista Stefano, I can listen to all day to
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, our friend does listen to podcast
to cure boredom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I'm getting you through a
long day in your factory job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I listen Monday through Friday,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably way caught up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I feel your podcast is,
uh, two above the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the two means,
but it's a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says two above the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being two above the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's a typo or if that,
uh, if I'm really two above the rest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it says being in a newly legal state,
I've been mentioning you to all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that are growers and they love the
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the organic growth of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't spend money on advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put myself in magazines or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pay for ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that the show grows is through
word of mouth from listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hopefully you told 10 people,
maybe two of those 10 people will tell two
[SPEAKER_00]: more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a snowball and avalanche effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope more people are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being that catalyst right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, uh, all of my friends
love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in grow shops where brand new
growers come in very confused on what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do and me and the store owner direct them
to your grow series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he said enough of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then he says, my friend that owns the
grow store, bro, thank you for the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments, by the way, I'm not going to
glaze over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question says, my friend that owns
a grow store is having major issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come and visit him a few times a month,
maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I am apprehensive to do so because
I do not want to drag them into my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is my friend and I don't think it's the
coolest thing to do to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about this today when I saw a
leaf all beat up while foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not spider mites, but it got me
thinking there are obvious precautions I
[SPEAKER_00]: can take, but being a new grower,
there might be some not so obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: precautions I can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask for your great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cool to mention my name from your
friend, Jamie, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how do we not trade spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your friend that owns the growth store is
having a major issue with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that funny that the guy that owns
the store that has every single product
[SPEAKER_00]: available to him that has every single
vendor on speed dial has not figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we eradicate the spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every product that he could imagine,
he can order it and he could get it and he
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably reach right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could read the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could apply everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could do something every other day if
you want it to, and he still hasn't beat
[SPEAKER_00]: the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like when they say that the
mechanics car is always the last one to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that the damn truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your buddy's got a major issue with
spider mites and you are apprehensive to
[SPEAKER_00]: go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, um, that's, that's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very wise move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very smart thing to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't want to put your crop at
risk by hanging out with your friend who's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a problematic crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, first of all, be a bro and kind
of encourage your friend to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: mites under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think of a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, bro, we've got to fix this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you own the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got better tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to beat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd help him develop an integrated pest
management strategy that will get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably 82 different products
there that he could use in a rotation in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction to knock out any fucking
problem really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's encourage him to get a strategy
to beat those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the hardest part in life is making
sure that you're making other people do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not even cool anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would just have, this is what you
should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a not should.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you what you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you what you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you could set up an integrated pest
management strategy that will outpower his
[SPEAKER_00]: pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're probably going to need
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you go to his place, if you go to
his place, when you come back home,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, change your clothes before you go into
your grow space, change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the shoes, socks, pants, undies,
if you can shirt hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be in there fucking shaking my
dreads out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd wrap the dreads up in a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to that crow or his house,
I'd come home, take off that hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: shake the dreads out, put them in a
different hat, put on different clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can rinse everything off and take a
shower, I would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on different clothes before you go
into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, all those clothes with the
bugs should be in the laundry room and a
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty clothes area, maybe already in the
washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you dropped them in the dryer so you
could heat them up and cook all the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, get rid of those clothes and put on
fresh clothes before you go into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take anything to his place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to go into your grow is what
I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next step as a responsible farmer
is to have an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're a salt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're a guy doing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're a hybrid style grower,
I don't know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would work on a strategy to make
sure you don't get those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, uh, pesticide rotation,
a sprayed pesticide application rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would choose two or three, three or four
different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe find a few things you can mix,
uh, apply those every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you start seeing a problem,
step up your game and apply every Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: and Thursday, I would rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do one product on Monday,
a different product on Thursday,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different product on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you only have three, start the
rotation over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can mix a couple of things,
mix two things, hit them on Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them with a third product on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do what I'm saying is they will
build resistance to the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit them more than two or three
times with the same product, they'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, Oh, I know how to take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw a left hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to block the left hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go left hook, right cross
uppercut, or some shit mix them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't know how to block you every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will build resistance, uh,
get in there with multiple modes of
[SPEAKER_00]: attack, um, different products,
different plans, different strategies for
[SPEAKER_00]: different bugs, but have a plan,
have a strategy, have a rotation of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, uh, keep your room clean,
keep your clothes clean, keep your tools
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, clean all of your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's talk about, you're talking about
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's getting the dreaded tobacco
mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another hoplite and Viroid is also
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how to prevent the spread
of the virus in our room between,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it's really hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can clean your scissors between
every single plant, I recommend cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors with ISO, uh, with rubbing
alcohol between every single plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cutting clones off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to move to another plant,
clean your scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we don't take the virus from
plant A to plant B clean the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: between clean the scissors between every
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, it's going to slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take time, but viruses will
take a lot more time and slow you down a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do the preventative work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're working in a rose,
if you're doing long rows, if you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow, maybe, maybe change your
scissors, clean your scissors after every
[SPEAKER_00]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the boss is going to get
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fucking cutting a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your scissors, cut a plant,
clean your scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time, but we don't want to ruin
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up after yourself and get a pest
management strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up after yourself, clean yourself
before you go in there and seal up the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the bugs going to come in into
that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you sealed all the cracks,
the crevices, the nooks and crannies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is there debris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there junk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there trash in the grow space that will
really encourage bugs to be around?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about, uh, if let's hypothetically
save it on the other side of that's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back there behind that just full
disclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody probably knows what's behind that
curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hypothetically say that's a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just it's not, but we're going to invent a
grow room back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that's a gross space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clean up all of right here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be no junk, no debris,
no boxes, no trash, no paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I wouldn't have it looking like the
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have it looking like the
basement where you got shit stored or the
[SPEAKER_00]: old drum sets are sitting where there's
especially like clothing and blankets and
[SPEAKER_00]: trinkets and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft things where bugs like to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wood things that smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wood doesn't smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wood is inviting to bugs,
things like dirt and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places where bugs and spiders want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have that type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a clean, organized, swept environment
that you can clean up and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no bugs, no pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little nook and cranny and hiding
spot is a place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they'll make a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got leaves on the floor,
they're going to go eat up those leaves on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as you disrupt those leaves,
they're going to go scattering in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess where they're going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go right to those fresh
green plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to head to the weakest
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start chewing up those
weak leaves on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the main thing you should do is
when you go to that house or that friend's
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, or even that grow store where he is,
um, remember he's infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you leave, don't take clothes there
that you're going to wear into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe have a separate set of
clothes to go see that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then when you go see that person,
change clothes right after, take a shower
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go into your grow space,
maybe have dedicated shoes, pants,
[SPEAKER_00]: a shirt, a hoodie, a hat, glasses,
and gloves, and whatever else you need for
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take that other stuff into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have dedicated tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't move tools from that grow area to
another grow area, to the outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the indoor, just buy the extra,
buy one tool for every space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need scissors and that grow that grow
that grow a pH pin for every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't move the shit around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just moving problems around that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then think about like just basic
pest management, seal the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't go on a hike and then walk into
the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic pest management will get you a long
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I've covered your question
because you basically asked how not to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring home those mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, uh, protect yourself just like,
uh, just like any other way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to say it, but just like
you don't want to get an STD, think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the precautions, things you need to do so
that you don't bring that stuff home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites are like the herpes of the
grow world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not bring that shit home.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen,
Chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been rambling long enough
to make this a successful podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to ruin it at this point.
