[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for putting up with my
ridiculously fun intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran myself out of breath trying to be so
enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to buy myself some breath catching
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you smoking on over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed it up lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing some local homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking flowers, are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sticking to flowers lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the local home grower for
doing the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some nice little local homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too fancy, but hitting the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to diss the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some crazy shit going around in
the weed world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have cookies or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into that fancy flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to listen to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the local home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who that dude is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fire herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gifted a little bit of it this afternoon
and made somebody really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love seeing people get happy over a
gifted herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am smoking, since you replied enough to
ask, I'm smoking purple starburst live
[SPEAKER_01]: batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a blend of purple punch,
Skittles, and starburst OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the package, the flavor is described as
spun sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is cotton candy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapes and shampoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy that shampoo flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shampoo is what stands out the most
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton candy and shampoo, almost like
strawberry shampoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's that old cheap strawberry
swab shampoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the back it says it contains 54 points.
[SPEAKER_01]: 84% THC and nondetectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging the purple starburst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starburst spelled with a Z, so nobody gets
sued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Z-T-A-R-B-U-R-S-T, purple starburst from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously got me stoned and it's
doing that shit to my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That passes through the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, when you're on the show,
something just makes us fucking ramble
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet if we were in school, they would
have separated us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not have been allowed to have
classes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd been like, those two guys,
we got to keep those two guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys coughing, separate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bad influences on each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the point of the show where we
should do some shout outs to a few of the

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for everybody that's

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to everybody who helps out Mike
and myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am working on freeing up more time
so I can make even better and more content
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money does buy time sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah, that is helping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it keeps all this fancy equipment
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys bought Mike's recording equipment
through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I should mention about Patreon
questions and comments and shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do promise to give people shout outs if
they continue to contribute to the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also promise to read their emails and
answer their questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have sent me a lot of
great questions and emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not realize that we are recording
several weeks ahead at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are three weeks ahead of
ourselves in podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to take a break and let us catch
up so that the emails are fresher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your messages are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not forget you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only read like three or four per show
and I probably get 25 per week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the math means that I'm always going to
fall behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means I've always got content.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the apocalypse comes, still got
emails to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to get to your message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get to your Patreon shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you sent me a message in June,
I just now, we haven't even gotten,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're already, I'm already recorded almost
halfway through June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be, I think you
understand what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain got ahead of my mouth,
but I think my mouth got ahead of my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, we're recorded ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't feel offended if I skip your
question, haven't gotten to your question
[SPEAKER_01]: yet, haven't given you a Patreon shout
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel slighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cancel your Patreon subscription.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that you got a whole month
of Patreon shout outs coming up if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: paid for a Patreon shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that covers that part of the
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I wanted to mention is today
I had the honor of recording on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Growcast with Jordan from the Growcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a fucking really fun chat,
a really fun chat, pre-recording and
[SPEAKER_01]: recording with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that dude is a great recorder,
a great podcaster and had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future, make sure you guys look
forward to myself on the Growcast with
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan River.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not already listening to the
Growcast, make sure you download that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's on Apple Podcasts,
and I think it's on most of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast servers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did agree to come be on my show on a
video format.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future, look forward to myself
interviewing Jordan River.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, if you'd like to tag team and join
in, you're always invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be a cool show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got the Zoom recording
mastered, man, the sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're really doing a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about podcast servers,
thank you, Mike, also for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to glance right over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom makes a lot better show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a lot more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a lot easier for me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good job to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to gloss over your comment,
trying to stay focused here and not Scotty
[SPEAKER_01]: real myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned Patreon a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the thing called?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Stitcher, a lot of people have notified
me that episode 371 is aired on Stitcher
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's only a minute long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have deleted, replaced, edited,
updated, kicked and cussed at that file
[SPEAKER_01]: and that upload service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same RSS feed that works on
iTunes or Apple podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same RSS feed that works on
Google podcast or Google play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything except Spotify runs off of
that RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is accurate and correct
except Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why Stitcher won't do it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher in this one episode just ain't
ever going to be friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can email Stitcher and it takes
them like three to 17 weeks for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really care because I don't pay
them anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hosting my shit for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make any benefit from
contacting me or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that episode, if you're listening today
on Stitcher radio and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey bro, I would have loved to have heard
371 because it's a great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I encourage you to check it out
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is Jesse and myself sitting at
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people have not seen Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what he looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can come see what Jesse looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to miss the Jesse episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some gems.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually messaged me today on Facebook
and he said, Hey, do you want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: another outdoor episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, fuck yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to get that recorded and don't
say an episode number at the start of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could sneak it in whenever and try to
fit it into the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I don't have to make everybody
wait too many weeks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you miss that one on Stitcher
radio, I want to call it Patreon every
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two logos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blend together in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you miss that one, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to everybody who emailed me,
messaged me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: My replies were short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm trying to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking fixed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to be, I tried to reply to
everybody, but after a while I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, I know and I'm, I'm trying to fix
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't fucking, it won't fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, we're just going to have to
live with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody got hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all live to podcast another day,
but it's not going to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll like the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me make sure I haven't skipped any
other notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the grow cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, people like the music that we've
been playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been playing at the end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you watch the shows cause
you're on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it feels weird to watch a
show we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end, I'm running like a clip of
it's a slideshow of strains of just weed
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also sometimes I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other day, I think I danced around
to a fish song or a Stevie wonder song for
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody asked me to show my
dreadlocks too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show my dreads in another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bundled up super tightly today,
but I'll show them in another episode at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are impressed with the music
that I'm playing at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we've got to quit doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotify doesn't like the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube doesn't like the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting the, this no, no,
no finger at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the company, the less cool that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bigger the podcast, we've
increased the listens, uh, audio and video
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners have totally increased by a
large amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting more notices,
which is getting us higher up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rankings, which more algorithms are seeing
us and now they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Messing with our stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm no longer going to be able to
put cool music at the end of the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless somebody makes me a kick in theme
song.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me music that is original,
I've said this before, I'll play your
[SPEAKER_01]: track at the starter, at the end of the
show, and you'll get compensated based on
[SPEAKER_01]: how cool your fucking track is and how
many times I decided to play it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a professional and you need
money for sure, send me a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're kind, send me some tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fucking give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say your name and I'll send you gifts
in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I was getting to is somebody
asked me for a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple people have asked me,
what was that track?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that track?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read a couple of short ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the list is really long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read a few of the most recent tracks
I've played.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to post to social media,
the full list of tracks, because I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: it written down since, uh, 4 46.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started writing down which songs I was
playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the full list of every track.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take me a while to tweet
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be like fucking 20 tweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many songs can I fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've really got the list handwritten,
take photos of the list and post that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save yourself a year's worth of tweeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the thing about that is this
handwriting is kind of, it looks more like
[SPEAKER_01]: book code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some people, it's not going to do
you any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like the DaVinci code shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not going to, it's just going
to be an artifact that doesn't mean shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, so what are those four
letters in a row mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just initials for a fish song
that nobody else understands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to need, they're going to
need, and I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, RHM is red hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama from widespread panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one that I put on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through five Oh five through five
Oh seven, it says shit I made because
[SPEAKER_01]: those three fucking shows were tracks that
I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just read.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start at five on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start at five 27.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five 27 was called fat Freddy's drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't write down details guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may not know either the artist or the
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wrote down enough to give myself a
reminder so that I don't play that song
[SPEAKER_01]: again for like another 10 tracks or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fat Freddy's drop that was recommended
by a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 28 was a Pearl Jam song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't remember which one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 29 was government mule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Warren Haynes, Matt apps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot remember the bass player's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a dick for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt's one of my favorite drummers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Track five 30 was the white mic interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put music at the end of that
because I think we high fived each other
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cut that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 31 got a lot of notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 31 is a song called bloodshot eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for my bloodshot eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not write down the artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say through the roots but I
could be completely wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hold me accountable for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you Google reggae song bloodshot
eyes it will come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a current reggae band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're popular right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it on Sirius XM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was cruising home one night and that
song came on on the reggae channel on
[SPEAKER_01]: Sirius on the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like that's a fucking good tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 32 is the Beastie Boys because I
fucking love the Beastie Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 33 was Damien Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 34 was fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better know fell on black days bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 35 was here comes trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is chronics and protege
is who sings that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 36 was say it to me Santos by fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the live track from dicks
at a show that I went to recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 37 was brass monkey by the Beastie
Boys because Jesse was here and he made a
[SPEAKER_01]: comment about the Beastie Boys taught him
that every picture is cooler if you point
[SPEAKER_01]: at the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when he said Beastie Boys at the
end of the video I left that part in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought I would edit that out because
the show was technically over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I left that short clip in and then I
played the Beastie Boys just to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 38 was boogie on reggae woman by
Stevie Stevie Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five 39 is a track that I made and I just
call it some reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really have a real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the tracks most recently
that I put on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I got the one you're asking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a while for me to tweet
all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tweet out the list or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show you guys the rest of the tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike I've been talking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even gotten any cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to talk about growing weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give garden updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's growing on bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's growing on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we might have borrowed that from
another podcast but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm marking off the things that we've
already done because I went out of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out that list homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give garden updates dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know I'm a fucking ganja grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to give updates when I've
got something cool going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently we lost a very important cannabis
soldier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool is no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool passed a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cried over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an episode about it but I still love
Sub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still miss Sub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub's still on my mind sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be the breeder, grower,
shit talker, podcaster, social media
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be that guy without a lot of
Subcool's influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool taught me a lot of what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I jokingly say that Subcool also taught me
a whole lot of what not to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy was fucking cantankerous and a
loose cannon but I fucking love the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of him dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have been here without him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Jack the Ripper seeds from a
good friend who was very close to Subcool
[SPEAKER_01]: who actually thanked me for my podcast
about Subby.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me some Jack seeds, Jack the
Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I germinated them right around 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are now under some Canon LED lights
in a 5x5 tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my tester area is what I've called
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's my breeding chamber for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a stellar stellar look in Jack
the Ripper male dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Jack the Ripper male is what I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted five seeds and I found a killer
male out of that pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a female that looks really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna breed very well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photos look sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are under Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken about cannons on a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants grow so vigorously under
cannons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have flipped to flower like a
week earlier because they're just taken
[SPEAKER_01]: off dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannons are killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the cannons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when a new piece of gear kicks
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the new lights and a new male
plant in a new environment and it's gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: me super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always passionate and stoked about
growing but right now I'm like new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also changed my mom and veg space to
Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only got one more flowering area to
go until we're all cannon out in this
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I may need to get some cannons and
my friends to get them growing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited about it bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right about pollination time for the
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't talked about the females that
are in there too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep my stuff kind of not super
secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like sometimes I've talked about
projects and then they failed and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, it's because I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it too much energy, too much hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it on a pedestal and I fucked it all
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a Jack the Ripper male,
a Jack the Ripper female.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an Arise female in there amongst
several other females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not several, a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're limited by plants here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half my count is dedicated to this
breeding area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some Jack the Ripper F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just for myself to make more Jack
the Ripper seeds because we got to make
[SPEAKER_01]: more Jack because subbies gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things in there,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be happy with what I put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your favorites is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some Irene genetics classics
crossed to one of Subcool's classics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be not the first time that I've
worked with sub stuff, but the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used his pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a serious Jack the Ripper fan and it
just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I stopped being a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stopped being widely available and I
cannot wait to see where this project
[SPEAKER_00]: leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the cookies and cake stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeners are as psyched as I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are because I get messages every time
I say it, they want testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the pollen is just now starting
to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need weeks to get the seeds done,
harvested, packaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're worth the shit when I grow
them, that's when I'll look to giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: out to testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to interrupt myself because I
said something a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that the Jack the Ripper
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said it got overran by like
cookies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That triggered a memory in my head,
an episode or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when because we're so far
ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called a few strains, hype strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently I offended a close friend
and I don't want to offend anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that a strain, I listed off strains
then I was just rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was putting words together and I was
like, this sounds like a hype strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said two words together and my friend
bred that strain and I don't want to diss
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no disrespect to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the show right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope, or somebody will relay the message
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really popular grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to, I didn't mean to offend
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all, I was just running names
off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, this sounds like a hype
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your shit's fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but love and respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't have any beef with any
breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all that shit is silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I thought of cookies,
I just thought it would be polite of me to
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and apologize to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said cake bomb was all hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cake bomb's not all hype, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cake bomb is all gas, no breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked a strain out of the thin air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pissed somebody off doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be more careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he wasn't pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he was like, fucker, you just
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, if somebody called a rise,
I'd be like, hey bro, a rise is fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: hype meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, oh, ouch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, fuck, stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like calling one of your kids a
fucking, you know, the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that little R word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hey, wait, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't say that word anymore, especially
about my fucking kid.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you picking on kids, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, I picked on your child,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but love and respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep killing it on fucking Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person I'm talking about kills it on
Patreon and on Twitch and on fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm impressed with your Patreon,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambling myself fucking all day long,
but the road's going to be too dry to even
[SPEAKER_01]: cover any cannabis topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: These rambles are brought to you by dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to dabs and also a big shout
out to our friends at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stitcher Error covered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you find the show on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really prefer you check the show out on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to get most of the
audience to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you may be driving and unless
you've got YouTube or Ed, you can't lock
[SPEAKER_01]: your phone and close your phone and put it
away or in your pocket or something and
[SPEAKER_01]: hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand you may need to listen on
Spotify or Stitcher or Apple podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if Stitcher fails you again,
there are backup options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotify is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other services that I will try
to get the show on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes, I had a technical issue and
I, dude, I didn't know that I knew how to
[SPEAKER_01]: make an RSS feed and solve issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt was sitting here and he's like,
why aren't you on Spotify?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is my excuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I could do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within 20 minutes, my shit was on
Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to take a couple dabs and get
the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've covered all of the news
and all the crap in the first start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only like 20 minutes in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got caught up with the do list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they call it housekeeping in the
podcast business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can actually move on to the
educational and entertainment part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to take questions from email.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a question, the best way to
get it to me, honestly, the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to me is through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for the appropriate tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've changed the pricing, but go for the
question answering tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign up, throw me your question on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Patreon questions go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously that's an expensive ticket to
ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to the front of the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next best way is to send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laugh at me cause it's a hotmail fucking,
but all the other ones get hacked and
[SPEAKER_01]: broken into and Gmail failed me once and
now I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hotmail bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you right to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember where I found this
question because I didn't print it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes me think it came from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that people comment on YouTube,
but it's more challenging for me to print
[SPEAKER_01]: them off because it wants to print the
entire YouTube screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I catch it in the email,
it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third world prop, first world problems,
white people problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really want me to get it,
YouTube isn't the place to send it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com is the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find this one on YouTube,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I wrote down was DLI question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me, Hey Rasta Jeff,
why are my plants drooping toward the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the day cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit before the light cycle,
my start, my plants, my leaves start to
[SPEAKER_01]: droop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they need water right before they go to
sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I do something wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really worried about their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you look like you might know what's
going on with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any input on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you looked like you really fucking
knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to get more space to talk bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this before and I'm eagerly
awaiting your diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you start to get droopy toward the end
of the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they'd be pissed if I gave them
Red Bull though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening is they have reached
their, he's got that mountain dude going
[SPEAKER_01]: strong for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: People only listening on audio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daily light integral is, that means the
daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had their amount of light that
they want for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your light is however far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically it bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, Hey, I only want this many you
moles per Joule today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a measurement of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about pars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: What matters is you moles per Joule and
they've gotten enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're starting to shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going, yeah, there's no reason for
me to keep fucking photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to let my leaves hang.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of take a rest and start
doing the functions that I do during the
[SPEAKER_01]: night cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the light shut off,
it's beautiful nighttime for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is why the plants are drooping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be thirsty, but most,
if it's happening like 15, 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes before nighttime, they've
reached their, they'd be the other
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms of thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be easier to diagnose than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing that does happen in strains
bred from my daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's something that came from the
daybreaker line, cause I cross stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: straight from daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made daybreaker F2s and a few daybreaker
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise was made in that batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that come from a rise also have
the potential to make, if you get the big
[SPEAKER_01]: leaved phenotypes of crosses that come
from a rise, those do have the potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be a little bit droopy just because
they're so big that like the plants don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have enough energy to keep that giant leaf
turgid and upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hangs a little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucker got big in the pre-98 Bubba
Kush used to make droopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, nah, bro, these leaves
are, the leaves are longer than my fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were like, I can't even keep the
tip going anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it needed a little bit of plant
Viagra on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just tired, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just getting a little plant ED,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think is happening for the
person who asked me this question is the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants basically need a nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could, and I don't know the
condition of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long your lights are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are on for 24 hours a day and
you're seeing droop toward a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: period of the day, give them some
nighttime, start introducing some dark to
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on an 18 six, maybe not,
because then they may be telling you I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're starting to droop that the end
of that daytime, they're starting to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you, Hey bro, it is almost time for me to
start flowering unless you either put me
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bigger pot or something changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be starting to get root bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be one of the reasons they'll do
that, but it's the daily light integral
[SPEAKER_01]: that is mainly doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put them into flower, you'll also
see that happen toward the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower or toward the end of the day and
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will also start to droop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really change the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to keep them on 12,
12 there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep giving them that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll pump out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those big old fat buds, but they've
already processed as much as they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing wrong with your plants,
but if they're in small pots and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: vegging, it may be timed out pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing I could recommend,
but if everything else is in line,
[SPEAKER_01]: just enough light, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, Patreon is the best
way to get your message onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the ticket to the front of the
line, patreon.com forward slash grow from
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also help out my buddy, white Mike,
patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to straight up say his name
because he signed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think his name is Craig Compton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, Hey Rasta Jeff, I ran across
your podcast and YouTube channel about a
[SPEAKER_01]: month ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to tell you that I am hooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad you took the bait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I really appreciate the way you
present your knowledge, your passion and
[SPEAKER_01]: your dedication to the plant and the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are all a 10 out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting 10 stars today,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Craig, it goes on to say, I'm a new
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love to listen to people who can
elevate my game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are now one of my faves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to educate and inform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really like is knowing that
somebody is getting educated and informed
[SPEAKER_01]: and enlightened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I threw a dart and I didn't know
where my bullseye was, but I fucking hit
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that feels really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody, an educator, a podcaster,
a producer, a passionate person,
[SPEAKER_01]: those compliments all mean a lot of shit
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's where this message gets really
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I almost spit my coffee on my
windshield the other day when you said you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to stop listening to your guru because
you started talking like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was on this podcast or
in a live feed or on embracing organics or
[SPEAKER_01]: in another platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while, I was listening to a guy who
was very educational and informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've got to educate myself
with more knowledgeable people so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can keep you guys educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get a lot of education sources so
I try to fill my brain with knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a fucking bromance and a man crush
on this fucking weed cultivator that I
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just filling my brain with so much
great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got an East Coast accent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't talking like the East Coast
accent, but I was using his terms and his
[SPEAKER_01]: ideologies way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I caught it affecting my brain,
affecting with an A.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was affecting my brain and my speech
and my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to stop talking or listening to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to cut myself off for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, no more of him for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, if you listen to the same
rapper for a while, if you listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: Eminem, you probably start doing the,
start doing the Eminem shit eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to fucking whoever,
if you listen to Metallica, you start
[SPEAKER_01]: playing fucking just too much of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to quit listening to this guy,
but this guy says, I knew immediately you
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about Kev because I am the
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me bust out laughing that he
has the same effect on you as he does me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's talking about Kevin Jodri.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to quit listening to Kevin Jodri for
a while, you guys, because I started
[SPEAKER_01]: saying all of his words, his glossary,
his dictionary, it all spilled into my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a bad thing, but I wanted to be
me again and stop being Kevin Jodri.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy knew right away who I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he has the same effect as he does
on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very fortunate to have crossed paths
with Kev about five years ago and became
[SPEAKER_01]: very good friends with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over that time, I've spent many hours
and days with him learning and laughing
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoking some great flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my mentor and friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank God every day for people like
him and you who make me a better grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I signed up for Patreon just to support
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to the day we can hang
out as well as bust out a fat dab or a
[SPEAKER_01]: fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, love, and understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he signed up with his real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Robert Gnarly on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, where else can we find him?
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't give us another spot to follow
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enough spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give him a good shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig Compton, thank you for the cool
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means, dude, this guy listens and
supports us while he's working alongside
[SPEAKER_01]: the walking, talking, cannabis
encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can't figure something out,
Kevin is who I would look to for answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy's standing next to him all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person still chooses to listen to us
on our little podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's flattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to let my ego swell too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting older and trying to deflate
and understand that ego, but it just got
[SPEAKER_01]: pumped up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just put some fucking oomph to my ego,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bad thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when the show helps people grow
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole point of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly the point of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently subjected to some online
weed forums and holy fuck, the advice is
[SPEAKER_00]: just as bad as it was in 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must have seen some comments I left on
a Facebook forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still seems like it's a whole bunch of
mediocre growers giving people advice they
[SPEAKER_00]: know is shitty in hopes that they'll still
have a market for their meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advice is that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: To know that there's people putting out
the right information and it's reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: its target makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay to be a mediocre grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I sucked it growing when I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sucked it playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sucked it podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take karate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fucking ninja.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, I took karate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sucked at karate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a white belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kicks were sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My form was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, after a few years, I was throwing
fucking head kicks in tournaments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to suck for a little bit at
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels good to suck at stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got such a good grasp on podcasting,
growing, fucking playing the drums that
[SPEAKER_01]: when I try to pick up a guitar,
it's like, this is hard and it makes my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to fucking get good at it and
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay to suck at shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you shouldn't do if you suck at stuff
is tell other people how to suck at things
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, if I go- Tell other people how to do
it worse to make your suckage appear
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What notes do I tune my guitar to,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you could have said F, R,
T, M, and Q if you really wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but instead- About seven,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking adulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You manned up and went, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, how many states have legal
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should know, but I don't remember off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you're qualified enough to do the
research and give me a ballpark answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could check and be sure, but- How old
are your kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: How legal are you talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and almost five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a fucking expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you should answer questions on forums
about your kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can chime in about legal states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut the hell up when it comes to tuning
guitars.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If more people took that advice,
the world would be a way fucking better
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only thing that,
I can't say that's the only, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the only thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the real issue that bugs me on
social media grow platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will say, my uncle's brother tried
to put this in his soil and it worked for
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll solve all your problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you just told them that
that's going to kill all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I hope you didn't do this yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I reply quicker and get my word in
before you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it worries me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all social media is pretty toxic
right now, but the grow forums,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to think it's that the financial
incentive because everybody sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: understands that there's a limited number
of cannabis consumers out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's selling the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody asks you for advice and
you're like, no, set it on fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: take it out back and kick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that makes your shit, even if it's
mediocre, a little bit more, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the advice is so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advice on other topics is usually bad,
but it's not like this bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be a more positive person,
but it's a good time to vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody posts a picture of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a minor problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first person says spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're paranoid about spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second person says thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third person says bad soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth person says wrong light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this person is spraying for mites and
spraying for thrips and changing their
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and buying new lights when really it
was too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and their plant dies because they
did 11 things to it on the same day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm like, please be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, my bottom line, my point here,
just be careful when you're fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: looking online for advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things that people will
say, go look at the pictures of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can't spell leaves with a V,
if they put an F in the word leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't fucking take their advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier with other topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, it's still fringy enough
that sometimes it's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper grammar is not always indicative of
proper knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite as obvious it is in
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: With politics, it's quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people start talking about impeaching
laws and you're like, do you mean repeal,
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more obvious than it is
in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually if you pay attention,
you take a minute and check two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable sources, you'll get the info you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be super careful if you're asking a
social media forum about a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing question, because 80% of those
answers are designed to fuck up your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're really designed
that way or if they're actually that
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to hope they're not targeting
to think you fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should move forward from ranting about
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, dude, social media, people
talking about feminized seeds and such an,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ignorant is the appropriate word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ignorant means misinformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an insult.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very ignorant about feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have frustrated me enough to where I
am going to do a full episode on feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and detailed on how I make them so
that it's understood so that people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: using the wrong terms and wrong
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it worked for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving all this terrible advice frustrated
me enough to go, okay, children,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you, if I know that the best
way to get one of my comedian friends to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell a joke is to start telling his joke
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're, you know, I hang out with
some of the comedian nerds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So start telling one of their bits,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just sit back and then I get to
watch them tell their joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to hear you do comedy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, we're super rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got no deadline today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into another message.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from, what did they sign it
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're writing from Prohibitionland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to even hit their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody sent me an email the other
day and it said, I am in PL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, bro, I don't, where's PL?
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibitionland motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, sorry, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking stupid if I didn't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Prohibitionland says like this,
Rasta Jeff, I love everything you do,
[SPEAKER_01]: brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing from East coast
Prohibitionland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep it short since you're busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, if you think your perpetual grow
lesson was worth money, then your breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons was priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I made a joke one time about my
perpetual grow lesson being worth a
[SPEAKER_01]: million bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I would have written a book that
would have been the cash cow right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've been listening for a while and
I'm glad you enjoyed the breeding labels
[SPEAKER_01]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of went over that on two other
podcasts today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that on embracing
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talked about that on the grow cast
with Jordan River.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fun topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, dude, I listened to it twice back
to back just for the A and B line lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will listen many more times for a
refresher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep clicking on it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me more listens and views.
[SPEAKER_01]: That episode is my absolute favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will spread the word about your
podcast to anyone who will listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't run off your friends by rambling too
much about it, but encourage them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes on to say I grew in a basement
for about 10 years and I had to stop for
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I started again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says why he had to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if I'm supposed to read
that because it's in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says now I'm allegedly in week two of
my week two a flower on my third attempt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got four New York diesel in a four by
three tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks good for this one,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen your past and I hope this one is
much more successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toes crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ja love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am fairly experienced, but this is my
first trellis grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got a trellis, a netting
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just installed my second trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a first one, hopefully spreading
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one kind of given its support.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I listened to all of your Scrog
lessons, but I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the questions come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it okay if some of my buds are woven
through the trellis or should I only be
[SPEAKER_01]: weaving?
[SPEAKER_01]: So only the branch material is touching
the trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am trying to keep the canopy super low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just worried that I'm keeping some of
the buds caught in the trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work on a 2500 acre fresh produce farm,
but I come home to a four by three tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is passion right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish every day that these rows were
golden goat or lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out from our friend out there in
East coast prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this for a minute,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I thought was,
yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your buds are going to grow into your
trellis occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the little nodules.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stick comes up and the bud branches
off of there and instead of it just
[SPEAKER_01]: growing straight, it happens to catch the
part of this trellis and it just grows
[SPEAKER_01]: around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going to have to cut that out
at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that did catch my attention
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that you're still weaving it
through and you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be very careful doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in flower far enough to have
chunky bud set, you should have already be
[SPEAKER_01]: woven up through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what got my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to read it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only be weaving or should I only be
weaving?
[SPEAKER_01]: So only the branch material is touching
the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that or listening to you read that,
it sounded like he was talking about his
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should he weave it through so that when it
starts to flower out heavily, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering material is off and it's mostly
stick hitting trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time on the bottom one,
we're going to clean off most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: branching and sucker shoots and shit on
the bottom net.
[SPEAKER_01]: We clean all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom net is only there at the end of
flower because it's too hard to get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: before flowering is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there shouldn't be buds on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud starts right above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell the guys bottom it to the first
net.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first net goes about 18 inches high
and we bottom up to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how tall the pot is and then the rest
of that gets cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no bud down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe tiny buds may grow into your net,
but that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pull them right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fall off when you start
pulling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when the guys run through the
grow rooms, Mike, and at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, we've got a bunch of little popcorn
buds on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that got caught in the
net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the little tiny buds that grew
on the wrong side of the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your second layer of trellis,
that is there to support the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to be leaning against
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're toppling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is when you get the
opportunity for that stick to go straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud starts growing up, the fence is
around it, and they are going to go on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong side of the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hard to prevent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see where the buds are going to
develop because you've got to shoot there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sometimes you just can't aim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little more chance to control
it than you do in a larger facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking four or six plants,
it's easier to micromanage each cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible to do it on a 20-yard
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cut them down, you're going to
cut them down to small buds anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun to look at big old donkey
dick buds, big old bananas, big old dildos
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed, but I don't want to buy those
because there's a stick down the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a drum stick down the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to buy a 5A drum stick
along with my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go to guitar center when I need
sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'll visit my friends at Dope
Sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dope Sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to show love to local drummers
and people that support you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my friend, Eric Moore has got a
drum company that makes sticks now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to show them love.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want the big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to cut it down, make it
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the end of the cycle, you're kind of
down making it smaller anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be too worried if it's stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do at harvest time,
you can cut the branch low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if your trellis is at one level and
the bud's grown up, cut below there and
[SPEAKER_01]: just slowly slide down and get the trellis
net out of there, the string, the plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: line, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just slowly get it out of there,
go downward and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you got like 12 or 14 inches
worth of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just exaggerating and hoping you the
best of luck, but it's only going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to slide down, pull it out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that way you won't break that bud
off of the stick and it will still dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: cure properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a major issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes harvesting is a little bit
more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, when it comes harvest time,
cut the plants out of the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cut the net down all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a commercial grower with a lot of
experience, Mike's nodding his head
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like your net is hooked to some
supports on the side of the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it free of those supports so
that the net flops free all in one piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of your buds will flop free all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple your harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to cut the buds out of the net
than to cut the net out of the buds to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super easy to go piecemeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get in a rush working with that net.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen growers cut other growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen growers cut themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when wind shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did a guy fall off a ladder once?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both holding it and one guy
tugged it and one guy fell.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this dude's working in a ladder and his
four by four tent, he's already going
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to drug test him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to drug test you if I catch
you in a ladder in there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the net down little by little around
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all in one piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you can get the plants out of that
top layer, then cut the net out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: take out the bottom layer, then cut the
net.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to recycle that net,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like eight bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please just fucking get a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the reusing that in the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two most brutal things to
reuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reuse the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take them to the cloth pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run the cloth pots through the
washer at the laundry machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do them at your wife's or your mom's
house because she will bitch at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do them at the laundry machine at the
industrial washing machines and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: run those cloth pots through there and get
one or two uses out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cheap and affordable, but some of
you guys are using the more expensive ones
[SPEAKER_01]: with the zippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go wash those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your plastic pots to, if you're in a
legal state and it's not sketchy,
[SPEAKER_01]: take them to the car wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just spray them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get the thing that holds the
floor mats in place on the wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: clip them into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray the fuck out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clip them in and spray them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you put them on the floor,
they're going to slide away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them up against the wall or put your
foot on them or something, guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray the fuck out of them and don't use
any detergent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do the hot water rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spray for a couple seconds before you
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in case there's soap in the line,
spray for a few seconds until the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, spray the line clear until the water
runs hot and clear.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want car wash in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are in a sketchy area and you
need to wash them out, the car wash,
[SPEAKER_01]: put them in the back of the truck face up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to load them and then
drive up to the car wash and then to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bed of the truck and hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you're hosing the bed of
your truck down, but you got enough pots
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're packed up to where you can
just do it in the bed of the truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, how long have we been at this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are like fucking secret tricks right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just telling somebody about the old,
you can rig an electric car door opener.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little fob openers, you can rig those
to block like a bedroom door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if your landlord comes by
unexpectedly, they can't get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: second bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling somebody about that trick
last night and they're like, holy fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: where'd you learn about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh dude, that was a high
times trick when I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly I saw one of the coolest,
most stealth grows in a Denver apartment,
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly maybe recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking, I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you guys in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting on the couch on the opposite
side of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And didn't know it existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to my friend who knows what
he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for a while, but we've
got one more message from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this person is a Grow From Your Heart
podcast supporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're an iRegenetics supporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They support Rasta Jeff and all things I
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also members of the DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to this person for
being an awesome cannabis soldier,
[SPEAKER_01]: big supporter of the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Rasta K.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a message from Patreon from
Rasta K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Rasta K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who calls himself Rasta,
whatever, is a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for sex on Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever sent a message
with the words waiting for sex in the
[SPEAKER_01]: subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with your Google searches in the
future, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, waiting for sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, what up grommies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though this community, I thought this
community could help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I switched over and Arise five days ago to
1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the flowering cycle because the
question is, is there a specific point,
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, that's the word, specific point,
not pacific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to say specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific point that would show
sex first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did top it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would the pistols or sacks show up
higher on the plant or lower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is this all random?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long ago did you top it before you put
it into flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping you gave it seven, 10,
maybe 14 days to recover so that the oxens
[SPEAKER_01]: and cytokinins can run back to the tips of
the plant and try to fight over apical
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you did that too late to fucking
worry about it at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to make too big of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would have gotten bigger, fatter buds had
you let it recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I thought they were asking what
timeframe it will show sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to say 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, location.
[SPEAKER_01]: What specific point?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the plant, will it show sex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the very tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the tops are going to be the most
indicative points of the plant to find
[SPEAKER_01]: sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll start seeing, if it's a female,
you'll start getting the little pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a male, you'll start seeing little
nubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually those nubs will turn into
little ball sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top is probably the best place to
look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you've got an area that's getting
really shaded, that area may develop into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the male plants will show you a
little lower down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start popping off just one or two
sacks that are really extended because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to reach for the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically the tops are going to be
where you're going to see sex first
[SPEAKER_01]: because the male plants grow taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, what I've experienced,
the male plants generally grow taller than
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a batch of the same
strain, a batch of whatever seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat seeds, that's not a good
fucking selection because that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males typically grow just a ratio
taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what size pots you're using,
but it's going to be noticeably taller
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to make pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now pollen needs to fall down onto the
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tops are usually where they want to
put their pollination parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their sex glands go up to the top so they
can catch that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was down lower, it would get
intercepted by leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd get blown away by the wind by the
time it got to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tips, that's where their vaginas
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vaginas are on the tips, mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where they start off first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wants to get pollinated up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are checking for males and
females quite often, not a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's phenotypical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get some mutants and some
freaks and some champions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually if you run a pack of seeds,
those plants, they get super tall right
[SPEAKER_01]: away or generally going to be boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the urban legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more we ran, I thought that was
funny that that one held true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of believed it from the beginning
because it's got a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a reason in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not actually true, that sounds
true as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true in my experience for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the boys want to get up there and
drop pollen down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the boys are lower, you can't pollinate
the top bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do the short guys ever get to fuck the
tall chick?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple of times I popped seeds,
I got really excited over the super
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time it was like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant's got a heart on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell a lot of people, like that one
you're excited about, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, don't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, I'm not jinxing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's a foot taller than the
rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why it's more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Adam's apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, this was a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for like, I think close
to an hour, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote it down on another page of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know where it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for close to an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's start wrapping up this
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people deserve this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last episode, I was off my
game, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it again and I was like,
it's not as bad as I felt like it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was just a little bit off my
crackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might want to look at the last episode
we recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about being a little recorded
ahead in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't feel like we're giving away any
movie magic secrets, but we were in rare
[SPEAKER_00]: form for an episode, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what I'm talking about,
it might've got edited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't much editing to be done,
but I think we may have had too many dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: for a podcast that night, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got carried away before the show a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also like two in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should always has an effect on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late night podcasting from the bunker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a good time, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The late night bunker sessions,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't pay a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to pay them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made possible by zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

end of the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: A Mike's moment.
