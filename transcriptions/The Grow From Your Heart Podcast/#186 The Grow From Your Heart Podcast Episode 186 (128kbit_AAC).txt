please forgive me.

my buddy Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming here for the second time
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little computer issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps if you press record.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not really what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we got the computer going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dab out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring you our cannabis cup review show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a fucking amazing 420 this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys had as good of a 420 as we
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your 420 was half as cool as mine,
you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn on the music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get down to business here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of ads to read before we
can talk about the cannabis cup.

pleasure to see you again, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meet up with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your 420 weekend, Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted you to have some input,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Met some of my heroes in the community,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_12]: We partied it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did partied it up, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people liked our dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was very... Honoring?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be perfect work, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if honoring is actually...
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's a word to say.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was trying to think of a real word.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it is, but sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are here for dabs,
not English class, which is cool,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we get a little ridiculous on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we went to the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the High Times US Cannabis
Cup in Denver, where anybody 21 and over
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to hang out freely, smoke
cannabis with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs were available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were having a grand old time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first day, I guess we'll get kind of
into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first day we got there, we stood in
line for two hours, which sounds like it
[SPEAKER_01]: would suck, but to tell you the truth,
man, that was kind of... It started the
[SPEAKER_01]: party just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to hang out in line with a bunch of
cool people, just hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were dabbing in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of kind of reminded me a lot of my
old school fish tour, widespread panic
[SPEAKER_01]: tour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we used to just hang out in
the lot all day and make friends and get
[SPEAKER_01]: down, kind of do with what you had there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a good time, met some cool
people, did some dabs, smoked some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met people from seven or eight
different states just while we were
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging in line for two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shout out to my buddy Sammy for a little
bit of help there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed some help for a minute,
and Sam helped us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Sammy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the weed nerd crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, there was no drama at the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see any ridiculous, like crazy
drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw one girl look like she was having
a...
[SPEAKER_01]: she might be passing out kind of a moment,
and they had to kind of put her in a
[SPEAKER_01]: chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the scariest shit I saw all
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, people seemed to behave
themselves and take good care of
themselves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev agrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... Exactly correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they really, really improved the
Cannabis Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, it was crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot of people saying they were
having panic attacks because it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: too damn crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, you were able to move around
you were able to get to the booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave out a pretty nice map.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told you where who was, who was on
first, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even gonna go down that rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a really cool improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a vegetarian food option that
I could find, but I guess that's my own
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to complain about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could find some vegetarian food
there, it would have been in a way basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had ice cream for lunch, which kind of
made me feel like shit by the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only gripe, I guess,
with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worth it because I got to see all
of my friends, old and new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to list all the people that I
saw there and say hi to everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: this show would be four hours long because
Kevin and I, we spent more time just
[SPEAKER_01]: stopping and saying, Hey, what's up,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got through the first day and it was
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We roamed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were only there for a couple of minutes
before we started bumping into people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it rained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody sought shelter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran into this little building and that
cleared out a lot of the large chaotic
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd for the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin and I felt like we had a lot of the
place to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like it was mostly the crew,
people that had a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up walking through and this guy
named Swerve Swerven, he's the owner of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cali Connection, he calls us over to
his booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought he wanted to chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually wanted to hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He invited us to the back of his booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up hanging out with Addison
Demora.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Hunt was there, Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this dude named Darby Holm showed up
with a case of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin and I, I had to hide my stoner
boner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting a little out of control
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That glass was some of the most beautiful
glass I've ever seen in person.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to dab out with Darby Holm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dabbed with the Steep Hill crew and the
Cali Connection crew and Adam Hill,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was kind of an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys don't know who Adam Hill is,
he kind of inspired part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a podcast a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: In stoner time, it was a long time ago,
but he had a podcast and it kind of got
[SPEAKER_01]: shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started his own thing and he just
recently got re-added to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Getting High with Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't promote other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weird, but that's my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's part of what inspired us to do what
we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody that I saw this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I can't start to list off the people
because I feel so bad because I'll leave
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mentioned the Cali Connection crew,
all the seed companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hang out with Gage Green,
Alpha Chronic, La Plata.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to miss a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sin City was there.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Oil Slick booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oil Slick boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always great to see the Oil Slick
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are some of the funnest kids in
the business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Nicka.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was selecting Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave Nicka T.
[SPEAKER_01]: a pack of seeds and in return he gave me
some cannabis capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a family member in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pops needs some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do everything we can to get
Pops back on his feet and super healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a bunch of cool people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to say what's up to all those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we saw you and shook your hand,
dude, we're saying what's up to you right
[SPEAKER_01]: now because we don't want to leave anybody
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to wait a little longer to get
into this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who was there that we never saw?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny Cush, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That girl was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was the most popular girl at the party
and she wasn't even there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was not even there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love to Jenny Cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk a little more about
that lovely lady later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, what was your favorite booth at the
Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm biased as shit, but the Cali
Connection booth was my favorite booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did spend a little bit of time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to throw some music in the
background.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't think of the name of the booth and
I forgot those guys' name already.
[SPEAKER_12]: The place where I bought both my rings.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those guys were so cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: They had my favorite glass at the place
other than Darley Holm's little personal
[SPEAKER_12]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some amazing glass there this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some tight stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a moment that you'll never
forget from this Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_12]: The moment that John Hunt dabbed at,
I think it was that lemon mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: He had a big old huge grin and was like,
yeah, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grammy Gatsby likes the hash that Kev
makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an honor because those guys get to
smoke a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they get to definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Addison hit it right afterward and did a
very similar reaction.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the one that actually pointed me out
to Darby's glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was like, show me this ring.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that was a huge honor just to be
invited to hang out in the back of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali Connection booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how we managed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Saturday was chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was controlled chaos, but Saturday
about 3.50, I realized 4.20 is creeping
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should find a nice spot to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a hectic place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a state fair based around weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean to downplay it,
but you got your booths, you got all your
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors lined up, and there's a grid of
people just rushing left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's trying to get from place to
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to find a nice cool spot to take
some dabs for 4.20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something in my mind said that Cali
Connection booth had two really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: couches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wandered towards there, and we could
see from one angle that those couches were
[SPEAKER_01]: completely empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there happened to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Sunday, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was actually 4.20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we wanted a nice spot for 4.20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you're playing with that piece of
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean like pick it up and make like a
nice couple of dabs for us with that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm gonna.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left that shatter on the table for the
weekend, and I think it cured itself up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sunday, by the way, it was Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying the wrong day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday we're cruising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We end up over at the Cali Connection
booth, and there's this big dude blocking
[SPEAKER_01]: the way, and he's a big biker guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he must have recognized us from being
there earlier, because he goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys need to get back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, yeah, man, I need to get right
into that booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he moved out of my way and kind of led
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pushed the crowd out and led me and Kev
right into the back of the Cali Connection
[SPEAKER_01]: booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the guys who works at Cali
Connection, I don't know your name,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I knew who that dude was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of a tall dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got kind of dark skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was wearing boots and jeans and a hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy is a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you're listening to this right
now, dude whose name is not known,
[SPEAKER_09]: hit us up and let us know your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll see you next time,
definitely, because that guy saw us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He saw us coming, and he was like,
oh, man, get back in here, because this
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd's getting thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he let us grab two spots on the couch,
and we dabbed out the Cali Connection crew
[SPEAKER_01]: for 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Hill was working his ass off,
getting shirts and merchandise to the
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd, hyping up the crowd.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were hustling.
[SPEAKER_12]: And doing dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was trying to keep them
dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always swear, even Adam Hill,
those guys have done me a couple favors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, let's go dab them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave us a spot to chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a true honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people hate on those guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we keep mentioning that,
but it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sticks out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, if you play a sport,
imagine the biggest star.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you play basketball, imagine Michael
Jordan inviting you into his house and
[SPEAKER_12]: play basketball.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then him love your shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what it was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like stoner boner moment the
whole entire weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to like, you know, you've arrived
when you walk into the cannabis cup and
[SPEAKER_01]: all your fellow breeders are ignoring
customers to come run over to you and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to you for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is quite neat.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a neat thing to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really enjoyed getting all the ceramic
products that were out and about.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have been thoroughly impressed with
those ceramic products.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't sure if I would be, but I have
been very impressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you all get your hands on some
ceramics or know somebody who has one,
[SPEAKER_12]: give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_12]: And see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week or the next episode,
whenever it is, will probably be the start
[SPEAKER_01]: of next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to actually, I'll have you
bring over your ceramic and we'll do a
[SPEAKER_01]: little review on the show and we'll see
how you think a week later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm curious about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed kind of clean when we took dabs
off it, but I'm a little partial to the
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid I'm going to break that
ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my biggest fear.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I don't want to take it around.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your personal
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for some more music here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I want to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to play it off of this way
than doing it the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play a little bit of task
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun seeing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little, a great vibe for the
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it that YouTube plays commercials
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my favorite part of the cannabis cup,
collectively, I think would be just the
[SPEAKER_01]: unity that I felt, the welcomeness and the
unity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt like we're actually,
we're getting somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been going to all these
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working our asses off.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't see what the hash company is
doing, what the seed breeders do as much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're finally getting some respect
from our peers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just a couple of punk kids from
Pueblo and it's good to be accepted.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It felt like it was all just one,
it was all one around there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like no matter who you were or where you
were from or whatever, I always kept
[SPEAKER_12]: thinking everyone was from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: I kept forgetting.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was tons of people there from other
places.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there was somebody there from every
state.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say every state.
[SPEAKER_12]: I kept forgetting though, just because of
the attitude and the vibe everybody had,
[SPEAKER_12]: it was all the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was just like everyone was from the
same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big love to miss Nadia dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening, sweetie, thanks for
the hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing some dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend said that Colorado hadn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a little technical glitch in
the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope everything's legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks fine here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: But miss Nadia dabs Facebook saying that
she wasn't having a good time in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: and that there weren't any good dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kevin and I stopped by her booth and we
corrected that issue quite promptly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She looked very happy when we left.
[SPEAKER_12]: She mentioned something on her Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: She might've said that those were the best
ads she had in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: She posted your rig and your Chewbacca and
mentioned the dabs in the comment,
[SPEAKER_12]: which was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up to Nadia dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to follow some gorgeous
women on Facebook or Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's miss Nadia dabs and she's miss Nadia
Nawar on Instagram, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: She used to be the tiny rebel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She changes it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people may know her as one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Facebook and look for Nadia
dabs, you'll find her that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got a fat plug from us,
miss Nadia dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grab my rig here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching this dab for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 14 millimeter highly educated flux
nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shameless plug there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit the duality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand new duality bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seasoned to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I seasoned that sucker just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got it perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: My boy Task Rock taught me really nicely
how to season a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk for a minute about something
while I take a dab of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are at the cannabis company,
you saw me and you've got pictures,
[SPEAKER_01]: tweet those please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram them, tweet them, tag me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good laugh bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was some fun shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't think I would have that good of a
time, but for me personally, anytime I
[SPEAKER_12]: walk into a spot and see red tearing and
Charles chilling, I usually just pop a
[SPEAKER_12]: chair up next to him.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's usually a pretty good day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Much love to Adam Dunn in the hood lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a cool little after party you
guys threw there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They always throw fun, chill little
cannabis parties.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're always fun and chill and complete.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a nice little get together that
happens at the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you in my headphones, but you're not
showing up on the computer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guys, I apologize if there's some
bullshit technical issues in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computer might be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just give it some excuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure the computer enjoyed four
20 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kevin and I went to this little
restaurant in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Siri took us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the cherry tomato and it was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no key and I would recommend it to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_12]: The price was reasonable.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The waiter was super cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever the waiter's name was,
that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_12]: There were some cute waitresses that
worked around there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So go check that place out if you're ever
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some updates available from
my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this episode is a little bit
sketchy, blame it on Mac trying to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: force some updates on me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was funny at that restaurant
because everybody, not everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the folks in there looked like
they were on dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was guys in collared shirts with their
hair really nice and some smoking ladies
[SPEAKER_01]: in that place, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody looked like they were on a
nice fancy date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was us, our two high asses
in black hoodies, baseball caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's got like 20 pins on his hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure we just reeked of dink.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just came from the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody even acted funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody said a word to us about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all treated us really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to grub and it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, my hotel, I got to my hotel the
first night and before I walked in,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smelled like a fucking dispensary in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just reeked of sticky dink.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could hear as I walked down the hall
to my hotel room, I could just hear people
[SPEAKER_01]: choking and coughing all the way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was freaking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, oh sorry, I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big sign saying that you can't
sell cannabis in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal to display or purchase
cannabis in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about all kinds of
Colorado state laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every corner I went to had another poster
that was worded differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was funny, but nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dabbed the shit out of that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dab worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice sounds funny in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking funny to me.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to play a commercial because
I'm not sure that this is recording
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hang out for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do an ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This portion of the I Grow Culture podcast
is brought to you by Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil Slick, tools to help you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out oilslickpad.com for more
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we fixed all of our technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having too much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we took a little break, took a
couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a commercial going for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everything's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hate to break up a show like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it's time to read the winners
of the High Times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten to that part yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a lot about the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rambled on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the High Times Cannabis Cup,
this is actually a High Times 40th
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy birthday, High Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are getting a lot of free ads
from me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to all the winners and
people who placed, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I need to turn down some Task Rock
just a tiny bit, and then we'll announce
[SPEAKER_01]: some winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did a lot of awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to read you the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did two separate categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the medical and the US
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical competition was only available
to, of course, medical dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US competition was available to anyone
18 and over that could afford to enter and
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like doing so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best medical hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrid is not indica, not sativa,
but a nice blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be more than 70% leaning either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So third place, best hybrid, best medical
hybrid, Golden Goat from the Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Chem Crush from Lakantis.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place, Pure Power Plant from Good
Meds Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your best hybrid, Pure Power
Plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the US competition, the best US
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place, Cinderella 99 times white
from Natural Remedies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, best US hybrid was Colorado
Kim from Cannibals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first place US hybrid was Cookies and
Cream from Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big surprise to see the word cookies
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies like to win awards.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, side note, I'm surprised we did
not see Kyle Cushman this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see him or see him at the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was even more surprised that I did not
see him on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't win anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see him there, but I was even
more surprised that he didn't win
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was usually we see Kyle Cushman on
stage a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the winners had some TGA stuff in
it though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we'll move on to the Sativa
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best medical Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place, Cherry Pie from the Clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cherry pie is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't shop at a lot of dispensaries,
but if I had to go to a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: the clinic would be one of the very few
places that I would go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place, Cherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best medical Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Durbin Poison from Denver
Relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, another impressive facility
and another impressive strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very few places that I really
like to shop that, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my own, you know, I've got my
hookups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to go shopping, but Denver
Relief, they've always been a great spot
[SPEAKER_01]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go get that biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it was the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first place, best medical Sativa in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was Jilly Bean number one from Standing
Akimbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out Jilly Bean, TGA Subcool
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Sativa in the Medical Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me find more music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna play more task.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be something on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's playing, I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going, see?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place was Twista from the Green
Solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Super Silver Haze from Life
is Good Healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked some Super Silver Haze,
if it's known properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then first place was Ghost Train Haze
from Green Man Cannabis, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool because that's our friends at Rare
Dankness, which is a Colorado brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always like to see fellow Coloradans doing
good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were suffering what they were calling
the Colorado curse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare Dankness wins cups everywhere they go
except Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past couple years, we've seen Scott
from Rare Dankness have a look of
[SPEAKER_01]: frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the event and they finally
broke free from the Colorado curse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations Rare Dankness and Green
Man Cannabis with your Ghost Train Haze
[SPEAKER_01]: victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Best Medical Indica is where we are
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place, Best Medical Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver Maple from Ballpark Holistic
Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about the dispensary
or the strain, but we should check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Rascal OG from Colorado
Alternative Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal OG is always been a tasty fucking
dank-dank strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cam has always been one of the few
dispensaries I would shop at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be probably the clinic,
fucking Denver Relief, Cam, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind Love are like the four or five,
four places I'd shop at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several branches of the clinic,
so I'd go to one or two of those if I had
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rascal OG from Cam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then first place, Best Medical Indica
would be Larry OG from MMJ America.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a collab with Cali Connection and
MMJ America.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see Larry OG taking more
awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dank-ass strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, Best U.S.
Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I'm all dabbed out of my throat
as reflecting such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So third place, Best U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: MK Ultra from the Green Solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that dispensary, but MK Ultra
is definitely a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OG Kush and G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is, OG Kush and G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a nice little mix there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Grand Daddy Purple from
Cannibals.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are gonna hate on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never liked purple weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the color purple, but strains that are
from the purple line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always tastes, it tastes like CBD to
me, I guess, is what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never been a huge fan of that CBD
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: To each his own, you can hate on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like, that's at I Grow Culture on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place, Best U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: South Central L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: from Colorado Alternative Medicine and
Root Cellar Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: South Central L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: from Cam and Root Cellar Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Root Cellar Seeds gave Cam some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cam grew the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called South Central L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: and it won Best U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, got a couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's Choice Cup, this is for Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third place, People's Choice Cup,
which is the people voted on this
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place, K1 Shatter from New Age
Medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Jilly Bean Shatter from 710
Labs, Bud Med Health Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything with that Jilly Bean flavor,
Tangy flavor, Grapefruit flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take another dab, yes please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is always so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, let me read first place,
and there was a lovely lady, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: your name, we bumped into you close to the
end of Sunday night, and you gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: little parchment with this Grapefruit dab
in there, and there were probably three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four dabs of my size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap, honey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some delicious dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted a lot of cool things,
and so far this is the one I've enjoyed
[SPEAKER_01]: the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these dabs are delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll split this in half with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure you got some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll give you a dab of what's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tasty though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get a dab at the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so first place, People's Cup
Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Golden Goat Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta love that Golden Goat Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: By Infusions, powered by the Green
Solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the Green Solutions with
their Golden Goat Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I frickin' love some Golden Goat Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Golden Goat's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good for migraines,
good for seizures, good for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for naps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to take a nap, do not smoke
some Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the strains that if you need
to get the dishes done and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated, puff a little Golden Goat,
and you might get wired up enough to go
[SPEAKER_01]: and do the dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got in that dabber,
homie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just looking?
[SPEAKER_01]: That lemon sativa blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's some tastiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at the Cup this week loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys better look out for us when the
Secret Cup comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should knock that dab off there,
or do it, and then I'll give you this
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, there's that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take that carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got three more words to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a mouse on the computer and I just
scrolled the mouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my secret for finding where I need
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna crush at the Secret Cup,
so there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we figured out what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about it after the show off the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: The People's Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta explain two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carb cap and flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran myself into a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flowers, for the people that aren't
from Colorado and aren't hip to all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: cool lingo, flowers are pre-run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just fucked you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Adam Mill calls it pre-run
because flowers are buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers in concentrates, flowers in hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers are just buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the flower of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just call it that here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the guys call it pre-run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels disrespectful to my plant that I
just spent three or four months trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: nurture and then you guys like pre-run,
but that's just my baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so People's Cup for flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour Diesel from the Walking Raven retail
marijuana center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who does not love some good sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I smoke sour D, it makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go fucking retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go full retard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go even worse than full retard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go like ADD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start nine projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn on the Xbox, don't even play it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make some food and don't even eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Star from New Age Medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Star is a good strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cut that was going around Denver,
it's got this really, in a good way,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells like burnt rubber and kush and
it tastes like dirty kush in your mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're into that good cushy,
dirty earthy smell, that Death Star that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes around, Colorado in the Denver area,
that's a good cut if you can find that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's Choice Cup for flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place was Presidential Kush from the
Green Solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple breeders that work with
cuts they call Presidential Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can't shout out any breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which one that came from,
but Presidential Kush Green Solution was a
[SPEAKER_01]: people's choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means people liked it, people voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go smoke some of that shit and see what
you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that was the High Times winners
list there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to find the one that Joey won so I
can read it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends from Natural Mystic Caregivers
took home an award and I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took home two awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best Medical Edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystic CBD Capsules from Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big up to Joey from Natural Mystic
Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_12]: He hooked me up with a few of those and
they were the last ones he had.
[SPEAKER_12]: He said he was going to hook me up with
some more, but they were the last ones he
[SPEAKER_12]: had so I could give to my pops for his
stuff that he's going through.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big thanks to that dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: He always has a real kind heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's always giving back to the industry
100%, so it's good to see him win some
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shelly from that shop actually is a cancer
survivor, so you can see the love that
[SPEAKER_01]: they put into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis saved her life and she gives that
back every day, I think, being involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: what she does so much.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love and respect to Natural Mystic
Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also won best medical non-solvent
hash for first place with the blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: waltz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-solvent hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my hash guy, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both dabbed out here a little bit,
but explain non-solvent hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Non-solvent hash is just, they don't use
any solvents.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing is dissolved on the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_12]: They essentially use cold temperatures and
ice to freeze.
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep plant matter frozen and knock the
trichomes off of the plant and to be able
[SPEAKER_12]: to separate, using filters, the trichome
heads from the trichome tails and then
[SPEAKER_12]: they make pure forms of ice wax.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ice wax and juice.
[SPEAKER_12]: After it's all extracted, they lay it out
thin and flat on parchment and dry it for
[SPEAKER_12]: several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no chemicals?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no chemicals used in it,
only water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other option is solvent hash,
which would usually be BHO or butane honey
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, which is made with, or CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BHO is made with butane and the CO2 is
made with compressed CO2, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's iso that's made with isopropyl
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is non-solvent, which means it's
made with essentially ice and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people, I'm going to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to say, but water is a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, water is not being used
as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of quoting Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving credit to this statement right
here, to Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not my teachings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickatee has taught me that water is not
being used as a solvent in water hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: ice hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is simply being used as a separator and
a carrier because what we're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're freezing the trichomes, basically,
and you knock them off of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how you get gum out of your hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember back in the day, you just freeze
the gum and it comes out of your hair,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichomes and the oils will fall off
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're not using it as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not dissolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just better to freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're extracting it from the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably said that all wrong,
but it's not a solvent in this case
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not being used to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're washing something, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught me better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't remember exactly what he
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should go Google it so that I could get
it right for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Nickatee is awesome at that
solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here on the screen it says,
second place, sour lemon OG, solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: from essential extracts and Trill
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right here, best US non-solvent
hash, white OG solventless wax from
[SPEAKER_01]: essential extracts and down with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to down with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a breeder and he is a cool little
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever he sees me, he's always got a
pack of seeds and a high five for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool little dude right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out for down with dirt seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be doing some big things
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I predict it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I predict that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 420 weekend happened, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody hear about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only was there the cannabis cup,
but there was also a big event at Civic
[SPEAKER_01]: Center Park in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few bands set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually an area where they were
selling alcohol, which we ranted about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first, on the last podcast,
we don't approve of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope nobody drank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin had a couple of friends that went to
the event at Civic Center Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did you say that they felt about
it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the people I've talked to,
everyone said pretty much it was really
[SPEAKER_12]: boring and they felt very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike past years with all the fencing and
security and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: They like, they commented that it made
them feel like they were in like a prison
[SPEAKER_12]: yard.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were extremely uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a tweet that said, with all of these
barricades and things, if somebody shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: this year, all we're going to do is
trample each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't judge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you guys are getting the wrong
idea of how we need to have our cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need to come look at the cannabis cup and
see how that was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there were 40,000 people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had to be 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 40,000 people there,
but this was a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's, everybody's friend did a
cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would have been patient enough,
we both would have gotten in with a
[SPEAKER_01]: wristband.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't want to hunt around and
find the right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's bringing in a homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every vendor got, so I'm sure there
were 50,000 people in that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to guess 40 to 50,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't see any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no need for major security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can agree that too much security
would be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to get stoned and chill
out, participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come dressed for war.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come dressed for a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: By late afternoon at the 420 rally in
Denver, Denver police had issued 47
[SPEAKER_01]: citations for public marijuana consumption
at the downtown rally, as well as 16 other
[SPEAKER_01]: arrests or citations for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver health medical center paramedics
had treated 14 people, including three who
[SPEAKER_01]: were taken to detox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were those people drunk or were they high?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people taken to detox.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is weed detox like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just sit in the corner and wish you
had some cartoons to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hospital's emergency room had treated
about half a dozen people, most of whom
[SPEAKER_01]: had passed out through a combination of
sun and substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say it's people that aren't used
to the elevation and haven't drank enough
[SPEAKER_12]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you don't drink water in that
elevation and you're dabbing and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice hot day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a wicked sunburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I feel like a kid again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been sunburned like this in
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so yeah, I would assume that a lot of
those people are, I pick on Texas a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say some people from Nebraska,
they weren't used to being up so high and
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to get dabbed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just ended up dropping like flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, what I'm reading comes from
the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to give them some credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to read about this girl
that got a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say her name.
[SPEAKER_01]: She lit up her chillum on the outskirts of
the rally just before police officers on
[SPEAKER_01]: bicycles rode by.
[SPEAKER_01]: They handed her $150 ticket for public
marijuana consumption, but they said go
[SPEAKER_01]: into a crowd where we can't pick you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were trying to be cool about it,
but she was just right on the outskirts
[SPEAKER_01]: where she was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, Hey, dumbass, we got to
give you a ticket, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that was not smart on her part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't seem like there were many events
because of cannabis this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet they were predicting a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's well, with all the police they had
set up, dude, like this is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are guard towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it was like a prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no way to celebrate 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year's rally had fences around Civic
Center, designated entry points with pat
[SPEAKER_01]: downs and bag checks, street closures,
dozens of vendor booths, from hemp energy
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks to festival favorites like the
turkey leg guy, and two stages for musical
[SPEAKER_01]: performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a shooting mard last year's rally,
armed security guards this year walked
[SPEAKER_01]: through the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: At mid-afternoon, the air even smelled
slightly less perfumed with pop than last
[SPEAKER_01]: year's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or then years passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were smoking less down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually easier to smoke outside
before it was legal, a person said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police are watching much more now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we kind of hosed ourselves by
doing this, you guys, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing we can do about it now,
but we got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we should take a quick dab and
then we should do the part of the show
[SPEAKER_01]: that we call Give Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we're going to find a
cool song, take a dab with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you in the mood to hear,
Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: Music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're such a smart ass, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if you guys have musical suggestions
for us, go ahead and send them because
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin doesn't have any ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some steel poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get some steel poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps if you spell it with an S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are torches that you hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a torch that you hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes some steel poles as long as
there's not a commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it's a commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit mute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can skip this ad in one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of steel poles while
I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, Kev, you're going in, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's dropping probably a quarter
gram onto the fucking dome list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, his eyes are crossing, but he just
keeps smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just clotted out the whole spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No wonder my computer won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to take a little dab
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cough into the microphone,
let people know we're still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit the flux now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check us out next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're going to do a review of the
Hive ceramic nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dome-less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a full review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't taken enough dabs off of it to
know what I think yet, so we'll hit it
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily next week on the show and I'll
tell you what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your favorite rig with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will bring my favorite rig with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that it works best with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how you would set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy some steel poles and Kevin on his
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to that lovely young lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Savor my last grapefruit dab on the show
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, tastiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mouth is liking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give thanks to somebody,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe the flavor of that
on your tongue?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Jolly Ranchers came in orange,
that's what it would be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you guys like Kevin's descriptions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm done coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every episode we try to do a part of the
show called give thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to apologize in advance because
the two of us may tear up a little bit for
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the most special episode or
version of give thanks we've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to give thanks to a young lady by
the name of Jenny Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking for the right words to
say about Jenny Kush and I honestly did
[SPEAKER_01]: not know Jenny a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see the effect that she had on my
community, our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that she deserves to be awarded
and honored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, Cannabis Cup, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I saw a magazine with Miss Jenny
Kernan on the cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the magazine is CM Report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's October 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's volume one, issue three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a free magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a beautiful painting of Jenny on
the cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got red, gold, and green hair,
purple in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the author of this and him and I kind
of were in the same boat about with our
[SPEAKER_01]: level of how much we knew Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to read another person's
article because it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure I'm recording this
because we've had issues with the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: While traveling home from a concert,
Jenny and her life partner Jeremy were
[SPEAKER_01]: struck head on by a drunk driver traveling
the wrong way on the high occupancy
[SPEAKER_01]: vehicle lane early in the morning of
August 31st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny hosted Sexpot Radio, where they
would discuss some of our favorite things,
[SPEAKER_01]: sex, pot, and all around mental,
physical, and spiritual well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny often attended local rallies and
protests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with her background in nursing,
Jenny was always ready to help someone in
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't my article, but I
completely, this is we're in the same boat
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says, I only had the pleasure of
interacting with Jenny on a few occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel somewhat underqualified to write
this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although my personal experience with Jenny
was limited, my experience with those her
[SPEAKER_01]: life touched is plentiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go slowly because if I go too
fast, I'll tear up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all high and you're making me read
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This woman brought a community together in
a way I have never before witnessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within hours of hearing the horrible news,
her friends quickly organized donation
[SPEAKER_01]: pages to collect money for Jenny's four
surviving children, Shelby, Christopher,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan, and Tyler.
[SPEAKER_01]: The memorial party was organized at the
Hood Lab on Larimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the first 48 hours, the fundraiser
site had collected $7,381.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was at that party and donated really
heavily.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was proud to be at both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll add that to the $5,700 collected
at the Hood Lab and another $3,000 from
[SPEAKER_01]: Moms of Marijuana donation page put the
total over $15,000 in less than two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our community that did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't say our community,
but that was mostly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that shows that we're not a bunch of
weed heads that we unite for a cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we love somebody, man,
we can show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the response from Jenny's
mother, Lori, on the donation site from
[SPEAKER_01]: Lori Monson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any of you, but Jenny was our
daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the names sound familiar as Jenny
was always talking about her friends from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to tell all of you how much it
means to me and the rest of my family what
[SPEAKER_01]: you are doing for our daughter's children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many blessings and thanks go out to each
and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part that makes me cry a little
bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was someone's daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our friend, but I'm going to try to
read on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hood Lab was packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hood Lab was packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passionate right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was insanely packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to keep it together for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hood Lab was packed and there was a
line of about 30 people formed around the
[SPEAKER_01]: front door of friends waiting to sign the
guest book and make donations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was most definitely the largest
crowd, 250 plus people in attendance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest crowd the venue had seen since
it opened in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason, a celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so well written right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tears are for pussies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Jenny Cooke quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason, a celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: A celebration of the life of Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were balloons and unicorns,
rainbows and tutus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, we saw big 300 pound dudes and tutus
and shit with rainbow socks, bows in their
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple hair, awkwardly long hugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our industry is known for awkwardly long
hugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a fucking fish concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laughing and of course there were tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm crying right now and I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss this girl and I don't even know
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was overwhelming to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched strangers hug, a woman dressed
as unicorn cry and we all enjoyed some
[SPEAKER_01]: laughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stories of Jenny's good deeds,
fantastic edibles, acts of peace and her
[SPEAKER_01]: unique laugh were told.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only fitting that following the
thunderstorm the next day, Jenny blessed
[SPEAKER_01]: us with an extremely vivid rainbow across
the entire Denver sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was everything Jenny loved and exactly
how she would have wanted it to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: minus the tears, is tears of the pussies.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't get the chance to meet her very
much.
[SPEAKER_12]: I met her, I knew so much about her for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being in the room with her,
being in the room with her at the secret
[SPEAKER_01]: cup, you could just feel she was,
she was everybody there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was their mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave everybody like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the first time and only time I
got to meet her.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a little conversation when I met
both Jeremy and her at the, I was a seven,
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 cup.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was when Jeremy was doing the
panel, the panel at the top shelf panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: After that, I introduced myself to Jeremy
and he introduced me to Jenny and they
[SPEAKER_12]: both knew about my hash company and were
following me on Instagram and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were, they were like my heroes and I
had only heard about them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had never met them before.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were just, they acted like I was
just, you know, their best friend in the
[SPEAKER_12]: whole world for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that's how they treated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how she seemed to treat
everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just acted like she had known me
forever and I was the best thing in the
[SPEAKER_12]: world.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was for, you know, a good five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was, I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody has ever treated me like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: The moment they met me, like never.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was, I'll never forget that dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, it made a pretty lasting
impression on what a human being can be
[SPEAKER_12]: and what we can do like as a person if we
want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second to say what's up to
somebody.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to give super big thanks to
Jenny Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also Jenny had four children and what
any community should do is help take care
[SPEAKER_01]: of some kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tweet a link to it so that you
don't have to search to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Twitter, go to I Grow Culture
podcast and there will be a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that link and I promise it's a
real website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you're actually donating money
for Jenny's children.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a beautiful picture of Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's worn a hemp necklace and a,
I don't know, I'm not a, I'm straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what to call this top
she's wearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got her arm up on her head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now there are $21,900 raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I can do, I grabbed a couple of
pins from the Rare Dakeness Jenny Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: booth at the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got three pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, it's a Sexpot radio pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is an iDab pin and the other one is
the Zombie Unicorn pin, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: rare and limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make those a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first person that contributes $100 to
Jenny's fund on Fundraiser and sends me
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of a picture or a screenshot on
Twitter at I Grow Culture, I'll send you
[SPEAKER_01]: these three pins as a thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the least I could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to this website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tweet it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You donate $100 and I will send you these
pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take like a snapshot or something and
message it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if you go throw down money on
this site, it looks like you can Facebook
[SPEAKER_01]: or something and it shows people who have
given money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows Mitch Geist gave $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby Black from High Times gave $200.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, this donation is on behalf of
myself and my wife, April, as well as a
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman named Eric Karl, who was the
winning bidder in the auction for my porn
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bobby got married a little while ago
and he auctioned off his porn collection
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of the proceeds went to Jenny
Kush.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows Joel Halen gave, dude,
big fucking love Joel Halen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say how much he gave.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three posts in a row that are my
rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Joel Halen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see it if you post here,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just want to take a screenshot
with your phone and tweet it to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you these three pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel like we can all work together that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get our shit together
and quit crying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love Jenny Kush, support the Rev,
support her children, support each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any one of us could get hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to wrap up that story,
the person that killed Jenny Kush has
[SPEAKER_01]: pleaded guilty to manslaughter,
vehicular manslaughter is what I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: charge is.
[SPEAKER_12]: There were no pleas offered.
[SPEAKER_12]: So she just stepped up and pled guilty to
what the hell she did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not many people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She faces 36 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: 36 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish her the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: She killed somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to live with that inside
forever and I hope she can learn and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hope she can recover.
[SPEAKER_12]: All I can really say is ride on for just
pleading guilty and not making them go
[SPEAKER_12]: through fucking another year of court and
just keep dragging it on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just get it done and over with and get
your shit started and get it done.
[SPEAKER_12]: A way to the prosecution for not budging
on doing deals and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't see that too, too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they may have caught on to
who the lady was that they killed and they
[SPEAKER_01]: killed a celebrity with the way cannabis
is going around here with the support from
[SPEAKER_01]: the community that we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: They killed a celebrity.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything she did all the way leading up
to legalization and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was a champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in a billion person right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to harp on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a community, what we need to do,
excuse me, I'm not requiring a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar donation, but that's what I'm going
to do to send you a pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys can throw down 10,
20 dollars, these are four little kids
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have a mama that needs some
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have family to help out,
but who expected mama to disappear?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I disappeared, I hope somebody would
throw down 10, 20 bucks to help my
[SPEAKER_01]: daughter out with some food.
[SPEAKER_12]: If everyone threw in 50 cents,
if every single person threw in 50 cents,
[SPEAKER_12]: it would be 500 million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just make those numbers up?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just figured about the average adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look fucking confident.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like three and a half billion
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a little somber after the Jenny
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny Kush, we love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue because this is
emotional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on our next episode, we're going to
answer Twitter questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got questions, send them to us
at agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed related stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know about growing,
if you want to know about laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to know what's up in Colorado,
if you got questions, feel free to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like interacting with the people that
are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please send me your Twitter questions
at I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a friend coming on the show
pretty soon who is not a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see about that when he's on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he has a lot of questions about
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that we talk over people's heads
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he has no idea what we're saying a
lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to ask us a bunch of
beginner questions and we're going to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of help our listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say his name yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say his name yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name or if he's got a moniker he will use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've sat at this table with
him, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen him naked in his comedy act.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just blew his whole bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I plan to start doing the Grow
School.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get comfortable with the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get comfortable with the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to figure out the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today it took a dump on us while we were
recording the first episode, or the first
[SPEAKER_01]: round of this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get that figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to do Grow School.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go from germinating seeds
all the way up to drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about a lot of stuff
in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything else to say Kev bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really man.
[SPEAKER_12]: That about sums up the cannabis cup
episode I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended it well with Jenny Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good shoutouts to everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got Jenny Kush thanked.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's good for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well check us out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check us out on Facebook at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check us out on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can listen to the show on iTunes,
Stitcher, and in less than a week the show
[SPEAKER_01]: will be available on a site called Swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's www.swell.am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They claim to be kind of like the Pandora
of the podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click like on a couple things
they'll try to find what you like and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you click fucking hate this they'll try to
not play that stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's their shtick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in email contacts with them over
the past couple days and they claim that
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll have my feed up in less than a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know that you like the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep listening, keep listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The song, the opening song, I don't know
if I ever said it, that was First Place by
[SPEAKER_01]: Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: The closer is going to be Blaze Up by
Midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go ahead and find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey thanks for sticking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to me cry while we
talked about Jenny Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to see my sensitive side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging out with me at the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may sound weird but it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to dinner with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does sound weird but that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never gone and just sat down at a
snazzy restaurant and just grubbed down
[SPEAKER_01]: and were bros at a restaurant like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two dudes stinking like weed in a classy
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fun with you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get to do that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to play some Midnight now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it fat dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's episode number eight of the I Grow
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me for Midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome fade out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come into Kevin with the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what's up Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have said what's up Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been a lot smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to that cool intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hanging out here with we got Jesse
and we got Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint's got a great look on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scared of these dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scared it's going to get in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got our buddy Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever smoked in your life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked and never done anything much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you know hitting the ball back ten
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So weed has changed completely since back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was East High School weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have no idea what weed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be in for some lessons today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint's going to get an education.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants us to teach you guys some of the
amateur stuff that we seem to have
[SPEAKER_01]: forgotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music's too loud in my headphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also sitting over there on the table we
got our buddy Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost said your last name dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jesse and our buddy Spence were in a
contest or a competition called the Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Bud Bowl over the 420 weekend and
they both got some awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of award did you win over there
Jesse?
[SPEAKER_14]: I took overall in private entry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Overall crowd favorite for my Grape OG.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a really good review.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the people that hosted the contest
said this was such a favorite of myself
[SPEAKER_01]: and the judges until there was none left
to display.
[SPEAKER_01]: A landslide winner in this category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said you drew that shit to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you make the Grape OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped Paul and Chuck.
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul and Chuck.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that phrase.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was provided the pollen and just hit it
with a plan I had and I wasn't expecting
[SPEAKER_14]: what came out from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really floral, really grapey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: No it's really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It smokes great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has pretty good benefits to it as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some positives behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you tell us what the cross is or do
you want to keep that a secret?
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mom is a reversed Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I've had SFV OG from Cali Connection I
believe.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other female.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'll just kind of keep that one
quiet for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that reversed female that uses
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint's lost over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's already lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he made a scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And used, I'm not even going to ask about
the method because I'm a breeder too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't talk about how we do our
reversing and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you take a female plant and you
reverse it, make it into a male by certain
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and then it'll spit out pollen
that only has female traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll make female seeds out of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the questions I had for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll elaborate on that a little more if
you want to.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Grape OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it taste like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you bring me any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that this right here in the jar?
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm popping open a jar here.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the little shaky bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were able to return to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm amazed at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dense as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bright green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice orange to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it's called grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approve, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicely grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't attend the Super Bud Bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was up at the cannabis gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time I'll have to grow something and
have one of you guys rep it for me or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize we could do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually saw, I can't remember the
gentleman's name, but I saw a really great
[SPEAKER_14]: Heart of Gold sample there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said he was also growing your Grateful
Dog too at the moment.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish we knew who that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it any good?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was one of the more Golden Goat Finos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart of Gold leans a lot to the Golden
Goat side.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was one of the real heavy ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: I smoked a joint with him.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to whoever did a good job with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up on Twitter or email me or
something because I'd like to see your
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll give you some more beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run some good stuff for me.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spence, what'd you win, buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: I entered in the private side of Hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end, they ended up joining the
medical and the private side together.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took second place in Best Wax is what
they called it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you enter Shatter or Wax?
[SPEAKER_08]: I entered Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Talisman?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been dabbing that all weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in Gage products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Gage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gage Green, good family.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet Keyplay and MK4 or M4K,
whichever one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry I totally interrupted.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took second behind my job conveniently
so it was not too bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Talisman OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if they're calling it an
OG, but Talisman.
[SPEAKER_08]: My mix was actually three different phenos
of the Talisman altogether.
[SPEAKER_08]: I figured it'd give a better taste for
what it was made of.
[SPEAKER_08]: I dubbed it Kimtrails because it was made
out of ... One of the parents of Talisman
[SPEAKER_08]: is Kimdog OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very, very Kimmy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we named it the Kimtrails.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody hit me up and said, I like Kim,
but I don't like Kimtrails.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, well, you'll like it anyway,
so it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rare Dankness has a stream called
Kimtrails, so be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder about that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bust your balls a little bit
and we're bros, so it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the hash makers make hash,
sometimes it's confusing to patients when
[SPEAKER_01]: you label it as Kimtrails because now they
think it's Kimtrails dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you made up a name, I see ... I know
one guy online on the damn internet that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes up names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we took off his headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to fight?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the headphones cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tap them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tap them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's all right, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people mix up the flavors,
it's confusing to the patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: so just to bust your balls a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool though.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for a competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't for a dispensary or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get your headphones going,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to hit a Kevin Neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it sound?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to tap on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone again.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you like that, but does it make the
headphones work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have seen the look he gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing over there, Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're quiet today, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dabbed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent one, two awards, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proud of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to rep, Pablo, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We promised the viewers, or the listeners,
the viewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even see us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We promised the listeners last time that
we're going to talk about your hive nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take some dabs off of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a little bit of a
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a hive nail, something I
should tell you, don't use titanium tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use metal tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use a paper clip coated in plastic
like one of our friends tried to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening, bro, you've done a
lot of smarter shit than that in your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not ... Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use weird tools on the hive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use some glass or some ... They need to
make a nice ceramic dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a dabber and carb cap,
but they were sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: No?
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not buy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to heat it in a circle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For how long?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a count?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a count in your head?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always know how long ... I have not
counted.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not took the time to count.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about 15 to 20 seconds, usually.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you haven't counted, how do you know
that?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do I know what?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you know that it's 15 to 20 seconds
if you haven't counted?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's about just estimating time.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guestimation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of ball busting on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guestimation time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guestimation time.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heat in a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that's good?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't touch it, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it needs a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to tell when a nail is hot
enough, but it needs a little more.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to kind of feel warm to your
fingers about an inch above.
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 to 25 is where I think we need to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want it to be hot, but you don't
want it to take a second to feel warm
[SPEAKER_12]: either.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you should feel the warmth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do one of you hash guys want to explain
about low temp dabs and all the people
[SPEAKER_01]: overheating their dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Either one of you guys, both of you
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent an order to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll chime in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: The low temp dabs really help conserve the
cannabinoids and the terpenes throughout
[SPEAKER_12]: the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you do higher temp dabs, you end up
boiling away and it destroys some of that
[SPEAKER_12]: molecular structure if it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But also you don't want to do them too
cold either because sometimes you want to
[SPEAKER_12]: melt all the hash, obviously.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to get everything consumed from
the dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: And God forbid, if there is residuals,
it does help.
[SPEAKER_12]: Burn off the residuals so you don't
consume those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pentane burns at 600 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want it to be too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 605 will burn off pentane and butane.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people don't understand it,
but you don't want to be dabbing off of a
[SPEAKER_08]: scolding red nail that's not very good for
your body.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously you can tell when you're
yakking up after a dab, it's most likely
[SPEAKER_08]: from your dabs are coming off a red hot
nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you take two big of dabs like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of do them too large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it wasn't my first hit off
there, but it was my first one on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I overheated it just a touch, but it
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I liked is somebody told me that you
could take several dabs off of it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of overheat it the first time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it holds temperature really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I even say this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the car and dabbing and all
three of you in the car need to get a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't want to be with the torch in
the car a lot, then you can pull two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that if I just promoted
dabbing in the car, but people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a guy in Denver a couple weeks ago
dabbing in the car and he scared the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought he was going to drive into some
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was not pro like us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I thought you were talking about a
parked car.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab in the car if you're parked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't dab in the car if you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you're a passenger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm driving, Kev should take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should take more dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should take one for me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One for your homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow it in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of that nail,
Jess?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: It scares me though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a couple of them that are...
Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to... I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fragile things scare me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's partly why I'm afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we break it, I approve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try my best not to break your nail,
bro, but it's ceramic and in my world,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're heating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes sense to me that it's going
to bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends has one at his house and
they broke it pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the nail is the piece that's
connected to the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinton Noob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask the questions that some
people aren't going to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you here for more episodes just to
chime in just like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly what we need you for.
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that would be referred to as a
rig.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that looks like a bong called
the rig, there is the heated part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a baby bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that you're heating up is called
a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I've gathered so far.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is either ceramic or titanium or quartz
or glass if they're really cheap shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Jeff dabbing off of titanium as
well as now I've seen the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, between those two, what do you guys
prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a preference in between those
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the ceramic still new and you don't
know yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't spent enough time with the
ceramic to see how long it'll last.
[SPEAKER_01]: The titanium does burn out from heating
and cooling and absorbing all that earl
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does kind of burn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had the ceramic long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't seen one around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ceramic doesn't come in a domed
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my backpack when I'm cruising,
I need a dome because I get shit stuck to
[SPEAKER_01]: my domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time I go to use it, it tastes
like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a domed one like with the dome
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need this style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a cap that goes over your
nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are domeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hole right down the center of it
so you don't need the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more convenient for here at
the table, but in my backpack,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need this style.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That dab I just did, I didn't even heat it
with the torch.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was still hot enough for me to do my
dab and it was the perfect temperature
[SPEAKER_12]: actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of a bro dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_14]: This actually also represents progression
in nails too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting with the domed ones and then the
domeless and now the ceramics.
[SPEAKER_14]: The domed ones were the first ones?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, what was kind of first was the
swing arm skillet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a piece that came out of here
and it hung upside down and they wrapped a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of wire around it and hung a little
titanium plate underneath there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drop your dab on the plate and when
you inhale, it'd go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things hit like a freaking truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a bell over a little hot plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very happy that we moved away from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to TASC for improving and
innovating the nails every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Grape OZ or OG, sorry, Grape Ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Grape OG, is that something that
somebody can pick up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a place they can pick that up or
is that just your personal stuff?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the Shatter we were talking about
earlier, I already forgot the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they sell that kind of stuff in
dispensaries and recreational places?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something they can pick up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I work for a shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: The demand for it is so high that it's
never around.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean it is, but once it's there,
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm kind of half ass trying to
plug your stuff so people can buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's your stuff, then fuck them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of dads are hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of us that are blessed enough to
have a nice little slab like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: we kind of hoard it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take my material from ... Well,
I'm a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a seed breeder and I have my own
little caregiver grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take my leftover material, the trim and
whatnot, and let these two guys blast it
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they make a lot of their cut
for their personal hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get into their business,
but then I get my cut back and I barely
[SPEAKER_01]: get enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dab a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got patients that I have to
distribute it to share it with medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It disappears very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the room nodded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting there going, oh, because I've
only hung out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody's dabbing, it's only been
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always see there's a good amount of,
I guess, shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we're going to call it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wax, whatever other names you guys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any wax?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you some wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it right, you take this
product and at the end, you heat it again
[SPEAKER_01]: and apply a whipping motion to it to put
air into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fluffs it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people skip a couple of steps and
they do that too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucks everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it right and do it at the end,
wax can be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like about it, this we have to use
the little dab tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of shattery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to work with wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick it up and play with it and
make a little ball and just slam dunk it
[SPEAKER_01]: without a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little easier to work with and it
hits harder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the best tasting hash I've ever
smoked has been wax.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some tangy wax will make your day.
That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy down there at the end of the table
actually has made the best tasting wax
[SPEAKER_14]: ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say it was the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's always been one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do a lot of the lemon stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd make wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that lemon Jeffrey is some of the
best dabs you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people always ask, what's your
best for dabs if you're making shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Order up a pack of lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sold out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a long time to breed some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see that you're sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think you can refill it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, it takes a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take to breed seeds and
what exactly is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes the hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quick part is you got to get plants
that you have to make selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a male and know which
females you want to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get them large enough to put
into the flower stage, which will take you
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three months, the way that I like
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually about two months, three if you're
just from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to get those flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: One needs a head start on the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not get specific into times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking about 12 weeks of flowering
time after the two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking like five or six months
just to produce the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you need to test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were going to put them out,
I would give them to all these guys to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow to see what they do before I would
even consider putting them out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if I find that they're kind of fucked
up, but they're close, I'll find one
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really close to what I'm looking
for because there'll be variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a whole nother.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be variations in phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brothers and sisters all don't look
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd find the brother and sister that looks
just perfect that I want to make babies
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd keep that one and breed it back with
the daddy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll bring the traits that I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sometimes that second cross is
sometimes when you fuck everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do it right, if you've got that
magic, it's all genetic combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they match up right, you'll come out
with, by the third or fourth generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: every seed will be very similar to each
other by the time they're done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making F1s from Thames and
you're cool with that, five months,
[SPEAKER_01]: six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making F1s that are regs,
five or six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to make F2s, which are
going back and re-breeding or make F3s,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years and years.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been back crossing for four or five
years now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm only on the third leg of the back
cross.
[SPEAKER_14]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to growing a weed than
many people give you guys credit for.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I look at it and I'm like,
all right, well, there's plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground or plants and pots and they're
growing them and then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look at all the back work that
goes into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the last time I smoked weed
was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, things are going to get better,
but I did see that huge progression when
[SPEAKER_00]: medicals started being okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really is what helped us be able to
breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could set up, not we, but they could
set up a thousand light warehouses and
[SPEAKER_01]: just throw out as many seeds as they could
and grow all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you find that magic keeper.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can grow in that many numbers,
that's why Holland is big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland lets you kind of get away with a
lot of plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Holland.
[SPEAKER_14]: The best comes from Northern California or
Cane.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cane.
[SPEAKER_14]: That comes from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado breeders are killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even just because we're from here,
but we have a lot of advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the same altitude and climate and
conditions as Afghanistan, which is where
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of our favorite genetics are from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: 300 days of sunlight a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get that in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides Iraq.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew up in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The plants get huge here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Gigantic yields.
[SPEAKER_14]: Trunks this big around.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the listener, that was like a 12 inch
circumference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easily one of those Gatorade bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two water bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not my arm.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen branches that grown men can
actually stand on.
[SPEAKER_14]: To reach the top of their plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen guys have to get ladders to trim
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know spots where I've been on 350 plant
outdoor farms where the four of us grown
[SPEAKER_01]: men sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Kevin, I didn't mean to exclude you
from the grown men, but it wouldn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: you also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs us four.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four of us could reach around these
plants and barely touch hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the four of us would take to get
around these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking five pounds on some of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on Jesse's, but these are in a
mountain town where nobody will find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five pounds out of one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five pounds out of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rocking probably 300 of them on
some of these plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting a lot of money into the
... You were saying all the back stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a crew out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a crew like us boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a crew of us working there all day
long from morning to night all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at night they just hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like camping all night.
[SPEAKER_14]: They pass out because it's hard manual
labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't give us credit for being ...
I've got an indoor facility and you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: trash to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city doesn't want your weed trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to handle that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get that to the dump and the
dump doesn't want it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a fireplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that's a fire ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want them coming to your grow
facility or burning and fucking all these
[SPEAKER_01]: poppies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got dirt to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got water to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricity, the fire hazards,
licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to ... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and that's something I think
everybody got mad because the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: were, oh, it's going to be so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get it from this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, yeah, but look how
professional they are being in these
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go through such regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed there mostly is usually pretty
clean, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some dirty shit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going through a lot of regulation
now, so the weed's tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going through Steep Hill
Halent Labs or a similar laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting all their stuff tested for
molds, parasites, pesticides, little bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's spider mites or fungus gnats or
white flies in your weed, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Addison said that they can test for things
like fluoromite and azomax and azomite in
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants and Eagle 20 in your buds if
you use that shit in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is a miticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is actually a fungicide,
and the other one is just an all-around
[SPEAKER_01]: bug treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is in the cloner is
basically the start of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut a plant, and it's got a clone to
make roots, and then you've got a vegit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people go three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go 30 to 45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them a little bigger, and then you
flower for usually nine weeks is average.
[SPEAKER_01]: From these little tiny babies all the way
to they grow, and you flower it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you dry it, you trim it out, this lab can
find pesticides in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be like, oh yeah, use this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dry it out of this kind of bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: These are like neurotoxins and proven
carcinogenics and all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't want to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are dabbers.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're meant for ornamental flowers that
aren't going to be consumed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but Monsanto doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsanto will spray that right on your
corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: As medical caregivers, his Pops is quite
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a condition that if we gave him
some cannabis that had neurotoxins in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's only going to make him worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to heal him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of stuff that we all have
to be aware of, and we have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what separates the medical growers
and the real growers from just the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: out there trying to make a buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather cut down a moldy plant,
throw it away, than sell it to one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: ...
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my patients honestly are older
cats, and I don't want to see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to feel like I just killed
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels good to watch people.
[SPEAKER_01]: His old man came over one time,
felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He walks with a cane, hunched over,
walks with a cane, smoked the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: strain with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude stood up and walked up the
stairs and turned around and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, will you bring me my cane?
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of shit that makes you
feel like Jesse's smiling over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence is nodding his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of shit that makes you
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some weed that people hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that, and I made this guy stand up,
and he forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he forgot that he hurt,
or if the pain went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interaction, the smoke session,
and the cannabis healed him long enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for him to forget his cane and walk up
some stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot where I was even going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so passionate about that topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: At the Bud Bowl this weekend, one of the
judges that had, man, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the right show for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the judges that smoked the Grape OG
was epileptic.
[SPEAKER_14]: She told me she didn't have any seizures
for three days while she was smoking that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: She had already smoked pot and had good
results from it, but had still had the
[SPEAKER_14]: occasional seizure.
[SPEAKER_14]: With the Grape OG, she, I guess,
three days with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that a THC content or a CBD
content?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hasn't been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the perfect combination, whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist, but as my experience
with the plant and administering plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and strains to people, I think it's a
combination of terpenoids and THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, all of the different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a combination perfectly
matching her condition and her body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the full profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be another person sitting right
next to her that has the same condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it may not help, but I may have a
plant in my arsenal that may be perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: for that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's thousands of strains now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence is on his way to being a pollen
chucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time Kev gets good at growing weed,
he'll be a pollen chucker because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: watching all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only takes a little once.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're reaching for quality,
you want a pollen chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way that the progression goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to explain to a customer one time.
[SPEAKER_12]: He actually was like, I don't see why
there's all these different strains.
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't be different.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to explain to him, actually they
are.
[SPEAKER_12]: We found over 200 different molecules that
are in different levels in every single
[SPEAKER_12]: plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should get Addison Demora on the phone
one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can teach us about genome mapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get Addison on the phone in an
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll call him and see what he knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he can put us in touch with the
right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Addison Demora, Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Something else I'd just like to mention on
the subject.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD only legislation that is happening in
states.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe just a strain named after a book.
[SPEAKER_14]: They only want to grow that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's bullshit because of what we were
just talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the full profile, not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some conditions do require a higher level
of certain things than other conditions.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to find the right one that has
the right levels of the right molecules
[SPEAKER_12]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that somebody discovered,
this was not my discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Mitch Shinasa that made
this realization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that are high in CBD and low in THC
qualifies hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal to grow hemp all the fuck over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow large fields of CBD plants,
if that's your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then make RSO out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's RSO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we're not supposed to call it
RSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was referring to Rick Simpson oil,
but we're not going to call it Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Simpson oil anymore because there's some
controversy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People claim that he stole the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of weird stuff being said in
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any part of the backlash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full cannabis plant extract,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of ignorant to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an extract guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take the whole plant and you take a
whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like tar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's edible or you can rub it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically all the cannabinoids and
all the good parts squished into a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take just a pea-sized bite of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been known to ... I can't say cure
cancer, but stop cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy Chong claims that that's what got
rid of his prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Real life snake oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the real shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you called it snake oil,
I was like, oh, so it's fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but it's miracle shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the medical establishments want to
recognize that it's actually curing and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's curing things,
then they have no jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are little girls not having
seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tommy Chong doesn't have prostate
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty soon, our buddy Kev's Pops is
not going to have his condition if we can
[SPEAKER_01]: find somebody that's willing to help us
out with some ... I don't know how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how much product it
takes, but we need somebody to help us out
[SPEAKER_01]: with some RSO.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado and you've got a
little bit to help us out with trade you
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or something, we're willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a guy in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love him.
Or teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got two really smart extract
artists.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two good growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can breed a perfect strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I have an idea of how to make it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't have the material to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hurt yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done and it looks fucking
scary, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks scarier than making BHO to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those ingredients too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even ... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's ... RSO.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little tiny bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to get rid of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from a whole big ... The
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it called full extract cannabis
oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other names for ... Phoenix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phoenix tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the ... So there's a movie
called Run from the Cure or Run for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Race for the Cure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Race.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Race for the Cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Race for the Cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ray Simpson story.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to know more about it,
check that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth a watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that YouTube?
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube will have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the DVD of it here somewhere if you
guys ... I'll hand it to one of you if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very basic question.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indico versus Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody want to laugh them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Laugh at them.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: He meant the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one he wants to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck your Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's blue versus Sativa?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Indica is more of a strain from
Iraq, Afghanistan, rocky mountainous
[SPEAKER_01]: regions that is more ... It'll make you
lazier.
[SPEAKER_01]: More couch-locky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the strains where you will find the
CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sativa is more of a tropical region
kind of stuff that'll grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Indicas grow short and bushy and
have bigger fatter leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They finish earlier because where they're
from the cold comes and they got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done sooner and they don't get as tall
because they're in rockier areas so the
[SPEAKER_14]: land... Less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots actually branch out further this
way instead of going down because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: in rocky regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't dig so they get bushy because
they got bigger feet so they can balance
[SPEAKER_01]: out wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativas on the other hand are from
tropical areas so they get real tall and
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of get airy so they don't get
moldy because there's humidity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got to get some ... This is the
grossest fucking description.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when it's hot and your balls
swing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativas kind of spread out a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same reason your balls swing a little
bit and they get a little ... Trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Sativas kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys are getting larvae buds in
your grow rooms, it's because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: overheating and that's the exact reason
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not growing a good Sativa and
your shit's airing out, it's because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trying to get some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sativas are more from a lot of Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of stuff is from Vietnam,
Asian countries and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you laughing, Spence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't have somebody from
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's up, ping pong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Fong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Fong made my torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that a couple times on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a really cool custom torch,
find Fong.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll do your nails too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a picture of it right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and I'll tag Jeff in it so he
can check it out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I can check it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was saying so your listeners can
check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica's will finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica's, I've seen some that finish in
55, 56 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to let most plants go at least 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're done then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Indica's will be done around nine
weeks at the longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Sativas that take 77 days,
which is 11 weeks, and flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll grow tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they pack on way more THC like
the Sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get you way, I prefer that buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the next part, the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica's are the ones when you smoke it
and you end up laying on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to calm down, if you need to
sleep, if you need to eat, Indica's the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to get the dishes done,
if you want to paint, if you want to play
[SPEAKER_01]: music and get creative, if you want to
ramble on a podcast, smoke some Sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's kind of the opposite there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for like a layman like me,
somebody that doesn't do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do feel like this could be
advantageous to writing and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would I start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, you would have to- Three or four dab
hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd give you a little bit of- Let's
just do that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like a half a gram dab is the way to
go for the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't want to drop bombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mic needs a windscreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel myself blowing shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a new mic, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would want a pipe like this,
and I'm not encouraging, I'm just showing
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pipe like this with a fresh bowl of
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, if anybody at this table grew it,
it's going to fuck you up one hit and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just take one good hit, be hanging out
with somebody like us that knows what's
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't call your mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, Mom, I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll feed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to watch some
cartoons.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing from cannabis that some
spaghetti or a peanut butter and jelly
[SPEAKER_01]: sandwich can't cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need to do is eat and take a nap,
and if you're too high or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our good friend, Wade Ridley,
that is a good comedian buddy of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll come up with the- And Carlin said
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll write a bit and then he'll write it
sober and then smoke a little and go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and season it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like putting the dressing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go back and that's when you kind of go
and sprinkle some detail and get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: funk into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how I did it as a
musician too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd go to like writing sessions,
totally sober, but then you show up for
[SPEAKER_01]: practice or recording and you smoke a
little puff and that's when you start,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get a little funkier when you get
stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just loosen up a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the right strain,
some strains don't do this, but the right
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, like when you put blinders on a
horse, when the horse is at the fair,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it can't see the shit on the outside,
the left and right, it just focuses on
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good weed, the right strain does that to
me and it puts me just boom in the focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm playing music or growing weed,
watching a movie, playing a video game,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just that, it's like goggles for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one of those Indica Cheeba chews
and send me down to Trim and time flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I trim the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a nonsmoker where they're going to
get started is probably just try to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a joint or a pipe and just one or
two good puffs is all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody here grew one puff,
if you got it from the dispenser,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take two and just put it down and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't feel high enough,
you'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people like the edible
people that have just been scarfing the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole snack thinking that they're Superman
and getting hurt and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and that's something that I had kind
of thought like I was like, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: the edibles are probably like where you
want to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's way wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edibles will sneak up on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence is nodding.
[SPEAKER_01]: One night Spence's lady, they made some
dabs in a Pyrex dish like you're supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had plenty, so they didn't want to
scrape it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some residuals in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She put the dish in the oven to heat it up
and all the dabs soaked to the bottom or
[SPEAKER_01]: sunk like in a puddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: She poured a brownie mix on top of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there were four or six grown
men in that room that ate that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us were comatose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wrecked us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't get that high from smoking
like it would take all day to smoke that
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's pro level status.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Super Mario versus the dragon in
the fucking tunnel trying to fight Metroid
[SPEAKER_01]: on level three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was it was insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's seeing that's just kind of
something where I don't know where the
[SPEAKER_00]: where my thoughts came from on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess I just thought, you know,
you would you would just start with
[SPEAKER_00]: brownies or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have a piece of a brownie and that's
where you'll start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll last four or five times longer if
you eat a brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownie, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edibles last a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get I feel drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had nights where I've eaten too many
edibles, where I've woken up and been
[SPEAKER_01]: like, holy shit, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and you feel weed hangover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't complain from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a hangover in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too hyper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to smoke the indicus to kind of
keep me mellow when I'm smoking flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I smoke dabs, I prefer a sativa
for that headspin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You agree?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like edibles to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will put you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I use it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to eat edibles before a comedy
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see some comedy this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely stop at a dispensary and
pick up too many edibles and overdose
[SPEAKER_01]: myself for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'll be nice and high.
[SPEAKER_14]: T.K.O.
[SPEAKER_14]: Bart.
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: T.K.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then some cloddy bears.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, cloddy bears.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the perfect combo for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those guys coming from out of
state that haven't had the the experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do here in Colorado and they go to
a place, they go to just go buy something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with weed in a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with weed in a pipe, need a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy a pre-roll from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never buy a pre-roll from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving you all the shit that fell
on the floor while they're trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a bad time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a bad time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there you go, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you, Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make peace with you by
offering good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please be careful with edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start off with like a pipe or a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're going to eat an edible,
get something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a hundred milligram edible,
seriously eat a quarter of it and wait 45
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty five milligrams doesn't sound like
much of THC, but for a skinny dude like
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's size that's never eaten edibles,
that's plenty.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of people that come into the
shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too much for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like they need like an eighth of it or a
tenth of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ten milligrams.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: They seriously need like 10, 15 milligrams
and they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of like never tried weed in their
entire life.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're scared of that thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a pipe smoking.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they don't smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people at the cannabis cup this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in line for two hours,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about an hour into it, Kevin and I
pulled out our dab rigs out of our
[SPEAKER_01]: backpacks and just started dabbing like
champs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, something's cutting out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started dabbing and some people,
Chicago people were like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a guy his first dab at a party and
his eyes were redder than your shirt,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer's wearing a red Nike shirt and it
is blood red.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his eyes were that red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your ears are too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine are getting, I can feel them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, those dabs are no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some good dabs at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this fat dab sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take it out of this little
roster rig off of a highly edged kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 millimeter flux nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what I flux with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a strain for a non-user that you
would recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is said non-user a medical patient or just
a recreational smoker?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be Rick or a,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think your listeners are going
to want to hear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they want to hear both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a medical patient, I'm going to
see, I would elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going for, I always ask above
the head or below the head or like spine
[SPEAKER_01]: or brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's all, there's a couple of
questions there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toribora is an all around good strain for
new smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's low in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get a nice tingly body buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new smoker, your body will
feel good and high, but you won't freak
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't get paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so high in THC and THCV and THCA
that your head is going to spin and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what ruins the high for a lot
of people their first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so high, they're scared and
paranoid and freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you won't get that from the Toribora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also for a medical smoker, Toribora,
a rec and medical, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get head wrecked,
go for a strong sativa, get some sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's really sativa,
but when I smoke it, I can't pay any
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm a pro and sour diesel messes me
up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't sit down on diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one that makes you want to do the
dishes and all kinds of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just brought up something really
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give a plug to another
podcast just cause they clear up a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: myths.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Adam Dunn show for sure had Ken dog
and AJ and a Peabod.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think his name was on the show and they
talked about a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a fan of my show, you like the
Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions about a sour diesel
dabber, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got questions about sour diesel,
if you got questions about the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that made that shit and
established, well, they didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that made it famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they do a show and you want to hear
it like it's, it's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give a plug for another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody here at the table,
it's a weed smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin and I listened to it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Dunn, Mitch and NASA, all those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good show guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever hear my show, I'm not the only
one listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, somebody talk while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the, the Pueblo cup that you guys
just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how, how prestigious is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many entries and stuff like that are
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many categories?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was their first event.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody's first event is kind of,
you know, it's the first one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So nobody knows exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I mean, there was entries from,
you know, Penrose, local Pueblo dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, a couple other local growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so it was, I mean, it wasn't a large
event, but I mean, it was the first one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So next time can always be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to do it annually or is it
going to be?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll be annually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and is there a reason they did it in
April?
[SPEAKER_00]: 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking like, yeah, I understand that
one I got.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like our super bowl.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually with the cannabis scope,
it's rapidly becoming that literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking, um, uh, that maybe there
was something to do with the growth cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like a good harvesting time
that that would have been, that's why,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't know when, if you are doing
it outdoors, you're not going to have like
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor conditions like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control your, your outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when is the harvest when you're
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around Halloween.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, depending on your cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends on strain conditions.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, right before the first
snowfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sit outside and you wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you see snow, you go cut that
shit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Colorado, you got to let them go
right until then sometimes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, or you pull out the hoop houses in the
heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get elaborate here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, basically right around Halloween
is usually about harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so why isn't, uh, and then how long,
um, after say you harvest and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes you a couple of weeks to trim
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of the harvest to
get it trimmed and dried and cured up two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then after you're done
trimming, uh, how long until that weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be smoked?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on your, uh, thirst for the
money right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can cure it for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or your trim style too, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then in good conditions,
how long can that weed stay good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen weed last a year, but six months
is before it'll start degrading and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: in a jar sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the end of May would be the end
of, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the end of May would be like the,
try to get rid of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess April 20th would be like a good
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people flush out all their,
that's why you see the dispensaries with
[SPEAKER_01]: all their, uh, sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting rid of last year's outdoor
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think with the holiday that it's
becoming a lot of growers shoot for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's like, there's cups,
there's contests, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are actually a harvest ball,
uh, cannabis competitions, but we're so
[SPEAKER_01]: busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you've got a big outdoor grill,
you're just too busy at that season to
[SPEAKER_01]: even do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a big harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to trim it, cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to flip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay your trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get back cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get shit going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a busy time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's all good information
that, you know, if, if somebody was
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to attend one of those,
there's a good reason that it's in April,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that you're not super busy at that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when are you starting like to,
when do you start planting stuff when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're outside?
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and April still a little early here in
Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, June, June 1st is a good day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, so somewhere, um, towards the end
of July, beginning of September,
[SPEAKER_14]: did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_14]: August.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's when most strains will start
flowering outdoors.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen plants, you know, go a little
faster than what they did indoors.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but you know, that's where you,
when you go from the, it stops growing and
[SPEAKER_14]: starts, well, not necessarily stops
growing, but, um, that's when it starts
[SPEAKER_14]: producing a flower, a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the, that's the cone.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_14]: Little white pistils.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part takes about nine weeks to
develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last stab fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a good time talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I didn't even ask you how your 420 was
other than, other than your victory.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, I went to Canada's Cup on
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, worked, sold t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_14]: For the greener side?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stopped by the booth and it was
chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was chaos.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, checked it out a little, so,
um, then, uh, hit up the bud bowl on a
[SPEAKER_14]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean anybody cool at the Cup?
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Danny Danko, um, Giddy Up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I think that's it probably.
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw some cats, but, you know,
working and shit, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure you were busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I stopped by that booth and it was
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was right there on the other side at the
gauge booth a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about you, Spence?
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your 420?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the Cup was crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, there was a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the people person.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I like, I like people,
but there's just.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like thousands of people around you,
so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thousands.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the smoke too, so you can't really
just smoke walking around with 10,000
[SPEAKER_08]: people around you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it was fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to, um, see a bunch of people that I
wanted to meet, um, also pick up genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of people's goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick up a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, uh, when you say pick up a genetics,
what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get caught on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in my beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of comb in the beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the breeders go and they have booths,
all the seed makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could buy seeds of almost all the
hottest strains, most of the hottest
[SPEAKER_01]: strains on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pick those up at the Cup for
discount prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know the guys and they make
buddies, they'll throw you freebies and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy them straight from them,
it's a lot cheaper and you get some
[SPEAKER_01]: hookups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are those, uh, like feminized when
they come?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fem and reg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what, what would, um, what constitutes
it being feminized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it will, uh, 99.9% of those plants
will be females from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Not always though.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if done right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you get G bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's some strains that have failed
and it's just breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some genes don't match up properly,
so they don't make good seeds and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to throw those away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those come from a specific plant that
are going to produce female plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: female seeds, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so when I take a female plant and I
treat it a specific way and that makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: turn into a male, but it doesn't actually
have any male genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of stressed it to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it produces that pollen,
there's no male chromosomes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it hits the female, it's only
female genetics they're combining.
[SPEAKER_14]: Once women figure it out, we're all
fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you weren't listening to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I explained it to my girlfriend once and
that was kind of my reply, her reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should just end the show with a suction
sound and then we're all done right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once women figured out we're fucked,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never hear from us again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hate tweets we're going to get from
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, no, I don't think we'll get hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of listeners love us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you, did you go to some concert?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some pictures, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, I went to a dizzy concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a somewhat of a new hip hop artist
out of Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, he's got a good movement.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's all about like,
he makes a song called world peace,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and he smokes a lot of herbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was fortunate enough to be able to
give him some weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, cause who knows where he's getting his
weed from.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I figured, Hey, I'll give you some
weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw his Instagram cause he was giving
you shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He liked your weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a picture of him holding the
garden of weed and jar and he looks faded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's actually next to you standing
next to you in that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looks high as shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you go into like, and honestly it
wasn't like a big venue is that,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, Cervantes and then, so it was the
backstage is like an old locker room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who saw that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just blazed down, got to give them some
stickers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows where those, maybe those
stickers will make it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I saw where some of them made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some ratchet booty, some ratchet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would we, uh, what's your,
what's your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want people knowing that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a garden of weeding garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow some really, really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works with some of my strains,
uh, some of the irie genetic seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of my testers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with Jesse's as well too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do a bunch of growing for hit,
not for him, but I'll grow some same
[SPEAKER_08]: strains that he grows just to kind of have
him around since we're on plugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we find you?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Jesse grows all one board Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some lovely cannabis picks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I got my ghost Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fire strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of good stuff from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my white widow cut from Spence over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you Clint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at tall Clint, Twitter, Instagram,
then, uh, wild cousins on Facebook at tall
[SPEAKER_01]: client.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I didn't even say it to the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome on our other show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, uh, he's, he's got some Tourette's and
every once in a while the conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: will be going and you'll just your at tall
Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything you want to check out
online?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't look at me online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not interesting at all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm no longer interesting guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to stretch out one more question?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got like about 10 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I know that like hemp is important for,
for, uh, just becoming a better society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, like there's so much we can do
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know that we can only grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we grow it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like, is that legal now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we grow it like in a field?
[SPEAKER_14]: Untested.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well in a field.
Never.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, that's another question.
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you meant in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, one, I think so because,
uh, until now, uh, uh, Dr. Bronner's had
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy all of their hemp in Canada and
have it shipped here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure that the first hemp
crop that was produced in America was
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was purchased by Dr. Bronner's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some legal way that we can grow
hemp crops here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ignorant to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my computer is over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I unfortunately don't know all the
specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you guys are growing for different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's a good question that we
should understand because that's part of
[SPEAKER_01]: our industry and hemp is really reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we should be.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the government did just do something
to make it, there was a hemp pill.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to sound really ignorant,
but I'll give you this much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, there was a hemp bill that got
approved.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and then in Colorado, I believe they
just issued the first licenses this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the actual license last year's crop
was just kind of gray zone, testing the
[SPEAKER_14]: boundaries, getting the guy's feet wet.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: In a nutshell, that's so like the first
industrial license, like industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_12]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw pictures.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was down in Springfield.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, I wrote hemp crop on the,
uh, on the notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be something that I'll try to talk
about on one of the next upcoming shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Adam Dunn would be a great,
great guy to answer those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see him up at hood lab pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the hood lab, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys threw an awesome party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't ask you about your four 20 bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that in the last show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to the last show,
then you know all about my four 20 is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, shout out to Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_01]: He threw a hell of a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all hit the hive nail, the ceramic,
uh, anybody gotten in reviews or opinions
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to throw down it out of this
towards the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stuttering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: The flavors a little bit better than
titanium, I would say, I guess,
[SPEAKER_08]: depending on what you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, only reason I don't like it is cause I
broke mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't like, it wasn't as expensive as
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's titanium.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, it's if you break it,
you can probably buy another one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I don't know if, were there
directions in yours?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I didn't read directions.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably why I broke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a, I guess I am a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need to get a new one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been using it pretty much nonstop
since I got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Props for the nice little rig too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That thing hits like a toss.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sneaky.
[SPEAKER_12]: The dudes that I got it from hooked me up
pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So got a little pendant rig from him too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even remember their fucking name.
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked them like four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their sign was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something street.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from New Jersey, maybe Jersey,
Jersey boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Jersey boys grew some great,
grew some great glass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris Christie, if you're listening,
which I'm sure you are, uh, suck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with everybody at the NSA,
all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: One big bukkake session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hive nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you, did you have any opinions on it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm a, like I said, I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It scares me.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a mic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was smooth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's, uh, it's hard to tell how hot it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was my biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you say, I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of afraid to break it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, uh, highly educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, uh, I didn't pay him to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't even know that the show is
sponsored by highly educated titanium
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this show is brought to you by highly
educated titanium products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hook me up, task.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's, that's everybody's
phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hook me up, task.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's probably just mute to it by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like when you're a girl or give
me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: You say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: What clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, those don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's my turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the hive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it taste good?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to tell if it's hot enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid I'm going to break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I can't use my pre-existing carb cap
and dabber that I'm in love with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got to buy all new shit for that,
which I mean, for me, that's not a big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people are not, uh, privileged
and doing well and they can only buy a few
[SPEAKER_01]: dab things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess here's my, my sum up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can only buy one, they'll get
titanium cause you're going to break the
[SPEAKER_01]: hive eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're spoiled and you want to try
something cool, if you're a spoiled hash
[SPEAKER_01]: brat, if you're a connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're from Colorado, I personally
don't recommend it for like your travel
[SPEAKER_12]: rigs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like don't have it towards bouncing around
and shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like at home, you're heavy pieces.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: You just chilling on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on your coil and then leave it at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know what I mean by coil,
then if you got a coil condenser,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on your coil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no way to hook it up to so far
that I know of, I could be totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a way to hook it up to an
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get that going, I think that
constant heat would probably bust it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that would be, it should be using a
honey hole anyway, if you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Joel Halen.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do like, I definitely do like highly
educated titanium for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't find anything wrong with it at
all.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's where I'm headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can only afford one nail,
highly educated, either the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever size you got, go for the duality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably my favorite nail of all of
theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The duality, uh, the flux, the turbine
flux, uh, that's the, uh, so the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the flux is the one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the holes in the side and then
the turbine flux has like a cone shape on
[SPEAKER_01]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your earl kind of swirls around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the turbine flux is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my second, if you have a dome,
the turbine flux, if you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: domeless, go for the duality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, and then a carb cap,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use my carb cap on my dome rig too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fat plug right there,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one more question, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was a quick question and it
ended up more of us rambling about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like what laws are coming out right
now that we need to be aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know that like on, on the,
on the microculture Twitter, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had posted a few things like,
or look at, look at these guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are two of them that we should
pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, SB 77 and 78 is, uh, the drug
endangered child act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're going to make it to our what's
humming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a weird sound.
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like a drag car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was loud, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you guys got some gas over there or
no, some Taco Bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, SB 77 and 78, the drug endangered
child act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it basically is accidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accidentally aimed at, uh,
cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have marijuana and utensils in your
home and you have children, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: endangering your child.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe not accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that was another part of my
rant on that too is well, we're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: kids cannabis now cause it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we need to fight
against.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that accidentally, like if I had
this in another room and my daughter was
[SPEAKER_01]: on the couch, that's a drug endangered
child in their eyes with the new act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to fight that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the Instagram for agriculture or on
the Twitter, there's plenty of info of
[SPEAKER_01]: people to email and talk shit to about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the other one, I can't remember the
numbers of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a caregiver act that's trying to
limit, uh, Colorado caregivers to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: plants maximum, no matter what your
location or status.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a lot of reasons for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over it on a whole episode,
but if you're, uh, if you have a perpetual
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and you've got five patients that
require the amount of dabs that my
[SPEAKER_01]: patients require, uh, 30 plants won't cut
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people grow small hydroponic
plants and there's a reason why their
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors recommended them a certain amount
of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's going to be a new law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we're playing football.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're playing football, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You caught this pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got super close to the end zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got tackled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then suddenly the ref comes out and
goes, Oh wait, new rule, new rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't wear purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wearing purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back the fuck up 20 yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, wait, wait, I didn't know
about that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just made, and that's what they're
doing to us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Caregivers have been around for 14 years,
you know, as long as amendment 20 has
[SPEAKER_14]: been.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no issues up until now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all about the patients and the
caregivers without that relationship,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole model would fall apart and
they're trying to make more people have to
[SPEAKER_01]: shop at dispensaries and the dispensaries
are already out of medical weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have plenty of recreational weed,
which I think is a whole nother rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, it's about money in the long
run is what I think taking the money away
[SPEAKER_01]: from, uh, and it's not, they don't realize
we don't make any money being a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no money in it because we don't
take a lot of money from our patients
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're sick people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're most of them don't work like the
people I work with don't have a real job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't take money from them and
growing weed costs time, money and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lose money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, being a grower, like a
caregiver, they're on fixed budgets.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to, they think that
they're going to funnel money into their
[SPEAKER_01]: system from it, which they kind of will,
but in the long run, my patients are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go in pain or sick or what if,
uh, what if you're working with cash hide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cash hide had a tumor the size of golf
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that was keeping them
alive was some cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they limit his growers production,
his tumor is going to grow back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's passed already now,
unfortunately, bless him, but he's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he died because they took away his
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what they're going to
do to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are moving here because of the
availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're like, Oh, new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't find it fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we need to shoot down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm happy to be the ignorant guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have you back because you do ask a
great questions because if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: listening, uh, tweet us at, uh,
at agro culture and send us your
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, uh, I'd like to educate and
help you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have some of those, I heard this
and you don't know if it's true,
[SPEAKER_01]: send it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send it to me privately,
even if you want, and I won't say your
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you can not be embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like that, I invite all of
your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Facebook, there's an Instagram,
there's a Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been posting up some cool pictures on
my, uh, I read genetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't plug that very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually we do a portion of the show
right towards the end called give thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: where we give thanks to a person who has
heavily contributed to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week we cried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless you, Jenny Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still love you this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a really easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't take a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I saw it all weekend long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, everybody in the cannabis,
four 20, seven 10, the ganja movement,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from Clint with questions to the
growers, to the breeders, to the smokers,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the dabbers, to Danny Danko,
to freaking the guys learning to write to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody you've heard of gauge green,
TGA sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Callie connection, John hunt, steep hill,
everybody that you've ever not heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's what makes it a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what makes it a movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of you guys, without all of us doing
our little parts, there wouldn't be this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, without the Colorado people doing what
we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't sit here and dab out at a
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had a guest on that told me dabs in
Texas were a felony and you could do life
[SPEAKER_01]: in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at my table, look at my table and
think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all going to prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have the coolest prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's got a lot of boyfriends suddenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all of our girlfriend, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find them all off anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that was a long rant, but it was
heartfelt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, really without all the giant,
the, without all the little pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: the giant machine wouldn't function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I saw a lot of unity at the cannabis
cup this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of proud because this industry
has gotten clicky and I didn't see any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that bullshit at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that, uh, people that hate each
other, saw each other and gave each other
[SPEAKER_01]: hugs and made amends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, all of you guys,
everybody, if you're listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're not listening, if you've ever
smoked weed, if you've thought about weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you fought for weed, uh, if you flicked
a roach somewhere, if you found a roach
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere, you got anything to do with
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we give you thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being part of our family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, anybody got anything to say at the end
of the show?
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I think we should try that grape OG
real quick and give a little, a little
[SPEAKER_12]: review on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hand the bowl to the guy that brought
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want to tell us the genetics of
it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's keeping one parent's secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cool if I plug a couple of shows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, dude, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a May 2nd, we'll be at Phil's
radiator here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be, uh, that's a local
standouts, uh, for the first, first Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: after party, um, be up in Manitou,
uh, May 17th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you Manitou hippies go see some
comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're bringing some big names
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, on May 27th, we got a couple of
people, uh, coming from LA, David Ross and
[SPEAKER_00]: Amber Tozer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got, uh, one of my favorite
comedians, Sam talent coming down from
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amber Tozer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much better looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately I've seen a lot more of
your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but each of these shows is only $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be helping us out a lot just to come
and laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we got open mics and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, find us on wild cousins on
Facebook, wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's we we're trying to, we're trying to
make Pueblo better and, uh, Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, like just give us something to
do because, uh, I don't smoke and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: drink, you know, I quit smoking
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an e-cig now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like any puffs on that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a pacifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He nurses that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us who's all in the wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're on that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, uh, myself, uh, Paul Rosales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck him.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever you were going to say,
fuck him.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Bueno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck him too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little tiny hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previn Marquez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love that guy so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even joke about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, Matt Chapman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's awesome too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, we got some Denver guys that
are, I love all you wild cousins boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Andy Blano and, uh, Patrick Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's we're just having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody's getting so much
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only been doing it, you know,
eight months or so, like most of us down
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but I think we're getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very, uh, surprising, uh,
outcome towards the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could share it with the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they would get a taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, have some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taste the grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I had some great bubble gum in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to pass it to Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well done, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see why you can win some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on your winnings guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to end the show with some
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what we're going to play yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll piece in it at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace it in at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Language is hard after a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excuse us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any last words?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody, uh, likes or dislikes this,
uh, let Jeff know, cause we'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'll, we'll try to format to
what people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take a dab and laugh about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't like me being on here and
asking stupid questions, then let him know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do, if you think it's had value,
let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like his, his element.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forget we're pots and knobs and
elitists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forget that, uh, people aren't all up
to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great having you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I'm not just rubbing your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not this time.

[SPEAKER_01]: Also coming up in this episode,
we're going to talk about a local hookah
[SPEAKER_01]: bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got scrutinized for their private dad
parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to mention something about a
weed symphony and we're going to read a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about a review of a Denver Post
article that has a bunch of frequently
[SPEAKER_01]: asked questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They respond with some weird and sometimes
accurate answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to read a little bit about
that if we have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn this music down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce our buddy hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Kevin back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_12]: How you been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Been good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hanging out, hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's been real busy since 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thought it was going to calm
down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not in this industry, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It never comes down.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just keeps building and building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we drummed up more business and it
has made us even busier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good industry to be busy in,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a lot of cool things coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some collaborations and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to drop this music down a little
more.
[SPEAKER_12]: I did get my email sent to The Secret Cup
for my company name and all my contact
[SPEAKER_12]: info.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't received anything back yet,
but it has been sent and Big D sent me a
[SPEAKER_12]: private message on what to send and where.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I better get a crop going because it's
going to come soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to do it at the end of July,
I think, because the competition is the
[SPEAKER_12]: first week of August, I believe.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it has to be dried and ready to go by
then.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind me that after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, it is time to think about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_12]: You told me right after 420 if we hadn't
talked about it to let you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just put in my notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow or get some shit together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're well on the right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not planned at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the whole Secret Cup
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Jeremy that helps put it together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy Norrie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the rig rags dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an excellent event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he was also on another podcast I
listened to recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He seems to be knowledgeable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Big D, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the leaders in the hash industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn this music down just
a little bit more just because it feels
[SPEAKER_01]: too loud to talk over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't go down much more without muting
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how are you, bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Busy, just like you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been working the hell out of the shop
and getting stopped and asked all kinds of
[SPEAKER_12]: questions all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been... Are you calming down or
are you picking up?
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been picking up and we've been
doing... Summer is bringing in busier
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting more locals or are you
getting more out of towners?
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems to still be about the same ratio.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of our customers are out of towners.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of the guys are out of towners.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, most of the local people that come
in and buy weed, they already have their
[SPEAKER_12]: cards and shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's most of our medical side is our
local people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the rec gets a lot of out of
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shared some jilly bean with me from the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was tasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to get you some like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to pick some up for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how things go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before it's gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before it's gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some slabs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan from Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hang out with Jordan and also
with the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to hang out with Jordan the
other day and he threw me down some OG
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a couple of dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't last long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, those dabs were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpex at Turpex 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got other dudes, but Jordan's the guy
I met.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpex, good guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Turpex is one of my favorite companies for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for letting me kick it on
your couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't even elaborate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took dabs with your dad, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed up and Hunt was dressed in
business attire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him he looked like a substitute
teacher because I had my dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_01]: swinging around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in happy hippie in the sunshine mode
and he looked like he was Babylon there to
[SPEAKER_01]: give me a drug test or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He changed clothes and we got down to some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got a bunch of news I kind of
wanted to bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin and I used to, I don't want to say
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to hang out, kind of contribute a
little bit, sponsor, I guess, a dab party
[SPEAKER_01]: at a local hookah bar at the Cloud 9
hookah bar on 4th and Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the address is actually 420 South
Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_01]: 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was close.
Close.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the point is, and I'm going to
read a Facebook post that they post and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll just get right to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For additional information, there's a
phone number and then they say we shall
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to support this or something,
it's Cloud 9 hookah, H-O-O-K-A-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the one in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where Kevin and I rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're from Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something, if you want to help
out, if you have some legal advice or some
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance, or if you just want to chime in
on their page and show some support,
[SPEAKER_01]: go to Cloud 9 hookah and let them know
that you support them because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crap.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely had a lot of customers that
came into our shop because we were helping
[SPEAKER_12]: promote the last event that unfortunately
got canceled.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we had a lot of people come in that
night for the event and we're really
[SPEAKER_12]: bummed that they couldn't go and partake
because most of the people were from out
[SPEAKER_12]: of state that recently have moved to the
area.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they're trying to meet new people
and meet like-minded people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was people of all different types
and ages and everything, just like every
[SPEAKER_12]: other cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had everybody, it was packed on
that Saturday with people just coming in
[SPEAKER_12]: to get their herb before going down there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they were just bummed.
[SPEAKER_12]: They came to hear that all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're backing it 100% as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got a lot of customers that are trying
to help out with the movement too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if any of you guys are listening to it,
that's the Facebook page that you can go
[SPEAKER_12]: and show some support and you can write
city council, send them a well-written,
[SPEAKER_12]: thought out response and letter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't just write chicken scratch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Type it, use a printer, use spell check.
[SPEAKER_12]: Spell check, grammar check, all that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And show support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met several of our friends there,
people that we hang out with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have actually met a couple of people
that I knew already on Facebook that I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them, come down to this place and
meet me because it's a chill spot and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to bring new people to my
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to go to their house and that
place is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we met and just Manny, Adam and Gary,
all three I met at that spot on different
[SPEAKER_01]: occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that was such huge networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just friends now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got my job through that place.
[SPEAKER_12]: The manager of the place went down there
for one of our events and invited me to
[SPEAKER_12]: come meet the owner and start working.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hadn't had a job for almost a year,
so that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of work to do.
I had a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just be rolling up fat joints
and packing bong loads and then giving
[SPEAKER_01]: people dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the club provided rigs and torches and
we brought our own rigs and torches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd all go hang out and just dab out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They served, they sold like bottled
beverages like Mountain Dew and Coke and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would order pizza sometimes if
there were enough people and sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza at a fair price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was nothing wrong going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops came in one night and walked
through and I was the first person,
[SPEAKER_01]: like as you walk in the door, I'm the
first person you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at me and they kind of
grinned like stupid hippie taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't afraid.
[SPEAKER_12]: They went and talked to the owner for a
quick second and then left.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was just their normal walk
through like they do at a bar or anything
[SPEAKER_12]: else.
[SPEAKER_12]: They just walked.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't check anybody's ID.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't harass anybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't talk to anybody other than the
owners.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing wrong going on in that
place at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and that's what I'm getting at is
there were never any fights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most dramatic shit that happened in
there was our friend Wade's a comedian and
[SPEAKER_01]: he was Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the most dramatic thing I've
ever seen in that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Wade got obnoxiously loud,
but it wasn't like violently loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, dude, we're high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn down your volume loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the worst thing that's ever
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just picking on you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like really nothing ever went wrong in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were actually people as I walked in
one night that tried to ask me to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: them weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told them to get the fuck out
because they were going to ruin a good
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them, come on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't stand out here and buy weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them get the fuck out of here or
come on in because that will ruin our good
[SPEAKER_12]: time.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing went wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at the same time, there's a seven
bars within a walking distance of this
[SPEAKER_01]: hookah bar that there are fights at on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's drunk people driving home,
which of course we were probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be dabbed and attempting to drive home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead, it just seems weird that we
can't hang out and smoke a little cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in a private hookah bar setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same shit that we ran into,
are running into in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why the secret cup, the hash event
is being moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often like, we're not even going to
say where, but it has been moved to a
[SPEAKER_01]: secluded location.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be much smaller, makes it better and
makes it worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now we have to limit the vending.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to limit attendance and that makes
it less inviting to people, but it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it more prestigious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just bullshit that we can't
have a nice little smoking spot here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo or anywhere, anywhere in Colorado
where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are places that I know they do puff
and I don't want to call them out now
[SPEAKER_01]: since they're shutting down places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're doing that, be careful you
guys, keep them going strong, support
[SPEAKER_01]: those places and also tweet me where they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll, Kevin and I will get in the car
and we'll go do a little tour of these
[SPEAKER_01]: spots whenever we have a little bit of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up at iGrowCulture or at
RostageF420 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll come check out your little smoke
spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe that to all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin will come with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring some killer shatter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sound echoey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I sound echoey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's cause we got the reggae in the
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all dubbed out.
Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out once again to Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for giving me full permission to
play this CD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Kush and Coconut Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit old, but man,
it's still relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still gets going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Music is always relevant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good music is always relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that stuff that the MTV tries to
feed you is irrelevant like immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something I thought was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere where they do invite cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a statement Tuesday, and this comes
from, it just says the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really have a good author
listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a statement Tuesday, Symphony CEO
Jerome Kern says they're part of efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: to reach a broader audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna read that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a statement Tuesday, Symphony CEO
Jerome Kern says they're part of efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are part of efforts to reach a
broader audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state's only full-time professional
orchestra like others has struggled with
[SPEAKER_01]: dwindling audiences and budget problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So solution, listeners are encouraged to
bring their own marijuana to smoke or eat
[SPEAKER_01]: to the symphony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking will be allowed at the private
venue where the first two 21 and up
[SPEAKER_01]: concerts will be held.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organizers say they will follow the rules
at the final show and the publicly owned
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Rocks Amphitheater where smoking is
officially banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple things to say there,
but the last sentence, where smoking is
[SPEAKER_01]: officially banned at Red Rocks,
didn't we just have Snoop and Wiz Khalifa
[SPEAKER_01]: there and Mike Miller and Slightly Stupid
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty smoked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those nights were, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cloudy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you could smoke the fuck out at Red
Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have stopped giving a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a few years ago I walked in and
I had a bubbler tucked into my waistband
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was a gun, cause I had nowhere
else to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured I could distract him with my
hands and all my movement, my wookie type
[SPEAKER_01]: skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He let me through, but then the wind blew
and it highlighted like it wrapped my
[SPEAKER_01]: shirt up on my body real quick and showed
my bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, that's my bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, your what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, my bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked at me and he felt
embarrassed that he missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, just get out of my line and
let me go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want to like, cause he had
already let me through.
[SPEAKER_01]: His boss would have saw him pull that shit
out after I already passed security.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would have been in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so in an attempt to get more people to
come to the symphony, these guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: inviting you to bring some ganja to come
spark up at the symphony.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like symphonies, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you a symphony kind of guy?
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, the one I went to was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: What'd you go see?
[SPEAKER_12]: Beethoven's Fifth up in Denver from the
Colorado Symphony Orchestra.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was freaking intense.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like the only hippie looking kid in
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like there's all these like rich people in
tuxes and purrs and fucking super blinged
[SPEAKER_12]: out jewelry, like all these old ladies and
shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And fuck, dude, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was sitting there all stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I stood out like a sore thumb,
dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the only person not dressed up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like us that night in that restaurant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need to, they need to make more
events like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can we go smoke at the symphony,
but not at the hookah bar?
[SPEAKER_01]: The hookah bar has couches.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hookah bar has snacks and the hookah
bar plays reggae if I ask them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the point either,
but I do like that I can fucking blaze out
[SPEAKER_12]: at some symphonies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are going to sell the fuck
out, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should just let us smoke at every
concert and not worry because that's part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the musical experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've wanted, people have been enhancing
musical experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody dies at every show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I used to go see fish one
night and it was, the date was eight five
[SPEAKER_01]: 96 and fish opened up set two with space
Odyssey 2001 into Haley's Comet into down
[SPEAKER_01]: with disease into it's ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that's the order.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that little section of music there
at some point, red rocks lifted up and
[SPEAKER_01]: spun around and did a bunch of circles and
changed colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it landed perfectly back in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a little bit of concert
enhancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kind of shit that's like
part of what you go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of, yeah, it's part of the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us smoke your concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us smoke everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a sip real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some truck mouth happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get one of those waters,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually what it was there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to set it right out of reach of the
guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get real thirsty and you have that
like, I can fucking see the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're attached by the headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I can't, does that, is that mine
or is that cause it's just, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that reggae air horn right at
the drink break?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nick, for letting me play your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please listen to one podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it, make sure it's this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on to another news
section here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure I get them all in
cause I got a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of news.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I have a hard time selecting
news stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find enough news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes since I didn't do much
news on the last show with all the boys,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of news saved up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do I put my pins?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet they're down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any pins in my reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: May 1st was the day that mandatory testing
for edibles begins in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story is coming from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally written by Eric Gorski
from the Denver post.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearing my throat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the first time, makers of marijuana
infused cookies, cupcakes and candies were
[SPEAKER_01]: required to submit samples to newly
licensed independent labs for testing
[SPEAKER_01]: starting Thursday, which was May 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: If an individual individually packaged
product exceeds the legal limit of 100
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of THC marijuana's major
psychoactive ingredient, it is supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be blocked from reaching recreational
store shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manufacturers can fix the problem or
destroy the batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can donate them to the agriculture
podcast and we'll make sure that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: disposed of properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely an acceptable option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to send all of your overly
medicated edibles right this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will, uh, I will dispose of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will work very well safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to dispose of edibles the
proper way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't refresh please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so my, uh, this, I may be fucked right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, we're at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The internet's down here in my
neighborhood and the page just refreshed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've got good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came back by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, fuck you Comcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please get my cable and internet fixed
because it's going to be a long night
[SPEAKER_01]: without any internet trying to do podcasts
and post podcasts and all that good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm way off task here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So send me all of your edibles that are
overdosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the debut of mandatory potency testing
for edibles did not come without problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only two labs were cleared to start
testing Thursday and even those haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: yet been fully certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state postponed another test that was
supposed to begin and edible manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: are concerned about a lack of
standardization and results are all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: State officials acknowledged testing will
not be perfect at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the labs that are testing aren't tested
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can any of the testing be valid?
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, for us, it goes back to public
safety said Louis Kostke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just fucked up your name said Louis
Kostke, director of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement division, part of the
department of revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hold my hand up in the order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember to review that it's a necessary
step for us to ensure that the product is
[SPEAKER_01]: what it says it is on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the marijuana enforcement division,
I've talked about those guys before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is basically what it sounds like the
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to your, to the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have access to everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: They also go to like private homes and
shit too, of people who have badges.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they suspect you're doing something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_12]: They also show up with like local cops and
shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're doing anything illegal,
we might want to tell a couple of our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just so you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Kevin just said is if you're in
Colorado, and if you have, if you are a
[SPEAKER_01]: badged medical marijuana and for an M MED
badged employee, the M MED can bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: local police to your house and come to
your house and investigate to see if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were conducting any sort of illegal
activity.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys that a lot of you guys that's,
yeah, it gives a lot of you guys some shit
[SPEAKER_01]: to think about because a lot of us are
private caregivers and a lot of those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are also going to have a home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that gonna so, but we're legit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can have their home grow just as long
as they're not, if they're within their
[SPEAKER_01]: limits or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the side or beating their wife on the
side or having a bunch of guns or some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit as long as they're not committing a
crime, illegal guns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's one of the things you sign
up for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if a lot of people paid attention
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother show that we should
branch out into.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your rights get pretty effed in the A when
you apply for badges through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can come to, apparently if you're
a badged, a badged employee means that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to apply for a medical marijuana
enforcement division employee badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain levels of badging that
are required for different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: store or job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need those to do anything dispensary
related, grow related in a shop that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go recreational or medical
infused products, any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the M M E D or the M E D, the
marijuana, it used to be the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just the marijuana enforcement
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go to any dispensary and they can
also search the employees vehicles that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the parking lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can search the employees pockets if
they feel the need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the weed Nazis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones in charge of all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just the wild, wild west out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago, we're under strict
regulation between 10 and eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the wild, wild west around 2007,
like 2010 ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was nuts around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would open up a dispensary and home
growers or caregivers would bring their
[SPEAKER_01]: products to the shop and offer you,
do you want to buy this pound of weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd buy that pound of weed and put it on
your shelf like it was no thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you needed was a red card.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't give a shit back in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over regulation is making things weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to continue the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new, the new testing comes amid growing
scrutiny of the edible marijuana products
[SPEAKER_01]: with two recent deaths linked to edibles,
hospital emergency rooms, reporting more
[SPEAKER_01]: patients reacting badly to edibles and
state legislators and regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never mentioned the two deaths on my
show because I don't want to support that
[SPEAKER_01]: propaganda is honestly why I never talked
about it very much in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we mentioned the one kid jumping
one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that kid was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I avoided it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if you felt like I should've talked
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enforcement division officials say even
testing labs have been licensed and four
[SPEAKER_01]: are being certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: An additional step carried out with State
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_01]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be certified, labs must meet standards
that include lab director qualifications,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality control, security, and sample
tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of Thursday, however, none had
completed the process, state officials
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two labs receive provisional
certifications, meaning they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: material compliance, but not through the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little fly buzzing around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to smack it and I'm hitting
everything but the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I go?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: State officials, I indefinitely postponed
mandatory testing that was to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday for homogeneity, basically making
sure THC is spread throughout a product
[SPEAKER_01]: and not concentrated in any area.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spokeswoman said the division wants to
take one step at a time to ensure a
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled rollout process for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not just going to slap
everybody with huge problems if they do
[SPEAKER_01]: come out kind of wrong because they
understand the lab could be fucked up too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They understand that we have to do this
slowly just like the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: worked a lot better when it grew slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're in this big, giant cannabis
bubble and it's going to pop somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are a million fucking vape
pen companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a million edible companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like her idea of a controlled
rollout process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what we do in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go large scale right away
because it costs a lot of money and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: all grassroots companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not grab, but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that grassroots use that name,
they fucking get a lot of promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that's something we talked about
on another episode, the THC being spread
[SPEAKER_01]: through a product and not concentrated in
any area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if your chocolate bar melts,
and this is relative to another topic I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got coming up, if your chocolate bar melts
and is tipped one way and then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: re-hardened, you may have just re-stirred
all of the fucking cannabinoids to one
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good because I've got a patient
that if I gave him 100 milligram edible,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be four doses for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it all got moved to one end,
he'd be really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he'd be bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Koski said earlier this week he was
confident labs could handle potency
[SPEAKER_01]: testing for the roughly 40 Colorado
businesses making edible products for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the company has to front the testing,
not the dispensaries, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if the dispensary were required to
do it, the cost would land on the patients
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the company is doing it,
they're going to take the hit a little
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But among labs and edible companies,
there was uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There always is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how our industry thrives,
is in uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody is probably in the same
situation as me, hanging back waiting to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull the trigger on adding instrumentation
or personnel, said Joseph Evans,
[SPEAKER_01]: Laboratory Director of Steep Hill Halent,
which says it got the green light to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: the mandatory testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the guys at Steep Hill Halent
Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earl Ripper at Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Addison Demora, John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some cool guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joseph Evans also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pull myself away from a
conversation with Joseph or I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been there for like I would have camped
just to talk to that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have just sat down on the table,
bring a lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk to him all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I'll get the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we talk to Addison,
he sounds like he knows everything about
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He learned it all from Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think not just Joe, but like Joe
knows 20 times that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our buddy that sits at the table and
teaches us about chemistry, Joe would
[SPEAKER_01]: school him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no offense to either of those guys,
but Joe is fucking brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe entertains my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big to talk to that dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to next time we go up hanging out
there at the table, willing to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is show up at the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you call Steep Hill Labs and tell them
you need some information, they will
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll do some consulting for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may charge you a little bit,
but you can go up there and get some
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I paid my upfront consulting fee for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So got that account going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some edible companies fear a backlog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the labs handle the volume in a timely
fashion, said Joe Hodes, spokesman for
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie Lectures and Edibles of Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie elixirs is hard to say when you're
dabbed the fuck out, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was a 24 or 48 hour turnaround
for voluntary testing becomes two week
[SPEAKER_01]: turnaround, that significantly impacts our
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucked up that sentence, but you got the
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hodes said because of inconsistent results
in Colorado's lab testing industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie is moving to lower the dosage in its
hundred milligram products to reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of failing a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of trying to get the test
right, you're just going to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: lowball yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edible makers say samples from each batch
get widely different results from
[SPEAKER_01]: different labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meg Collins, executive director of the
Cannabis Business Alliance, said the
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency problem can be addressed with
data the state collects for mandatory
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important for the state to begin the
program and not delay it, she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are wrinkles, they can be worked
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dan Anglin of Edipure, which infuses
food products with THC, disagrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: He supports a delay in mandatory testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a company relies on a test result that
underestimates the true level of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: companies could end up putting too much,
he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're right back where we are,
overdosing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a result of trying to rush
something to appease public opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what it's actually doing is putting
harmful public policy in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state said is working to contract with
a reference lab, a sort of independent
[SPEAKER_01]: check on the process that would be used to
verify the results and practices of labs
[SPEAKER_01]: conducting the tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to hire a lab to test the
labs that are testing the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're going to have to hire a lab
to test that lab too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which makes sense, but man, this is what
happens when you freaking over-regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, because guess who's paying for it?
[SPEAKER_10]: The patients and the customers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another dollar on every product
that you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more dollar for all these tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe $1.25.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't sound like a lot,
but if you're an MMJ patient and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: already struggling because your life is
rough in Colorado or in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be fucking broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Michael Wimp, Director of Medical
Chemistry Core Facility at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Colorado School of Pharmacy and
Pharmaceutical Sciences, I'm so glad that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not my fucking title.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine having to write that or
introduce yourself that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Dr. Michael Wimp, Director of the
Medical Chemistry Core Facility at the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Colorado School of Pharmacy
and Pharmaceutical Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude said that should have come
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely important, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you release a product to people
and not know whether the label is correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the only industry that would
get away with that also, is doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Senior Enforcement Director of the
Marijuana Enforcement Division
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledged that a system without a
reference lab is not perfect, but
[SPEAKER_01]: mandatory testing and regimented testing
of the product is better than no testing
[SPEAKER_01]: at all, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other testing of recreational marijuana
will be introduced in coming months,
[SPEAKER_01]: including screening for contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part I look forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, they're trying to roll out
this thing on the first of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got to get compliant and
everybody but the labs and the system that
[SPEAKER_01]: they put in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how the MMED works sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up and wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up and wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I liked is they said that stuff's
coming up, that all of the cannabis will
[SPEAKER_01]: be tested in the future, all of the hash
will be tested in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be tested for potency and it will
also be tested for contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contaminants will be bugs, mold,
and I'm hoping that they implement the new
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that Steep Hill is using and they
are looking for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys at Steep Hill told me that
they're able to find pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you spray your plants when they're
baby clones, little tiny clones in cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: you let them grow for two or three weeks,
four weeks, you flower them for nine
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, you let them dry, you trim them,
you harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they're flushed properly and taken
care of, the kids, the professors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the scientists, the chemists at Steep Hill
Labs can find those pesticides that you
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed in your buds, in your flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can definitely find it in hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it's way more prevalent in hash
because you're concentrating everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be finding a lot of great
and a lot of terrible shit here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: very near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking to see how much music we have
on this CD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might run out of Nicka T music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit, we got like 40 songs on this
disc.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ain't got no trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Nicka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting me play your CD,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so another story connected to
our edible report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tens of thousands in product thrown away
after pot shop health inspections.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is by Boris Sanchez from Fox 31
Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we don't get a pop-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Thuy Vu, I think that's how you
say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's name is Thuy Vu, a Denver public
health inspector is changing the edible
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana business in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does she go, oops, I said he,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does she go, I think I called
that person a guy earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does she go into local
restaurants to make sure their food is up
[SPEAKER_01]: to par, she now also inspects the edibles
at recreational marijuana dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_01]: the kitchens where they are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really look at it as an infused
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at it as food, said Vu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vu, along with her team of health
inspectors, has been making unannounced
[SPEAKER_01]: visits to metro area marijuana businesses
since January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: The focus is to look closely at edible's
manufacturing process from stem to snack.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they are cultivating the plants,
asking them about different fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, and what they're using,
said Vu.
[SPEAKER_01]: At most dispensaries, her goal is to look
at whether or not edibles are being stored
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her team has had to establish new
regulations for how edible products should
[SPEAKER_01]: be kept based off federal rules that
already apply to non-similar cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: infused products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, have you ever gotten an edible at a
dispensary, dude, that you could tell it
[SPEAKER_01]: has full on been melted and they threw it
in the freezer to fix it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they're going to try to stop that
because that's messing with your health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read right after this drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a sip time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sip time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a time out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Drink time out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of dads and talking, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to records obtained from the
Department of Health, new rules have
[SPEAKER_01]: forced dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I said that, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensary owners dump out a lot of
product, including hundreds of boxes of
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles costing manufacturers and
dispensaries tens of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, so these guys had to dump out tens of
thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most prominent example, hash infused
oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vu says that oil products not being
refrigerated when they should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding that to keep products from growing
bacteria, we'd like them to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being held at 41 degrees Fahrenheit
or below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you guys that are making edibles
and having edibles, why don't you do this
[SPEAKER_01]: for us too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it at 41 degrees Fahrenheit or below
when you're storing it and that'll prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: any bacteria from growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll do us all a favor and then you
won't get any trouble from making anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one metro area hash oil manufacturer
who did not want to be identified is not
[SPEAKER_01]: too thrilled about the new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense, said the
manufacturer who had to recall several of
[SPEAKER_01]: her products and dispose of more than
$5,000 worth of edibles, though she says
[SPEAKER_01]: no one had ever become sick using her
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've personally never seen a bottle of
olive oil sitting in a refrigerator,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to me it doesn't make any sense at all,
she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: In response, Thuy says that most other
oils sold at grocery stores undergo a
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorous inspection process by the FDA,
which even the oil manufacturer admits
[SPEAKER_01]: would not happen with their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's infused product, there's no
laboratories that would touch anything of
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort, she said, adding that while the
recalls are frustrating, she believes Thuy
[SPEAKER_01]: and her team are doing the best they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprisingly with this industry,
they are extremely compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to ensure that whatever product
they are producing is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are kind of making sure that
there's quality control now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the wild, wild west like we
talked about a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't do that to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have lost one story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the next one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one article disappeared, so we're not
going to get to read too much about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can get back to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Denver Post is receiving a lot of
questions about, oh, it's going to reload.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have internet service back here
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Denver Post posted an article about a
Colorado marijuana guide, 64 answers to
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly asked questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some of them, some of the answers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you read some of the answers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are kind of hokey,
some of them are, but some of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually educational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a few minutes here, so we'll read a
couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to our give thanks portion,
and before we read a couple of political
[SPEAKER_01]: rants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some, like I said,
the Denver Post posted, I'm trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: the author, John Engel from the Denver
Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was posted, oh, this was posted,
oh, updated January 3rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of old news, and I'm just
now reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of crazy questions
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skim through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read the opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the first question,
which I've been talking about for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, did marijuana become legal in
Colorado on January 1st, 2014?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that marijuana was
actually legal in Colorado prior to 2014,
[SPEAKER_01]: since the voter approved amendment 64 went
into effect on December 10th, 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been legal for anyone 21 and over
to use marijuana or possess up to an ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana for any purpose, even if it's
just, as Rolling Stone Magazine has put
[SPEAKER_01]: it, for getting high purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana possession and use by people
under 21 who aren't medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: patients remains against the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the follow-up question, what happened
on January 1st then?
[SPEAKER_01]: New Year's Day was the first day that
marijuana could be sold to anyone over 21
[SPEAKER_01]: at specially licensed stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though marijuana use possession and sale
remain illegal under federal law,
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere else in the world has pot sales
this legal, not even Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of, they're accurate
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them props.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question is, where can I buy
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: More than two dozen shops opened January
1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: For recreational sales, we here at the
Denver Post have compiled a list of stores
[SPEAKER_01]: that opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to this article in the
Denver Post, they actually have a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to that section, find this article,
and there's a link there of dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado that are open for recreational
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy here, Kevbro, he works at a place
called The Spot in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay for any plugs or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to talk to a kid that,
I know Kevin knows a lot of shit about
[SPEAKER_01]: weed because I'd like to toot my own horn
and say he probably learned a good portion
[SPEAKER_01]: of it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found out a lot of the links and
where to find out information through
[SPEAKER_12]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I trust that he knows what he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the way because he learned it from
me and our crew, and we try to teach each
[SPEAKER_01]: other the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he makes hella good hash, so he must
be learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to buy weed,
the next question is, how does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the greatest answer, you basically
walk into a store, show them your ID,
[SPEAKER_01]: and make a purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot like a liquor store.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of normal questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there limits on how much I can buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: People with a Colorado ID can buy up to an
ounce of marijuana at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People with an out of state ID can buy up
to a quarter ounce at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question, is there enough pot to
go around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even gonna read their answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we got some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make multiple purchases on the same
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only cap how much you can buy,
it's the legal possession limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only cap on how much you can buy is
the legal possession limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one who's a non-medical marijuana
patient can possess more than one ounce at
[SPEAKER_01]: a time, but that's up to the customer to
abide by.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in the state's rules for
recreational marijuana stores that
[SPEAKER_01]: requires them to try to track the
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next obvious question is,
can I go store to store buying weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more than an ounce of weed on
you, you've broken the law at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can go get four good quarters and
then go home, smoke seven grams and go buy
[SPEAKER_01]: seven more, but if you're a rebel,
you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a list of marijuana customers
that will be given?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know the answer, but I'll read
it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amendment 64, which is a constitutional
measure, specifically forbids it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The measure states that the department
shall not require a consumer to provide a
[SPEAKER_01]: retail marijuana store with personal
information other than government-issued
[SPEAKER_01]: identification to determine the consumer's
age, and a retail marijuana store shall
[SPEAKER_01]: not be required to acquire and record
personal information about consumers other
[SPEAKER_01]: than information typically acquired in a
financial transaction conducted at a
[SPEAKER_01]: retail liquor store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means you will not be tracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be on camera though.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question, is there anything that
will show that I bought weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I smoke in the store?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can I go to consume?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really smoke anywhere in
Colorado unless you find a private bar or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read the stuff that they
said here, but Colorado's Clean Air Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: so pot smoking isn't allowed anywhere that
cigarette smoking is also banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can't smoke cigarettes,
you can't smoke weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been exceptions made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to mention them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I puff at a park somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ski slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's winter resorts are not all
stoked at the possibility of stone skiers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's more, most of the actual ski
slopes are on federal land where marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: use and possession remain strictly for
boat in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't smoke at the ski slopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means taking marijuana on a summer
camping trip is probably out too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: National parks, national forests,
national monuments, all off limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't even think of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about apartments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Landlords can say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but there are some places if you
tell them you're going to smoke weed
[SPEAKER_01]: there, they'll let you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about my back patio, front porch,
or balcony?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different cities, a lot of different stuff
is kind of the answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to read all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I send weed in the mail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, can I send weed in the mail?
[SPEAKER_12]: No.
No.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't fucking send weed in the fucking
mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't send you any weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't send you any dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't send you any slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you some dick pics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't send weed in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is working hard to get shit
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is working hard and all that shit
that leaves here is fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time it gets caught, it's fucking it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to, I've ranchered about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, yeah, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it okay to drive with marijuana in my
car?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're transporting it and not
consuming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Driving stoned is absolutely against the
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado this year made it easier to win
convictions against stoned drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state set a standard of how much THC,
the psychoactive chemical, and marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: that drivers can have in their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The driver tests above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prosecutor can tell the jury it's okay
to assume the driver was stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will my employer be okay with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read their part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to the employer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I legally possess an ounce of
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is that in practical terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ounce of marijuana, 28 grams of good
dank herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fill up like one of those sandwich
baggies just about perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's fluffy, it's not squished.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a sandwich bag full.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much will it cost is the next
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the medical marijuana market,
ounces cost from 150 to close to 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody buys full ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more common purchase amount is an
eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it like a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eights run around 25 to 45 for medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to wait and see what stores set
the recreational prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that include taxes?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I see prices being advertised
for rec shops right about 200 to 250 an
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce for good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you charge at your shop,
dude?
[SPEAKER_12]: For rec shops?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about medical prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that's totally what I meant for med
shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even walk into a rec shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I go to a shop is to get
some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a monkey bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate a monkey bar, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention that from Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking monkey bar, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well medicated.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of Pops' favorite is the blueberry
bliss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do blueberry, but it fits as good
as the monkey bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're really good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cookies and cream thing is delicious
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: On your rec side at your shop,
what do you guys sell an ounce for?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at 4.60 before tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is it on the medical side?
[SPEAKER_12]: 2.30 for non-members.
[SPEAKER_12]: 1.80 for members.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half price if you're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not really doing ounces right now on
medical because we're trying to make sure
[SPEAKER_12]: every patient has some meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a half though.
[SPEAKER_12]: We still get a half, but we're trying to
make sure we keep product on our shelves
[SPEAKER_12]: for everybody and we're not like some of
these other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only reasoning for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of questions on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I want to go over that I just
discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed to sale tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be long.
[SPEAKER_01]: In December, the state rolled out its $1.2
million marijuana tracking system called
[SPEAKER_01]: MITS for uncreatively marijuana inventory
tracking solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works a little like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every plant that a commercial grower
starts, sticks in dirt, gets a radio
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency tag, an RF tag, that moves with
the plant through its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the marijuana is harvested,
everything is weighed, then it's weighed
[SPEAKER_01]: again after drying out and at other points
during processing until it's all packaged
[SPEAKER_01]: up to leave the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, if you work there and you're
trimming, you make three piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have buds, you have trim, and then you
have trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a plant and you cut it down,
you do your harvest, and all of your stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: has to weigh what it weighed when you
originally cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have enough buds, enough trim,
and enough sticks to equal the weight of
[SPEAKER_01]: the original plant, or they think you just
stole some shit, or it's missing and it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be accounted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weighed several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the package is shipped to stores to
stores, can't weigh more than a pound,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get their own RFID tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the shop, store owners are required to
weigh their inventory every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the data is entered into the MITS,
the mitts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stores are also required to have some type
of point of sale tracking system to chart
[SPEAKER_01]: sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, every purchase at point of sale
system should have a corresponding drop in
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory in the marijuana tracking
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to the state's pot auditors to
actually scour the books and make sure it
[SPEAKER_01]: all matches up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tracking system does not have limits,
which is why officials say it's just an
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement tool, not a whole regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embarrassingly for the state, holiday
shipping delays mean not all plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial system are entered into the
MITS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show that we defeated Senate Bill 177
and 178.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tweeted a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do as much as I could,
but a lot of people sent emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people rallied.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proud of us for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to knock that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now there's a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking for volunteers to send a
few emails urging members of the Senate to
[SPEAKER_01]: vote yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote yes on Senate Bill 218.
[SPEAKER_01]: With its passage, Colorado can begin the
process of lifting up those that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: so adversely affected by the collateral
punishment associated with criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: convictions of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a template and a contact list that
I'm happy to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this will do, this will possibly
start to free marijuana prisoners,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are in jail for weed crimes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And take some convictions off of some
people's records who have already served
[SPEAKER_12]: their time and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a weed crime, that will go
away now in Colorado if you take the right
[SPEAKER_01]: steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get those email addresses by the
time this episode posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will post those up and we can vote yes
on SB 218.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Kevin Mamalji
who helps me find all these Senate bills
[SPEAKER_01]: and keeps me up to date with what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be able to do that section
without him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get into the give thanks
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost an hour into the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should time this out just about right
for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, bro, you got anything
you want to add to the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just put you like a deer in the
headlights, bro.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get some dabs going, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been a pretty fun episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about some really interesting
things, which I always like those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of getting better at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like I hear some of the news.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't always get a chance to read it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of my news update,
which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope someone's hanging out in the grow
room or driving in the car or stuck at
[SPEAKER_01]: work or commuting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm educating them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, dude, if you get the topics
ahead of time and want to text them to me
[SPEAKER_12]: or something, I can start researching some
of it and maybe find something else on
those topics.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some branches.
[SPEAKER_12]: On those same topics.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sometimes I find them out as you're
showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do think about them early.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shoot me a text, a list of them and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about my show I've realized is
I've got to get my episodes out quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: because it becomes irrelevant quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're a pretty topical show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I take a dab, I want to thank
everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a torch for you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a torch for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just throw across the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some shit go flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the thing for the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys should take a guess who we're
going to give thanks to this time while we
[SPEAKER_01]: take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's signed a book of mine, if that gives
you any hints.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does give me some hints.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few hints.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were not there when it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't think I was.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I have been at any of your
book signings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here you need a dab too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My book signings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have book signings that I go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sign books.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I know it sounds like that,
but that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I'll write a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the Grateful Dog mix that
you made or the Sativa mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some in the to-go containers and I
mixed them up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it the harder one or the softer one?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's the softer one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sativa mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's the Grateful Dog and Tora Bora
Tahoe OG Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a fat dab of it right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, take a dab with me if you're in a
place where you're able to.
[SPEAKER_12]: I notice the citrusy Sativa plants tend to
shatter up a lot more than the Indica
[SPEAKER_12]: plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something we'll have to talk about
on a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start the Grow School and
we'll have our buddy Clint back in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of episodes, the guy that asked all
the good questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we need to get him back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The music ended right as we decided to
take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quit talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, Naked T, I really appreciate you
letting me play Cushion Coconut Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Naked T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out his hash company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out his bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Select the Naked T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out his music.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev's over there coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change of colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You new with this, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp-a-licious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to quit saying the word terps,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting overused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a lip smacking dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the music was really making the
show.
[SPEAKER_12]: That tasted like Grateful Dog,
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taste the dog in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Give Thanks section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every episode we try to give thanks to
somebody who's been beneficial,
[SPEAKER_01]: influential, supportive to our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere we couldn't have gotten to this
point that we are without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody I know I could not have gotten to
this point without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, it's my left lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person we want to give thanks to in
this episode is none other than Mr. Jorge
[SPEAKER_01]: Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big love, big thanks, much respect to-
Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: George Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge Cervantes is a pseudonym for George
Van Patten, who was born in 1954 in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lived in Spain for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lived in California for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a horticulturist, horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to say right after a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a writer specializing in indoor,
outdoor, and greenhouse cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: His books, articles, photographs,
and instructional DVDs have been sold
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide as guidebooks to horticultural
techniques, to high yield closet,
[SPEAKER_01]: basement, backyard, and gorilla gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are learning how to grow weed,
you need the Grow Bible, the Indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Horticulture Grow Bible by Jorge
Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to grow weed,
get one by your toilet and get one in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just read them both constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was starting to grow, that's the
book, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that introduced me how to
grow cannabis properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I had a bug problem, Jorge's book
identified my bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I had a grow problem, Jorge's book
identified my problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge's books, he's got, I think he's got,
I probably have seven of his books
[SPEAKER_01]: downstairs that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I could go on and on about Jorge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge wrote a monthly question and answer
column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge's RX from 2000 to 2010 in the High
Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He provides the solutions to grower
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also pins a regular column in Soft
Secrets Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote a few things about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's published several books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he also published a three DVD set and
he also has a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The YouTube channel, sometimes it's
updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen a recent update,
but there's plenty of stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give big, huge thanks to
Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet Jorge one time and I caught
him off guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big line of people and he was
answering questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would answer one question for you
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's questions were like,
my clones are doing this or my plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this or how do I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've read his book, dude, and I've
been growing for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walked up to him and I said,
hey, Jorge, what kind of music do you like
[SPEAKER_01]: to listen to when you're in the garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, he was on autopilot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was signing books and just spouting
out, add nitrogen, add nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what kind of music do you
listen to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he closed my book and he put his pen
down and I said, well, that's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had to think about it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I felt like I kind of had all those
other people had a moment with Jorge,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Jorge had a moment with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shared that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, oh man, you read the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to ask me a weed question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know about Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, what kind of music do you
listen to in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: And his answer was, The Beatles,
Led Zeppelin and Shakira.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said Shakira.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't say Shakira.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said Shakira.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what Jorge listens to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're an
educated grower, go back and read that
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will teach you some shit that you
forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of guys are going to say that's
outdated shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you got to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go all advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be high tech until you learn how
to be OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge, thanks bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much the end of the show.
