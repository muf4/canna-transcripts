[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 320 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check out our friends
at PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at PLGrow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, first off,
let me apologize for my terrible sounding
[SPEAKER_00]: voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Brett, also known as Mary's
Motivation, had a going away party,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I went to that going away party,
and I smoked way too much flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: and way too much concentrate, and my voice
sounds like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of a chest cold,
I got a throat thing going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a sinus thing happening,
and before we get too far, I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize, and I want to thank you for
listening to this episode while I sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'd like to start the episode off
by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking little baby dabs of
Gorilla Glue 4 Ambrosia, and also I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the New York City Diesel Ambrosia
Batter, both from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going light today, just trying to
stay lightly medicated and not mess up my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs and throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm on the path to recovery,
and I want to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a minute ago, I mentioned that I went
to my friend Brett, also known as Mary's
[SPEAKER_00]: Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Brett's going away party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett is leaving the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett's a little scared and nervous about
his trip, but honestly, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody deserves this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett needs to make this adventure happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a great
experience for him, so I'm super proud and
[SPEAKER_00]: super excited for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His party was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the party, we were joined by,
of course, the always awesome Brett was
[SPEAKER_00]: there, Dab and Granny, and Kevin showed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Lucy, Mama Bear Dabs was there,
always good to see Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to bump into my friend Twisty Seeds,
who I don't see very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to have a conversation, a long
conversation with Chandler Dabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earl Tycoon was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude from Hits on Hand was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: LJ Fresh was there, and several other new
and old friends were there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of folks there who
brought canna gars, which are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: blunt, rolled with cannabis leaves as the
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really fucked up my lungs,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs did not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were delicious to smoke, and we got
really lit, but that is why I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: sound like crap today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Brett for the great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party was a private party,
so not a lot of people were invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event was at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shout out to everybody at
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do an event there,
every time we do a large or small party
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it goes very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is very inviting, the staff is
very accommodating, and I always have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody who came to
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra huge shout out to Brett for inviting
me, who was only able to invite 30 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to be amongst those 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great party, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked that place out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For how few people there were in there,
it was a pretty big building, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked that bitch out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear it in my voice still.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, while I've still got some good
voice left, let's do a quick podcast about
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing your plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we talk about flushing,
I should do a quick recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I talked about
determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I went fairly fast, and we got
kind of rambly, so I hope I made it clear
[SPEAKER_00]: that determining ripeness is usually done
by using some sort of a loop so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned using a 60 or 100X loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends from Instagram,
what's up, Dank Sinatra?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Dank Sinatra, sheer photo and
seeds, sent me a message, and he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I can't see trichomes with my naked
eye, but I can tell ripeness of a trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: with a 16X jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, of course, in my mind,
I'm in my mid-20s, so my eyes may work a
[SPEAKER_00]: little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, dude, you are a little bit younger
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got those fresh new eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he corrected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he can see the trichomes with the
16X jeweler's loop, so you may not need
[SPEAKER_00]: that bigger loop, that 60, that 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the 60 is working, or the 16 is
working for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need that big loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 may get you through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's recap a little bit about what
I said about harvest times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that if you have a plant that is
said to go 60 days, let it go the full 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days and start flushing at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that's supposed to
go 70 days, let it go the full 70 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: start flushing around day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may say, Rasta Jeff, I want to
dial it in and cut these plants down at
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're going to have to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I wanted to stress is this is
not your last grow with this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is your first run with
this cultivar, with this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a new girlfriend that
you've got to learn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take her out a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to see if she wants to come
down at day 60, day 63, maybe day 67,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe day 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dial it in exactly to the
right day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're going to see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use different nutrients,
you may get different ripening days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a little bit of temperature
difference, you may get a different
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to find the window
and dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is not your last grow with
this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is the first of many grows
with a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's your first run with the 60-day
cut, start flushing around day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time with a cut that
you think may go 70 days, start flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: it around day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you get to day 60 or day 70 on
whichever plant you're running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to cut it down just because
you've been flushing for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying more attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not amber, don't cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep flushing for a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to over flush than under
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you're doing is not giving
it nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten a little beefier,
but we're just trying to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how to determine when to begin
flush if you don't know the cultivar that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a brand new seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a new clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just new at growing and you
don't know when to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allowing the plant 60 to 70 days to grow
and then giving yourself extra time at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end is always your best bet with a new
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I have established how to
tell if the plant is ripe and ready to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we have a good idea of
when to start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about flushing our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think flushing is super simple and it's
something people could easily improve and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really skipping that step and I'm
not sure why because it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy step to improve your
cannabis and it is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people simply don't understand the
importance of flushing and why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you quickly why flushing
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine you've been pouring salty
nutrients into this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For nine weeks of flour plus another three
or four weeks of veg, you've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: filling it up with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring whatever nutrient
brand you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring potassium and you've
been pouring carbohydrates into these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the past 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of that stuff is built up inside
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not using all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's letting some of it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turning some of it into a gas and
transpiring some of it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of it is still in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those nutrients are left in the plant
when we harvest, dry and cure that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to taste like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed too much Kalmag, too late in
flour, you're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed your plants too much potassium
silicate late in flour, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants are not going to burn
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dry and cure these buds,
they're not going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grind it up in a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to roll a joint and it's just
going to burn black and make a funky weird
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there are leftover
nutrients that you did not flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get that stuff out of there by
properly flushing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are mostly flushing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to clean out the soil so there's
nothing left in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's soil, soilless mix,
if you've got peat, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working in, you're going to want to flush
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's rock wool, if it's cocoa,
you need to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each thing is going to take a different
amount of time to clean out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to clean that out so the
roots don't have anything to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant will start starving itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start showing its harvest fall
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will taste proper when you dry it,
cure it, and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why flushing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get all those excess nutrients
out of there, all those excess salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you roll a joint and smoke it,
you don't want it to turn into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: briquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to turn into a nice white
fluffy ash and just flake away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from a properly flushed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that also comes from a properly
dried, cured, and trimmed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that comes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're focusing on flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why flushing is important,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your herb to taste good,
you want it to burn well, and you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave a nice, white, clean,
soft ash with no weird chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's actually talk about flushing the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing the plants is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 to 14 days before you plan on
harvesting the plants, prepare the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water that you would normally water the
garden with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 1,000 watt light,
maybe you've got a five gallon bucket full
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that amount of water ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you would normally put nutrients into
the water, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, if you're going to add anything,
put some enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an enzyme, that will help
break down all the decaying roots and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the matter inside of the root zone,
and it will speed up the process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enzymes are pretty much the only thing
I would put in there other than maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one to two grams of shine from veg
bloom, but you really don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly all you would need is some enzymes
for the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to flush for 14 days,
maybe go for like four to seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: add two grams of shine and add some
enzymes, but then cut out the shine and
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep the enzymes going until the end
of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing you would put in there
are enzymes and possibly some shine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you would be probably just fine with
nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean water, add the enzymes if you're
going to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: For four to seven days, add the shine if
you'd like to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then adjust the pH to somewhere between
6.3 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine, 6.3 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good window to adjust it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then simply water the plants with that
minimal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is pour that right
into the plants just like you normally do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak the plants and let it run through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you're doing, pouring the enzymes
in there is going to help the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: decaying process happen inside that root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dead things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots that are dying are dying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes are going to eat that and
they're going to speed up that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that shine is going to keep adding
density and trichomes and essential oils
[SPEAKER_00]: to your plants if you choose to add the
shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need to flush for the last week
without the shine, you guys, so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave the enzymes in there if
you'd like to at the end, but cut out that
[SPEAKER_00]: shine for the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're probably at day 50,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to cut down at day 60,
we're at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mixed up a bunch of water and we
just soaked that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got pH water with enzymes,
and possibly some shine running through
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are going to start looking
for phosphorus and potassium and
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum and all the other things that
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 16 minerals that the plants
really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys start thinking about that and
learn all 16 of them that will really help
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about what you're feeding your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll talk about that in the future,
but the plant's going to start looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff and all it's going to find are
enzymes and shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like, well, I've got
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go beef up my trichomes,
and it's got stuff to build trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have the building blocks to
grow more plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have all the nutrition that it
needs to keep building bigger buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter stems and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to start showing you its
fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start turning into these
yellow, golden colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some unique oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like taking pictures of my plants
right at the flush phase because they
[SPEAKER_00]: really start showing great colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are nice and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are all greasy and shiny,
and then the leaves start getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: cool golden tones to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when you know that the flush is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no nutrients left in that soil
for the plant to eat, and it is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry, which is a good thing because now
you know that bud is going to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, molybdenum,
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, calcium, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have all this other
funky shit in it that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll burn nice and smoothly, and it will
taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to start seeing these fall
colors come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timing is going to depend on your
medium, how much nutrients you have been
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very strain specific,
and also temperatures are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge effect on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a little cooler in the room,
your plants are going to turn a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lower nighttime temperature,
you'll see a little more purple from the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little more fall activity
from the plants like would happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to mix up the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, depending on your container size,
and the vapor pressure deficit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, you are going to have to water
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the shine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH adjust it to 6.3 to 6.5, and water it
right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat this process right up to a week
before harvest, and then do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but simply take out the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add the enzymes, adjust the pH,
and then feed it right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the enzymes are totally not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shine is totally not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all of this with plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding the enzymes and shine,
you are going to have connoisseur quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do the shine up to the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, I would just do the
enzymes, and then I'd probably do just two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three days of plain water just to give
them time to finish up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going that 60 days, I would end
up going 63, and that last three days
[SPEAKER_00]: would just be plain water and micro is
what would happen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep repeating the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse these plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse the soil out as many
times as you can between the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: flush and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it to dry up and re-water
it every other day, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes three or four days,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still going to get, if you do it 12
days, you'll get three waterings in there
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go every four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking that much time to water,
that means you've got a large container,
[SPEAKER_00]: or that much time between waterings means
you've got a large container, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using quite a bit of water to flush
that out, which means you need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to get at least 10 to 30% runoff
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 10 gallon pot,
you're going to want to get at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: to two gallons of runoff coming out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you're flushing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get plenty of water coming out,
and then flush the shit out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it as many times as you can,
but be careful not to drown the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to sneak in another flush time
just to get more water in there because
[SPEAKER_00]: that may do more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill the fucking plant right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just drown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may suffocate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be cutting down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin it right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay on your normal watering
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you soak the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that as many times as you can in the
last 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add the enzymes,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use Shine, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only things I would really
add at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have determined how to tell if the
plants are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have determined a good time to start
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to put in the water to flush
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know why we're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically don't mix anything up,
and you run that through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will clean out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that's happening, we're gonna see
colors changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna see trichomes ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna see plants finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're gonna get a bunch of funky,
you may.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your genetics, your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get funky yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get dead leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem with just yanking that
dead stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you throw it away, get it out of
the grow room, but just pull all that dead
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff off and throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, about a week, maybe five or three
days before you harvest, go in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and just start stripping off all the
big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to save you a lot of time
when it does come time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be all these big, giant leaves
in your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut them off while the plant is
standing up, while they're still stiff,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just snap them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need scissors for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the thumb technique of just
popping a leaf off, you can just go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and defoliate a whole section really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days before harvest, go in there and
pull off all those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you a big headache and a
bunch of time when it comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang them upside down, dry them,
and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes time to trim, half the
leaves are already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will save you a lot of bullshit and a
lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them starting to get funky,
take off the dead ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, just a few days before harvest,
probably when you cut out the shine maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go in there and start pulling off the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing you might want to do is
you might want to reduce the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not create a large swing in temps
between your day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go too cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not try to create something drastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can bring it down two or three
degrees during the day and two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees during the night, do that,
but don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, don't shock the plants right at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give yourself powdery mildew right
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to mimic nature and get a little
bit colder right at the end because what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens right at the end of the season,
it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how things know, oh shit,
it's winter time and those plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: hurry up and finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see more color, you may get a
little more density, and cool temps are
[SPEAKER_00]: good for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lower the temperatures a little bit
right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing I'm sure people are going to
send me messages about and ask is,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I use any flushing agents?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not use a flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of the flushing agents are
kind of a sales tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not necessary and I think they
make your herb taste like whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to put in a new
ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not use a flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to use anything, I would just
use the solution I told you, the enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shine, and then I would add
powdered coconut water would be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing solution that I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are saying what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, coconut water would be ideal,
but that would get very expensive to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it, have that much coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine trying to get a five gallon bucket
of coconut water shipped to your house
[SPEAKER_00]: every three days for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get real expensive,
but you can buy powdered coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is readily available from a lot of grow
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build-A-Soil can take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not sponsor the show or anything,
but I know that that's a reliable source
[SPEAKER_00]: for powdered coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I should mention,
a lot of people are growing no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing in living soil
or super soil or some sort of live soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if that is what you're working
with, you probably do not need to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have created the perfect
environment inside your plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere to where it's taking up what
it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not feeding it bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being force-fed shit,
so it doesn't need to be flushed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Subcool, when he would mix up a
batch of super soil and put a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, he would just beat it water for the
whole flowering phase and he would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been flushing the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before people start sending me emails,
yes, there are some situations where you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not need to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going no-till, if you're going
all organic, flushing is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running that, you're already up
to speed and you know that we don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to teach you about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in the advanced black belt class
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I should mention
before I wrap up this so-called quickie
[SPEAKER_00]: episode that's going on for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good thing to do is to measure the EC or
the PPMs of your runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were pouring a bunch of water into
your plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect the water that comes out of the
bottom of your plant into some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your pH pen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your EC or PPM pen in there and see
what the EC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a soil or a soilless
mix, you're only going to get down so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cocoa, you can get those PPMs
down really, really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe before you start flushing,
the first day you flush, measure what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then measure each time and see how low you
can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just keep experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low it goes every day and see how
low you can get the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give any recommendations
on how low to try and get it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to vary based on your medium and I
don't want to fuck up your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn this based
on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa, you'll get it really low because
cocoa is inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa's not going to hold shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to get the PPMs of your
rockwool and your cocoa down to amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, soilless mixes, those are still
going to have some high PPMs because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are soil and soilless mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But play with your runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low you can get it and it'll be a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a fun experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll actually see what's going
in and what's coming out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should just talk about measuring
runoff anyway in a full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about checking the EC or the
PPMs of a solution before you pour it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and then we'll remeasure that
same solution, the EC or the PPMs,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes out of the bottom of your
plants and we'll compare that to the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: going in and the pH coming out and we'll
see what's happening in your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys measure the electrical
conductivity or the particles per million
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's coming out of your plant and you
will know if you need to flush more or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you cut it down,
write down the PPMs and then pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are satisfied,
hit that number next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not satisfied, maybe flush a
little longer and try to go lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be discouraged because it's not
all about the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have dry and cure to fuck this
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could ruin your whole crop after you
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank
you for listening to my flushing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we have done determining ripeness,
determining when to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next episode in line is
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we're going to do the
dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some interruptions to that
schedule because I've got an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled with some friends and things
always pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are on the chart to come up in
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for
listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me ramble for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you felt like this podcast was
educational and you learned something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would like to contribute to the
podcast financially, I would truly
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do so by going to patreon.com
slash grow from your heart and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you need to sign up will
be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really simple and I would appreciate
the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very begging for payments or
contributions or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do this podcast forever for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not trying to get rich off of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a few people who said they
would like to contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make sure there is an
opportunity for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will do with those funds is I will
pay for my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I host this podcast on my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a little bit of money to do that
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I purchased a better MacBook so that
I could record more efficiently my old
[SPEAKER_00]: computer was not efficient is the polite
way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the contributions will help to go pay
for the MacBook that I bought and also
[SPEAKER_00]: cover the cost of the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may have heard Mike mentioned
that the little microphone cover needed
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the funding for things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to contribute,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will quit begging because that got
uncomfortable quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if
you would stalk me on all of the social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is click around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply search for the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GF Y H podcast, you can find my
personal account if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: trolling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Rasta Jeff for 20 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you should check me out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I re underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do live feeds where I go on
Instagram live and I hang out and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take questions from the
Instagram live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will rant about your question and
teach you how to grow cannabis right there
[SPEAKER_00]: on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun because there's no notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today somebody asked me a fairly in depth
question and I had to stare into the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: and roll my eyes for about two minutes and
try to word out the reply I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them because I wasn't prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a lot of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like it's like a game of
stump the grower or stump the breeder or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my brain going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my grow knowledge on the tip of
my tongue and it keeps my brain active.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I had a brain injury a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do things to keep my brain
going the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm fucking ranting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys who needs a quick episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would enjoy my Instagram live
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, why wouldn't you want to check out
some dope ass cannabis photography?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got all of the videos up on
YouTube.

From Your Heart podcast on YouTube now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we are able to get a larger
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reach more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can teach more people how to grow
better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can dispel more myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can educate more people by having
another platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you support the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go click subscribe, go like some videos,
go leave some silly comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate the support because I
think that's all I've got for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a super rambly episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for hanging out
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for tolerating
my raspy crappy voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I talked it right out by the
end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally sound pretty decent now that the
show is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for tolerating that at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I'll be back Monday with a fresh
new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Texan Toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
See you next time.
Bye.
