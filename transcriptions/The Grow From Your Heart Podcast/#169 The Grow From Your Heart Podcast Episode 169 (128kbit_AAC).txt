[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 169 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is a frosty,
cold Thursday evening here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 20 degrees outside, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stay nice and warm because
the only reason I know it's so cold is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had to answer the door for the
FedEx guy and he just brought me a box of
[SPEAKER_00]: hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got some sweet new custom Grow From
Your Heart podcast hoodies, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the front left breast, there's the Grow
From Your Heart podcast logo without my
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the, it says Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the red, yellow, and green EQ
bar, like on your recording equipment or
[SPEAKER_00]: on your old school stereo to let you know
you're not blowing up your levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the back, it's got the Grow
From Your Heart podcast logo with the EQ
[SPEAKER_00]: bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got my big old face right on
there, just like the logo you see on
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes, just like that logo you see on
Stitcher, just like the logo on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Grow From Your Heart podcast
official logo, and it is now available on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of a hoodie, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in one of those
hoodies, send me an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll teach you how you can get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get one to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hoodies, of course, were made by our
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some custom printed t-shirts,
if you need custom printed hoodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you need some hat pins made,
ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse and
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are members of the cannabis
community, and I love supporting community
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find Handmade Apparel at
handmadeapparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get you all of the information
that you need to get your stuff printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get started with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you heard about them
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that I sent them your
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would both appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell a quick story about why I
really respect and enjoy the company of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Adam Hand, the founder, the
proprietor, the main dude there of
[SPEAKER_00]: Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick little rant on why I respect
this dude so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the Denver Cannabis Cup one time,
in Denver, of course, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was at a place called the Exdo
Event Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the place was too tiny for how many
people were in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me too long to park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me way too long to get in the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they searched my backpack,
they took some shit away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made me give some things away that
I'd planned on taking in, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't let me take it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to wait in line again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of frustrated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I got in there, the place was so
crowded that I literally got stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an intersection of people for several
minutes and could not go left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not go forward and I could not go
backward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not like being trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it put me in a little bit of a shitty
mood, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get out of that big clusterfuck of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first booth I come upon with
familiar faces was the Handmade Apparel
[SPEAKER_00]: and Oil Slick booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at Adam Hand from Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that flew out of my
face was, boy, this is a clusterfuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know now that was the wrong thing to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the wrong mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that because Adam Hand looked
at me and he said, brother, I came all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way from Washington for this and look at
all these people that are here having a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me about a half a second to
snap out of my shitty mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, this dude's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have had a shitty parking
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have taken away some cans of
butane out of my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have taken 10 minutes to stand in an
intersection with a bunch of high people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing nothing, trying to figure out which
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an amazing cannabis themed event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people from all over the world were
there smoking weed with me and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just needed that quick snap from Adam
Hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave it to me politely and kindly
and respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a really kind dude and he's super
polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I've been going on about
the Handmade Apparel crew for a really
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much respect, much love to the entire
Handmade crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Adam Hand and his
beautiful fiance, Ms. Jackie Oh at the Oil
[SPEAKER_00]: Slick crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I support that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love supporting cannabis community
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit kissing their butts now
and move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey you guys, thanks for the hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening, the Handmade crew,
the hoodies look freaking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the printing came out so smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: My I read genetics hoodie that I am
actually wearing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably been wearing this every day
it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day that it's kind of chilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear this probably for like a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the printing is still perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoodie's getting a little fuzzy
because it's getting worn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stitching, it's got some fuzz marks
like it's coming frayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, the printing is solid still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every bit of printing on here is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm sure that those Grow From Your
Heart hoodies are going to look just as
[SPEAKER_00]: good for just as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to doing business with you
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some t-shirts soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some Grow From Your Heart podcast
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I like to keep the
listeners updated on my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I've got a breeding
project underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few days ago, I put pollen on those
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really see the seeds bulking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how far apart those episodes
are going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to quote how many days,
but it's been several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few several days and the seeds are
bulking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the pistols on the plants are
really brown and curled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could tell that pollen got in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied so much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I kind of got a little bit
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put more pollen than I should have,
but I wanted to make sure to have a shit
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of seeds and it is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you an update and a
reminder of what I bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took in a rise F1 male that's golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat female was pollinated by a
daybreaker male that made a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that arise male and I have
pollinated cookies and cream, white widow,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey, grateful dog, and several
other beautiful females.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a flow plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got pollinated also and there are
some, um, what's, what else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other arise phenotypes in there
so that I can make more of the arise F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in about seven weeks or so,
those should be done and we'll get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what cookies and cream cross to arise does
and what white widow across to the arise
[SPEAKER_00]: will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal, you guys, that cookies and cream
plant was one of the most resinous
[SPEAKER_00]: frostiest plants I've ever grown and the
taste on it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, that plant made some of the best
bubble hash and ice hash I have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked and it yielded really heavy on the
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make shatter, we would get more
shatter than it from any other strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the problem was if you wanted bud
form, it made buds the size of like my
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb tip, just like the top of my thumb,
just little popcorn balls up the stick all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up and down the stick,
just a little popcorn balls and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty to trim and it doesn't put out a
lot of weight and the plants just kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just wispy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit it with the arise pollen because
arise makes these gigantic, huge colas and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that I can get those giant
colas with as much resin and as much
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and carry that arise growth trait
over to the colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies and cream, now the arise females
have been testing in the 29 to 31% THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of THC available to put
into this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had the cookies and cream cross
tested myself, but I've seen it test high
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's available at Kindlove and
several other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping I get that really high THC,
THCA value on the test there with that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post pictures of it when those seeds
are ready, I will grow them and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: post pictures of that on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am irey underscore genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out the progress,
there's also a whole bunch of good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: up on there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also let you guys on the podcast know
how it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my breeding update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of updates, I read an email on
the last episode from a man who wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: start a cannabis podcast in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I read that email, he has
responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read the whole email,
but I'll just read a quick portion of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, hey dude, Ross here messaging off
the podcast email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show today, some great advice,
but I must apologize though as I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually met Mrs. May, Theresa May,
our new female prime minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems she's okay and passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where I screwed up you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew I was saying something wrong
when I said it last time, it felt wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: when I said it, but he said, MP means
members of parliament are equivalent to
[SPEAKER_00]: your Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I'm sorry if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, are members equivalent to your
Congress, I think, and I'm sorry if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we do also have a military
police, but they're strictly military,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing political.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I said, excuse for the throat
clearing, he wrote a message saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: the prime minister was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what the stance was right
now because I'm talking too fast trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: read an email, but he said that the MPs
were supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know what MP stood for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the American in me took it as military
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just reading an email quickly
and trying to come up with a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spattered out military police and I
was wrong as shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: MP in this dude's meaning stood for
members of parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't embarrass your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much
by saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't trying to be offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize and thanks for correcting
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be corrected, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm wrong on something, feel free to
correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also goes on to say,
for you to say you're confident that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: the right person from how I write,
means a lot as I'm that guy who thinks he
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you don't suck at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be a great podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also goes on to talk about how he is
acquiring equipment and getting his
[SPEAKER_00]: computer ready for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he's going to record a couple
episodes and send them to me so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: give him some pointers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you get a couple of good
episodes recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you launch into iTunes,
make sure that you get all of your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have a Twitter account set
up so that you can tweet those podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe start a Twitter account now and
start developing relationships with
[SPEAKER_00]: friends on Twitter so that when you do
launch material, they'll be there already
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting to retweet your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you could work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go ahead and send me a few episodes
when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to listen to them and give
you some guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a lot of podcasts,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend all day working on plants,
so I've always got an earbud in my ear
[SPEAKER_00]: just listening to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody actually asked me to mention what
podcasts I listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I've got my phone in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just grab this and I'll scroll
through really quickly here, and I'll tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you just a few of the podcasts I listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the random emails I get,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me, what podcasts are you
listening to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go in order from the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug loves movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug loves minis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one's on here, but it may
get deleted real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Julian Loves Music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not the greatest podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spin-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a copy of Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, The Joe Rogan Experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to that more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Church of What's Happening Now with
Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Doug Stanhope Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smartest Man in the World Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fighter and the Kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Times with Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ari Shaffir Skeptic Tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burt Kass Podcast with Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's hard to listen to,
you guys, but sometimes there's good
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How Comedy Works with Wendy Curtis and
Rick Kearns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Comedy Works Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Nerdist, Truth and Eliza.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot more, you guys,
but that's mainly what I listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting to the weed section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to The Spliff Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to listen to The Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't paid attention to that one
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get a chance to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legion of Skanks is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down on the bottom of my list,
Monday Morning Podcasts with Bill Burr and
[SPEAKER_00]: FitzDawg Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, I'm not sure when I subscribe
to this, but Dean Del Ray's Let There Be
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dean Del Ray's a good comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a rock and roll dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've ever listened to his
podcast, but it's in my feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the podcasts I'm listening
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put the show back on track a little
bit and talk a little bit about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read some listener emails
because when the listener sent emails,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm answering the questions
you want to hear, and I'm actually getting
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's attention and helping somebody
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one comes from a regular listener
and someone that contacts me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's from FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, FastBerry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, really enjoy the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few quick questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did really list a couple of
few questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how long these take and then we
might read some more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might do a product review, depends on
how much time we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you always grown using bottled
nutrients and why or why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly, I use bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have reached... Okay, so I guess this is
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my best test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my best flavor and some of my favorite
crops have come from my trusted source of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used so many brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used Psycho.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Fox Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used Aurora Soul Synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the name of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be mixing Aurora and then Soul
Synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those might be two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the root stuff with like the
Buddha looking bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Dutch Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used Dynagro or Pro-Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Dynagro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used so many brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite honestly is Botanicare Pure
Blend Pro Bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa base, grow and bloom with a
little bit of liquid karma, some Cal Mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole line of stuff,
but I prefer most of the Botanicare stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Pure Blend Pro line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I added a couple other things in
there like just a couple other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably won't mention too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mainly my main mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some worm castings in there and I
put in some stuff to get the roots going a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I add my own, you know,
a couple of little proprietary things in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like a product called Humble Honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using Botanicare, put some Humble
Honey in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those things that from the bottles,
I grew a really great crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant in there got a super high
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything tasted amazing and the weight
was where I needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like I hit gold and I don't really
want to change from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, I had Sean come on the
show and he started hyping the organic as
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started showing me a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make too many trips to too many
different stores to make that happen for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my lifestyle, it wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working a full time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running a hundred and something
light grow by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have time to hit the worm casting
store, the feed store, the hydro store,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go to big order to get tubs to
mix all this shit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting a little overwhelming for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got time to do it and you can do
that, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was running a bottle crop and an
organic crop and it was kind of getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live in a house and I'm not the only
one that lives here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do some of the stinky shit
bothered some of the other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wasn't cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I lived alone, if I had, yeah,
if I was the only one ever here,
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes you can, when I mix up a
tea and I put some fishy emulsion and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in there and some Bokashi and the
stuff that comes out of the Kashi bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leachate, the lactic acid bacteria,
it stinks up the whole house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, if it's in the basement in the
back left corner, you can't be on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: story of the house on the top right corner
without smelling it because it is just
[SPEAKER_00]: rank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of why I don't do the
organics at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love, honestly, I've been reading
about it and thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to make this shift to no-till
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to be able to set up some
compost in the garage, put a worm farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garage, get that sort of a thing going
and then just use, it sounds really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome to be able to use the same pots
for every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut the plant out, shake the roots
off, put another plant in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some compost in there, some worm
castings in there and get it going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have not always grown with bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the organic as fuck method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done outdoor stuff that we just did
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did amended soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one summer where everything got
stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit talking about that
because I've had multiple summers where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything got fucking stolen and that
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all my outdoor stuff was amended soils
and no bottled nutrients at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the mad scientist feeling of it,
but I also like the amended soils and the
[SPEAKER_00]: teas because of the organic feeling and
I'm a dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dreadlocks and I like all that
natural sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have not always grown with bottles
and that is kind of why and why not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to move on to the next part
of your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like well-made bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why or why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love some well-made bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like some full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado extract company makes this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take, so we'll grow, not we,
a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow plants and take off the big
leaves and then freeze the buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them off the sticks and then freeze
the buds while they're still wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got fresh frozen buds and you
take them to, there are several companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that do it, the Colorado extract company
made my favorite so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take it to these companies and they'd
wash it for you and they keep the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time they do it, the whole time they do
the extraction, they keep your product and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's 55 degrees or it might be 65
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room is that cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your product is kept on ice the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash that comes out of there,
it's sold to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kept in a refrigerator at the
dispensary and a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hip kids bring a little cooler to buy
it because it's sold to you still cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin heads look like beach sand in
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bubble hash because that's full
melt hash and we'll take that and fold a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of parchment paper in half and put
it in the middle and heat up the carb cap
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit and roll a carb cap out
on it and it presses it out and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little, it looks like a piece of
shatter at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little thin layer of hash and
you can see through it and then we take
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs of it like that when it's pressed out
and it just burns so much more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by the passion in my voice
right now that I'm drooling over a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: dab of some good solvent-less hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love bubble hash if it's done
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is there are too many
companies not doing it correctly and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: too overpriced and it has to be stored,
kept cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do like, they take some of that
hash, that really nice 120 or 90 micron
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash and then they press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run it through like a rosin press and
the stuff that comes out of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that is delicious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out white and it looks like white
silly putty or the stuff that I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: use when I was in high school and wanted
to put posters on the basement wall but
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall didn't take nails to use this
weird goo tacky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like that but the dabs out of it
were so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be so tasty and I would get really
medicated really quickly from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a full body high.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke shatter, I don't think it
gets to my body as much as I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent-less does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, obviously I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say, you talk about your favorite
strain to breed with, oh, hold on,
[SPEAKER_00]: phone just blacked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You often talk about your favorite strain
to breed with, breed with of to make hash
[SPEAKER_00]: oil but if you had to pick a desert island
10 pack of seeds, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I think you said that I talk
about a lot of my favorite, let's see,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you kind of stumbled out some
words there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about your favorite strain to breed
with of to make hash oil but if you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick a desert island 10 pack of seeds,
what would they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna take this as if I had to pick
10 seeds, a 10 pack of seeds, what 10 pack
[SPEAKER_00]: would I pick to be on a desert island?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's a deserted island because
if it was on a desert island, it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: suck trying to grow some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I've got plenty of clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I can find some stuff to make
some organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be fish around if I'm on an
island, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to find some fish and make
some fish nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 pack of seeds, that's really,
a challenge and see this is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrate a lot of people because I've got
a seed vault of my own that nobody has
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had access to so probably something
like the lemon Jeffrey grateful dog cross
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that lemon sorbet.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 pack of that would be really cool if I
were stuck on a deserted island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog might be the one to pick dude
because it's got the flavor, it's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, it's got that stank but here's
where I'm gonna go weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is feminized seed and I don't
want to be stuck on a deserted island with
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want regular seeds so that I could
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's such a tough choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've bred probably, it would
have to be one of my creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something regular, something that came
from the Arise might be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dubwise might be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were stuck and people are like,
you never even talk about Dubwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces huge colas and it's got a
couple of good phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a really hazy phenotype and
there's a more indica phenotype but they
[SPEAKER_00]: all test high in THC so that would be
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the grateful dog were regular seed,
that would be my pick because then I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get an OG Kush leaning phenotype,
a Chem 91 leaning phenotype and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get a male and then I could breed
and then I could start doing some shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: if I had a 10 pack of seeds, that's all I
need to make magic happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just left me alone on a deserted
island, we would have N crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have out crosses, we would have
F6s eventually, I would just go nuts with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the grateful dog were regular seed,
that would be my first choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon Jeffrey grateful dog is also a
feminized seed so all my favorites here
[SPEAKER_00]: are becoming feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cascade would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I might have to say Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise might be the winner because it's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grab a 10 pack of that right now
but then I start thinking, see I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling today, I kind of want to go way
old school and say like why not some old
[SPEAKER_00]: like Brothers Grim seeds or some Mr. Nice
seeds from way back in the day because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when stuff was really neat way back
then before we started kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for a lot of random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old breeders seem to have more goals
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to have more foresight for their
breeding now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like everybody's breeding
for a lot of hype and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump on the Skittles train or whatever it
seems to be next.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so speaking of Skittles,
that leads me right into the next part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: FastBerry says, I live in Rhode Island and
can't really look hard into getting elite
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were me, what cutting should I be
looking out for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you're looking for like head
stash for yourself, you might want one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow some weight,
you might want another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need an indica, you want one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a sativa, you want another
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are trying to go for flavor,
you might want something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now what I'm noticing, everything
tangy is popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry banana tangy, double banana
tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a banana sherbet that goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a banana split.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that Crockett family farm stuff is
super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles with a Z, I think they're
calling it Skittles because they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: call it Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to spell it with a Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles is super popular right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's loving the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish one of my strains was the next
hype, but you can't just make it the next
[SPEAKER_00]: hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got to fall in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be the next hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything with tangy in it, people are
really in love with tangy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strawberry banana tangy type of stuff
is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a really heavy producer,
straight up tangy works well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more of an indica type of
tangy product, I would say the taffy was
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of stuff is what's really
popular right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to predict because one day it
was Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, it was O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you could sell was O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a bag of O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and a bag of whatever else,
that O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush would sell for first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy triple the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush of everything else because you were
going to sell that O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wanted O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was Girl Scout cookies,
then it was Gorilla Glue, then it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy, then it was Golden Goat for a
little while before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to predict what's going to be
the next hype strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I hyped up a whole bunch of that
Crockett family farm stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could also say maybe, what do you want
in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a rise, you want cascade,
you want firefly, you want morning dew,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want... No, those are all strains that
I have made and I'm just trying to push my
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which, I mean, if you want my
stuff, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a rise is a really reliable
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you want in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're in Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I know some activists and
cannabis consumers up in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am sure that they've got some elite
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to put you in touch with some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, if you need a couple of
elites, we can put some good stuff in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about clone trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people should clone hoard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes I will keep some stuff
back because I'm a breeder and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want everything out because I'm going to
breed to things and it's kind of my magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I give a clone out, I try not to
say, hey, don't give that out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like once I've given a clone out,
that clone's going places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know guys that if you tell them,
hey, don't give this out, the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to do is go, oh yeah,
and they're going to give you the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: finger and they're going to make as many
clones of that plant as they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm all about free trade cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody should have a clone
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to trade seeds for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to trade clones for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to trade clones for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how people find the perfect
strain for themselves and their gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: and or their medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think clone trading should happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can find somebody in your area or
if you can find somebody in your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you are, whoever you are,
if you can find somebody to trade clones
[SPEAKER_00]: with, I highly encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that when you get home that
you treat those clones for pests and you
[SPEAKER_00]: also quarantine them to keep them away
from the rest of your garden for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days so that if there is something wrong,
you don't go infesting the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I kind of answered your question on
what cuttings you should be looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that Crockett stuff, any iry
genetics stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, alien rock candy has been real
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's alien rock candy available,
grab that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been real popular here in Colorado
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fast Barry, let's see what else he has
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, sorry for so many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a few of the thoughts around the
old noggin, the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My address is, no, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does give me his address so that I can
send him some stickers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I won't bust you out and read that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you once again for
sending me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been friends online for quite a
while now and I do appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has a question or
they'd like to say something, feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do have a ton of emails to respond
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on answering as many of them as I
can on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got messages from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got messages from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a ton of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working my way through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only put out so much content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've secretly been working on another
project that in a few days here I may make
[SPEAKER_00]: an internet announcement about,
but right now I need to keep that under
[SPEAKER_00]: wraps, but it's been taking a lot of my
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there was not a Thursday
episode this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took last Thursday off for the
Thanksgiving holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a Thursday episode for two
weeks in a row now, but I will get those
[SPEAKER_00]: coming again once I get back on my
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got something else going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took up a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back on the flow now, so I'll be able
to put out more regular quality episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you want to hear something,
if you've got a question, a comment,
[SPEAKER_00]: just feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to take a second and
tell you guys about a service called
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently made a Patreon account for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check it out, it is patreon
.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N, so it's patreon
.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Patreon is is a service that will
allow my listeners to donate financial
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions to the podcast to help me
pay for the web hosting of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, iregeneticscolorado
.com costs a little over $300 per year for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to keep up, and that is where all of
the podcasts are host.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 100 episodes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just trying to offset that financial
burden out of my pocket by asking the
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners to contribute to my Patreon
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contribute as little as $1 per
month, and I do not think there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can put as many zeros on the
end of that as you would like,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I would appreciate it if you would sign
up at Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast has given
you some value, if you've learned
[SPEAKER_00]: something, if you've been entertained,
$1 a month is all I ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something you can do, that is
excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to offset the cost of my
website so that we can keep the show up
[SPEAKER_00]: for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sponsorships do help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some sponsors on board now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really helps a lot, but if you'd like
to go to the Patreon account, it is
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com slash grow from your heart.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's irie underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to thank everybody once
again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my boy
Hydro in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that mustache is rockin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence, and until next time,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fat dab, and give your mama a hug for me.
