[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 148 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_04]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode
features myself and our buddy White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you follow White Mike's Facebook
page, Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you support all the sensible
cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, I don't want to do too long of
an intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to let the music play.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be joined by our good friend White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's how the podcast is going to
start is with a big fat fuck blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, we are back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to stay at the studio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can this officially be a studio?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when all the gear is out,
we can call it a studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today we've got the pocket studio.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're recording on the ... My mouth is
fucking high.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brain's not as high as my mouth,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're recording on the Zoom H6 Handy
Recorder, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a little test run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that I've got this
figured out because I'm going to go record
[SPEAKER_04]: with Dad and Granny again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here on the podcast with me in the
makeshift pocket studio is our buddy White
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this part that I always like to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell everybody that's listening where they
can stalk you on social media so that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can check you out while they're listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on
Facebook and at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of stuff are we going to see if
we go to the Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: Laws Facebook page?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much any marijuana news related
event I can find that's even remotely
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant to the US gets linked up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what you do for the cannabis
industry and for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a working man and I'm always at a
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that listens to the podcast
regularly knows that I am the lead
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivator of a hundred light facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that keeps me busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a day job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the politics happens during the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when there's politicking to be done,
when there's people have to go to city
[SPEAKER_04]: council meetings and speak and show
support, when that stuff is to be done,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is the guy that goes and does that in
my place because I am stuck at the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for doing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having a Facebook page to keep
our community together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to all the people that help with
Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's organizations and all the people
that join up with Mike to go to all these
[SPEAKER_04]: rallies, to go protest things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to all those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are a couple of pro, what's the
word activists in town?
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't think of the word activists.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of nice that I'm not totally
alone anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to give two or three of them
some shout outs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that may deserve a big fat thumbs
up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Juicy J has been doing a lot of stuff on
social media that I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy named Brooks that's been
doing a ton of stuff on social media right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of great infographic memes for our
side and our fight down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been doing some amazing work and I
really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of his work shared to my page has
gotten record views and shares and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Juicy J and Brooks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to those two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for supporting the cannabis
community, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need people like you on the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, dude, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You showed up with this orange flavory,
citrusy, grapefruit hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a little more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Clementine Sugar Wax from Rockin'
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new Pueblo company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took it to just as something fun to take
along with me to a meeting with several
[SPEAKER_03]: dab kids is the wrong term, but it's the
closest one we got, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several folks getting together dabbing and
it ended up being the talk of the table,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I thought was funny because we were
dabbing raw turps on distillate that
[SPEAKER_03]: night, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the fucked up throat,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been taking dabs like we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a live resin or is this a fresh
frozen product?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do you know about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually not sure on that particular
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big pitch of this company is it's a
proprietary mixed gas extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That explains a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that knows a lot, not a lot,
but that smokes a lot of different types
[SPEAKER_04]: of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell that that's why I asked if it
was live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the color and texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color and texture are not what I'm
used to seeing from a butane extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: unless it's live resin, but that is very,
very close to what I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you call that color?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I don't know what color that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Butterscotch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a butterscotch color.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good description of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not orange, it's not yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was fresh, it had a little more
orange, yellowish pop to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a propane-butane mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the propane happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is legitimately the first propane
hash I've ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it made.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great Vice Media documentary
where they go and interview a guy building
[SPEAKER_03]: a propane extraction rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash that comes out of that is
frighteningly orange, like cheese and
[SPEAKER_03]: orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've smoked a bunch of propane hash oil
from our friends at Altitude Organic
[SPEAKER_04]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me for that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've smoked a bunch of propane hash from
Altitude and it's always white,
[SPEAKER_04]: completely white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of mushy and it always tastes
really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I don't like about it is it kind of
makes my lungs feel sort of heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives me a butter lung sort of feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I over dabbed myself with some of this one
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I way overheated my banger and took an
insanely hot dab, just not paying
[SPEAKER_03]: attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one I'd taken a little cool,
so I was a little Johnny on the spot
[SPEAKER_03]: taking that dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: While I was coughing, the cough seemed to
go on quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a minute, I considered, is it the
mixed gas?
[SPEAKER_03]: But from everything I've seen,
all the lab testing, it's totally clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about lipids and plant fats and
all that kind of stuff on an episode
[SPEAKER_04]: previous, so I wonder if there are plant
paraffins and lipids and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: left behind in there that they're not
taken out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it's marvelous hash is what I
wanted to get to.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flavor is insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: At first, it was like orangey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I waited a few minutes and as my
mouth dried up, it turned to grapefruits,
[SPEAKER_04]: just straight up grapefruits on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to take a drink for a while,
but I had to because I was so confident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've still got the grapefruit coating now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job on bringing the good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Rockin' Extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said they're a Pueblo company?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're right up the street from the
shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're good guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make several different products that
I'm enjoying right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their deliveries better always be on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they walk them over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do that legally with the manifest?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you walk over a product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make it a couple of different
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've also got the first vape pen
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually not felt bad about spending
money on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it come in flavors or is it just one
flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's just a single extract run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mixed batch, no strain specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativa or indica?
[SPEAKER_03]: A hybrid blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means they just threw a bunch of shit
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feeling it's half Clementine,
half Blue Dream is honestly what I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been enjoying the hell out of the
Sugar Wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super tasty hash, high quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys go into your local weed
store, if that's the thing where you are,
[SPEAKER_03]: ask them what new stuff is in and check
out new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get set in a total routine.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of new cool stuff coming
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should check out what's new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stepped out of my little box.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really familiar with Turpex.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow the product at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take it to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_04]: They turn it into concentrates for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wouldn't I buy that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately, I've been buying the Kraft
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kraft makes really good products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting Extracts Ink.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what they're called,
Extracts Ink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they make really good products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some Darth Cookies the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been stepping out of my normal 710
Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Viola.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get the right batch of Viola,
it'll taste really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, check out new shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid to try new stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get a quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd spend a lot of time going through the
edible section, making sure I tried one of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing the same thing with the hash
lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun watching you step up your hash
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so expensive piece by piece,
but I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You started off, I think I gave you your
first dab, probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was downstairs on the swing arm
skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in those days, the hot oil days,
the syringe of black CO2 oil on the
[SPEAKER_03]: dabber, on the dental pick dabber days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those days when they were selling us
dental pick dabbers at the events for the
[SPEAKER_04]: price of dab tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just old dental dabbers from
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to see you've stepped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You went from taking little tiny dabs of
just booboo to now you take pretty good
[SPEAKER_04]: sized dabs of some clementine sugar wax,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you a decent sized dab of some
pineapple jack set up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to make you cough pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last pineapple jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which company made this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Terp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is from the Terp X.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shop got in a shipment of that a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up with eight of them at home by
the time we sold out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a backstache.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably grew that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really great strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually New York pineapple diesel is
what it would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pineapple diesel cross on accident,
I think, but there were a bunch of seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what came out as that phenotype
and it grows like a fucking savage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been talking for quite a while
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we've gotten into any sort
of topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd say this dab, you let the
listeners know what the topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first time I'm going to read a
couple of email, maybe two depends on how
[SPEAKER_04]: long we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read one email.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should find my phone because it's on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to remind everybody that I did
promise everybody a podcast about the dab
[SPEAKER_04]: and granny or featuring the dab and
granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recorded that podcast at the Canna
Canyon and unfortunately I got home and my
[SPEAKER_04]: memory card would not let me pull the
files.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would let me drag the files from the
memory card to my desktop, but they will
[SPEAKER_04]: not play.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't play from the memory card.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't play from the desktop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even took the zoom H six and ran the USB
cable to the computer and tried to open
[SPEAKER_04]: the files that way and use it as a file
reader.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far with my tech skills that that shows
lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I've done is I set up another
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not going to tell you when,
cause you might show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's creepy, but in the future dab and
granny, myself, Brett, Lindsay,
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe a couple of the folks are going
to congregate at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is going to cough his face off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang out, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to run, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave your mic on and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, you should see him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's tomato red, turning purple again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but we're going to record the dab and
granny podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stick around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be coming up in the, in the very
near future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we're going to read that email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that the one thing I wanted to talk
about with Mike, the main thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause Mike is our smart friend that comes
over with smart shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the DEA has
failed to reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, cannabis is still considered a
schedule one drug, which, uh, let me,
[SPEAKER_04]: let me tell you what that means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Schedule one drugs are the most dangerous
drugs with the most potential for abuse
[SPEAKER_04]: and psychological dependence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now cannabis still is in the same
category as LSD, as heroin and ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it coming a mile away, but I'm still
a little disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 90 days ago, the DEA said that
they were considering rescheduling
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They taunted everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: They teased us.
[SPEAKER_04]: They made us all think that there may be a
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 90 days, they just said,
Oh, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a change and it is big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not as big as the media made it
sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they didn't reschedule cannabis,
but they did open up, um, more research,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, gross production sites for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for pretty much everybody listening
this whole lifetime, the feds have been
[SPEAKER_03]: growing marijuana for research purposes at
the university of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still dabbed out, but, um,
uh, that's the only farm that grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've been watching Sanjay Gupta's
weed one, two, and three specials on CNN,
[SPEAKER_03]: they covered the research restriction,
uh, topic pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, uh, there's only one farm
growing research marijuana in the U S
[SPEAKER_03]: which means there's almost no variety of
cannabis to research in the U S they've
[SPEAKER_03]: only got four strains or some really
restricted numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lungs are still going a little nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear it, but you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying you're making enough sense
to make it matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys are following along.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying really hard not to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it right into the mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing really well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should see the look on his face.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll, I'll jump in for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes you dumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nonsense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys that, uh, that cannabis,
I've seen the cannabis that they grow at
[SPEAKER_04]: that facility there in Mississippi and
it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have a proper grow facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have proper technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have good genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen what they're doing and it isn't,
it's an embarrassing growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: My girl looked like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would put matches to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be ashamed of what they were
producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw the last footage in there,
there's, you can pull up some footage on
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube, what a lot of it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you listen to the researchers
talk, they tell you, well, we can produce
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that's requested.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can mix a batch of 19% THC or 10% or 4%
or 12%, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at what he's talking
about, he's basically like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: we just grind up enough leaf and stem in
there to bring the 21 down to 12 or the
[SPEAKER_03]: grind enough, but over the 4% until it's a
9%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, yeah, it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen their facility and I don't think
they ever passed 15%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the feds have run a medical marijuana
program since 82 where patients get
[SPEAKER_03]: mailed, uh, 11 ounces each of pre-rolled
joints, uh, every month and like a coffee
[SPEAKER_03]: cam, like a really cool coffee tin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a, those are collectible in
the U S now, cause you can find them on
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay from time to time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and one of the federal patients that
does a lot of public speaking will give
[SPEAKER_03]: them away for, uh, charity events like
silent auctions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, um, the marijuana that those
patients get is from this farm and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, some of the video of it, especially,
uh, that was taken at like conferences in
[SPEAKER_03]: the late nineties, early thousands,
the quality is just atrocious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they have to unroll the pre-rolled
joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rehydrated in the fridge, like old hippie
style with a piece of lettuce or a piece
[SPEAKER_03]: of bread to bring the moisture content up
real quick and then reroll it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Mexican brickweed from America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they, yeah, they need to hire
somebody that, Hey guys in Mississippi
[SPEAKER_04]: hire me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten a lot better since a lot of
that footage was shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, did you see the CNN footage?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know it well enough to discuss
quality from that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the footage that I saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: They walk into the room with like,
it looks like a shitty led and they've got
[SPEAKER_04]: like a small hydro table and the plants
just look sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the plants totally look sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's definitely not like, uh,
Colorado commercial production quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not homegrown quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the guy we went to his house and
he had those super stretchy plants with
[SPEAKER_04]: the UFO light above them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it made me think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of that dude's grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, that guy's growing over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some struggle buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't be very struggle buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't be very, very good quality by
the looks of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there, the DEA claims that cannabis
does not have a, uh, a currently accepted
[SPEAKER_04]: medical use in the U S and there is a lack
of accepted safety for its use under
[SPEAKER_04]: medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a high potential for abuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, all of that is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, what, why aren't, why aren't
Mike, why isn't the DEA smart enough to
[SPEAKER_04]: see that all of that is bullshit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they totally do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's their, what's their motive?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have anything to do with
marijuana itself and everything to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: succeeding power, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, marijuana being illegal is an
amazingly powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does several things that they want to
keep happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if they lose that stick, they lose a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there are a lot of things that are
built on that pyramid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They crumble after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the pharmaceutical industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there are definitely financial
interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the prison, is it the prison
industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's been some good reporting
lately, um, Washington or I don't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: which paper, but, uh, looking at the major
lobbying efforts recently against
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana rescheduling against marijuana
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that's coming from alcohol
and pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alcohol, pharmaceutical, prisons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, there's a big report out
recently that legal marijuana states and
[SPEAKER_03]: medical marijuana states saw huge
reductions in Medicare and Medicaid
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription billing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it was in enough states and over
the same timelines to draw causation
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not a one-to-one like mathematical,
um, conclusion, but enough to infer that
[SPEAKER_03]: where people have easy free legal access
to cannabis, um, they can just swing by a
[SPEAKER_03]: store and get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically they consume significantly less
prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a huge loss to a major
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when 20-something males have,
uh, marijuana that they can go buy at a
[SPEAKER_03]: store, um, they consume significantly less
alcohol on weekends.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mic sounded really hot.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, when, uh, I got my first medical
marijuana card, I told myself and my
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and my family, I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smoke all the cannabis I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here it is probably six, seven,
eight years, maybe later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't drank since I started using
medical cannabis since I was able to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: the dispensary and point at that jar and
say, let me get an ounce of that tastiness
[SPEAKER_04]: right there and go home and roll up and
puff down as hard as I want without any
[SPEAKER_04]: worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause back in the day, I didn't know where
I was going to buy my next weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to preserve that ounce cause you
paid way too much and you don't know if
[SPEAKER_04]: that dude's going to have good weed or not
next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can medicate as needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to drink any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like being drunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm no good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm really good at it or
really bad at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the case is,
but I know that it's not my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wake up hung over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And regretful when I smoke cannabis,
I've got a very similar story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, I quit drinking before I had a
medical marijuana card, but essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: the same thing is I got really good at
drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I decided that I didn't like some
of those character traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to take a couple of days
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple of days became a week and now it's
been like eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I went to Mardi Gras lad two years
ago and had three beers, like just like
[SPEAKER_03]: with dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because I was there and I was at
sea level and I wouldn't feel the
[SPEAKER_03]: repercussions of it the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would have had, I had up three
beers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that where Davey happened bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we found out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found out about Davey the day after we
got to new Orleans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so the one didn't have any alcohol the
whole time on the trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of how we found out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the, the day we got there,
she, she took a sip out her first drink
[SPEAKER_03]: and got queasy and was like, man,
and then the second day, same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after the second day she was like,
go to Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were in new Orleans for 10 days
and we found out we were, we were pregnant
[SPEAKER_04]: on the second day to get to celebrate
while you're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh, it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We celebrated the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a truckload of good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither of us are real heavy drinkers
anyway, so it's not like we're missing out
[SPEAKER_03]: on anything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I had a great time and I had
a lot to celebrate, but yeah, I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really drink and a lot of it has to do
with, I can relax and unwind with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a much better unwind.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, there's no penalty the next
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I hated about drinking is
the incredibly bad decisions I would make
[SPEAKER_03]: while drinking and then waking up the next
day, getting home while you're drunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just figuring out how to get home dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to drive?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to take a taxi?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to jump in one of my drunk
friend's cars?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so many nights, so many nights,
so many mornings I've woken up saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so thankful that I made it home last
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to someone today who's like,
I quit drinking this morning and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I hear it a lot when you get to six
months holler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the point we're at here is people
are consuming less cannabis or consuming
[SPEAKER_04]: less alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're consuming less pills because we
are able to access cannabis safely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's, there's a lot of people who
don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of people who don't want
to lose that lever of control on people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's an immediate excuse to get to
further a car stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I smell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's not one video on YouTube
where the cop goes, I smell heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to smoke cocaine or I smell
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that video doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never gets said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I smell a gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think I smell someone you're
smuggling in your trunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to search your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That video doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single video is, I think I smell
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that steps away, everything for law
enforcement gets a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so true because I recently got
pulled over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about it on the show and the
first thing that cop said was,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you have any marijuana in the vehicle?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to reprogram my brain real
quickly because first I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, sir, there's no weed in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I was like, wait a minute,
that's 2016, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your badge on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your purple card in your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked him straight in the face and
I go, it may be because I wasn't certain,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there may be, there could be weed in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, it smells really strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, I work at a grow and
just being honest with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That changed everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had no problem to mess with me now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does take all the stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a criminal anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I used to do wrong was have
a bunch of weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those first couple of law enforcement
interactions are bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's almost a genetic response with
this community at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because if we admit to being part of
the cannabis community or having cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: or supporting it in any way, we subject
ourselves to all sorts of horrible things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in Colorado, that's not true
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as those realization sets in,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been to any event or a place
where you have consumed cannabis near law
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement and they've watched you many
times before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, uh, I was up in Denver in Boulder
during the hay days of the Boulder smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: out on four 20 in the civic center,
um, gatherings on four 20 where,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, tens or hundreds of thousands of
people get together all at once everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: lights up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of as a dare, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 10,000 of us arrest 11 of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like we're going to peacefully sit
here and smoke pot and play bad music and
[SPEAKER_03]: then cheer at four 20 and all smoke pot
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there'll be a big cloud and by five o
'clock we'll all be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the shops in the area that sell food,
we'll all make an extra five grand,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 grand that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, everybody except people that have to
take public transportation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or commute during those hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but, uh, Uber drivers are making
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a hundred thousand people just
convened at civic center.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the, the cops stand by and they always
had, um, and just kind of made sure
[SPEAKER_03]: everything was calm and collected and
nobody got out of control and it was fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, post legalization,
only a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I've been too busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always end up working those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not the guy that goes to all the
events.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not that dude there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I desperately want to go to like the next
secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get out and enjoy a few events
now, August 27th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that Davey's a little bit older,
I can start doing that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be so much fun pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I remember the first time, uh,
we used to go to smoke nights at the cloud
[SPEAKER_04]: nine hookah bar here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked about them on the podcast way
back in the early episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that was back in the, in the day
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, since then they've shut them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do that here in Pueblo anymore,
but we were at the cloud nine hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was sitting, I was at the bar,
which is it's an old bar, but it's now
[SPEAKER_04]: turned into a hookah bar, but they didn't
change much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's still got the bar seating.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just put hookahs out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I was sitting at the bar and there was
one person and then me and in front of me
[SPEAKER_04]: is my little oil slick pad, my rig,
my torch, my little variety of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hitting a bowl or at a bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in a bowl that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bowl, some flowers in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bag of weed next to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I was just chilling, just sitting
on the bar stool and the cops walked in
[SPEAKER_04]: three of them together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I heard the radio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always hear the, and then they walk in
and I was like, ah, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought we fucking sit here,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a 21 year old.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're over 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a red card in your pocket,
a purple card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The owner of this place is who's going to
have to fucking deal with anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those cops walked right past me and they
went and talked to the owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: The owner nodded and smiled a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all shook hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cops walked past me and they kind of
looked at my, uh, what I had sitting on
[SPEAKER_04]: the table, like they looked at it more
curiously.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, huh, okay, that's what
smoking hash supplies look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they walked past it and they nodded at
me and they kind of smiled like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up stoner?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of them kind of condescendingly
smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: You weed head, your high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other two just kind of nodded
politely.
[SPEAKER_04]: They walked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the kids that was there was a
younger dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just, just being a typical dude,
I probably would have said the same thing
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking 15 years ago, but as soon as they
got outside, he goes, man, fuck the
[SPEAKER_04]: police.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked at him and I was like,
bro, unfuck those police.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't take my hash and we didn't go
to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you were the first motherfucker they
saw when they walked in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it was like, I had to remind him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we didn't go to jail for that dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like two years ago, they would have threw
me on the floor, like just for having that
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are, there are a lot of people
who don't want to give that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why you see things like the DEA
make decisions like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's just silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they, uh, if they would have
rescheduled cannabis to a schedule two
[SPEAKER_04]: substance, what that would have mean,
what that would have meant is it would
[SPEAKER_04]: have now been allowable for prescriptions
by all medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'd be able to write you a
prescription for cannabis basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and they'd also, it makes research
significantly easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, I hate to keep going back to
CNN specials cause CNN's usually obnoxious
[SPEAKER_03]: as all hell, but their marijuana reporting
that they've done has been spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's easy to research cocaine in the U
S because it's a schedule two drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to, it's easy to research
schedule two drugs because, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: their schedule two, if they're schedule
one, significantly more red tape,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, much, much harder to research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, I mean, it takes years of going
through approval meetings and submitting
[SPEAKER_03]: paperwork years to just begin your study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then in studies take years to
complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take more years to, to write the
conclusions, examine the data,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that, and then more years to
publish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you add another decade of red
tape at the beginning of all that
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana research, which is something
that's not going to happen until we're old
[SPEAKER_03]: men.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that's because it's a schedule
one drug and, uh, moving into schedule two
[SPEAKER_03]: changes on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, any competent researcher can submit
the paperwork and, and within a relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable amount of time, begin
researching and none of those changes were
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even though they created more
places to grow it in the selection of
[SPEAKER_03]: research grade cannabis that's available
to be researched, will it be expanding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, access to that material won't be,
and that's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why I, I, I rant and tell
people to vote because none of this shit
[SPEAKER_03]: changes until a, most of the people
involved in this have gotten old and died.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we just have to wait until the
generation that's so tied to this,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, has seceded power to our generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just going to take another couple
of decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in the meantime, we need more
people in our generation politically
[SPEAKER_03]: active.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many members of our community tuned out
because if we spoke up about what we
[SPEAKER_03]: believed in, we went to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was scared, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, you would be like,
come to these little city council meetings
[SPEAKER_04]: with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, I grow and that I'm
scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and that's part of the reason I
became the politically active one down
[SPEAKER_03]: here is because I didn't physically have
the space to grow, um, or the money for
[SPEAKER_03]: the startup equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I didn't like go ahead and shove my
ass to the warrant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get searched all 12 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with the dirty laundry prick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, I could have cops show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have cops pull me over and demand
to search my car and I'd be okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, most of the time, but, uh,
I w I was able to risk it where a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: other people in the community simply
weren't in a position to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but one of the, one of the really
interesting things that I noticed when I
[SPEAKER_03]: spoke out, um, is that it gives you a
shield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when you go to city council meeting,
reporters for the local paper are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in a major city, reporters
from major papers are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when the guy that comes down to city
council or the county commissioner
[SPEAKER_03]: meetings, it makes really coherent,
articulate arguments, um, in the
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate manner and setting for
marijuana gets his house raided.
[SPEAKER_03]: They break a bunch of furniture,
rough him up, shoot his dog and don't find
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit makes the front page of the
Washington post every day for a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's not universally true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not being granted immunity by a
judge, but it does provide you a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant layer of protection because by
becoming mildly public, um, you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're granted some of that protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the DEA failed you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was my point of that topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to move on to another topic here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, thanks for having a whole lot of
info on that one for supporting me on that
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Y 'all just learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I rambled a lot, but you like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both, both happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it is now Wednesday, August 17th as we
were recording this, it just passed
[SPEAKER_04]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, right now it is August 17th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Gibbs Gibbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you listen to this
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great being your friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should hang out more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everything is going well for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy fucking birthday, giblet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, also today marks the anniversary of
the first time that my friend Amanda and
[SPEAKER_04]: myself took dabs together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda has been in Colorado for one year
now, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what Colorado would be like
without you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad you showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking friends forever there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to get all sappy on everybody,
but some, uh, some landmarks to note.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to Gibbs and Amanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad you're on my roster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I said I was going to bring an email
to the table to read.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a screenshot of it cause it's much
easier than going and searching through
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read this message to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one says, uh, first of all,
he said sucks that, uh, sucks about the
[SPEAKER_04]: granny podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you killed it with the emails
though, and we love your updates on your
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should give you guys a quick update on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I said I would do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the male plant, we are now,
the date is now the 17th.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are now 14 days in, you guys,
the male plant just started sprinkling a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of pollen, little itty bitty
bitty bits of pollen are coming out of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The girls are just starting to go into
full flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see their calyx pistols are just
going nuts right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stretch phase is in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Full fledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they'll quit stretching in about a
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let them get pollen in about seven to
10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start getting a lot of pollen on
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got pollen in a jar for backup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also got that male throwing pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're looking great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is going beautifully on the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is on schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot to report other than the
male is balls are big and he's just barely
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to dump pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this message says, I was wondering what
you know about Fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really understand what is
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether it's a good or bad thing,
uh, when it happens, maybe a good show
[SPEAKER_04]: topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I replied with great topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a message that actually came
from a friend on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: The email has been killer lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a lot of topics, a lot of content
from the people that are sending the
[SPEAKER_04]: emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me your emails guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them to me at grow from your heart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the easiest way to reach me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's easier if I filter all the
questions through that one channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read your questions wherever they
come from, honestly, cause I know you're
[SPEAKER_04]: not, uh, some of us are friends on
Instagram, on Twitter, on whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, wherever we're friends, I'll read it,
but it's easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got more of a chance if you hit me at
grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy wants to know about Fox
tailing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fox tailing is when you're growing a bug,
some buds and they start popping off like
[SPEAKER_04]: little Fox tails and little fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just get, they start spreading out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them Cheeto fingers too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheeto fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Fox tails is the appropriate
term.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some strains it's genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if the bud stays compact, if it's
tight, and it's doing what looks like a
[SPEAKER_04]: Fox tail more like a crown, that's
genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's, if the bud is airy and you're
getting Fox tailing, that is most likely
[SPEAKER_04]: from too much heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually what that's from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plants are probably too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably a little bit too close to
the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming with that Fox tailing,
you may see a little bit of taco leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, your leaf will look healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll look cool, except on the edges,
it'll be folding up like a taco shell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could just make a little taco out
of your leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those are visual descriptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're seeing both of those,
it certainly is too hot in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've seen it most often when,
uh, we call it kissing the sky when the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants grow up into the light while
they're in bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably what's happening to this
guy's poor plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if that's not the case, Fox tailing
could be from too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to spread out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the grossest description I could
give you, but it's completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike knows where I'm going with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, imagine you're in Las Vegas in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 114 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, your man junk tries to just move away
from your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your balls want to get away.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants are too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to get away from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're starting to sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just trying to peel off of each
other so they're not getting sweaty and
[SPEAKER_04]: funky and compacted in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants just trying to make some air
room for itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's trying to get spongy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Fox tailing out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to get fluffy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's going to get, it's getting heat
stressed is probably what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you could be overfeeding it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That also could, could make Fox tailing
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those three.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's nine times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plant hit the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some jelly bean phenotypes like to
make a crown shaped Fox tail, strawberry,
[SPEAKER_04]: banana, Tangy likes to make some crown
shaped Fox tails, Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I guess it's a lot of things crossed
to that Calio.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was with the lemon haze phenol that
did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it got within eight inches of the
light, it was a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the plant would drip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so the grower wouldn't get rid of
it because it would just literally when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're harvesting, it would just drip THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The closer, if it got within 10 inches of
the light, it would Fox tail like mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So chances are, bro, your plant is getting
too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if that, if that's not the case,
send me a follow a message and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about it on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly do appreciate the interaction with
my listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me more questions, more messages.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to read one more email.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's going to be quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm finding it on my phone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did take another screenshot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one says, Hey, I was listening to the
podcast today and I heard you answer my
[SPEAKER_04]: questions on the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's from Mazer four 20,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said it was a trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he said, thanks for that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I say I work with robots,
I just meant they act like robots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause remember I act, I asked,
I was like, are they real robots or
[SPEAKER_04]: there's people that act like robots?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he said, I kind of like office
space, but different.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I got another question for the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping you could shine some light
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it says show questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, what are your thoughts on my
monster cropping?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he said, I read that it's great
to use for Scrog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't know a lot about monster
cropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you got to do is send me another
message and tell me what monster cropping
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you my opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll learn about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tell me what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what you mean by monster
cropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of things that could
mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be by like snapping the stems
and bending them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's what you mean, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it takes too long for my type of
growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two question.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I was curious to hear your
thoughts on LEDs, any experience using
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any personal experience with
LEDs, so I don't have a lot to tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you that it changes the way
your plants function.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use their nutrients differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: They drink differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen friends run side by sides with
LEDs and HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the LED plants and the HPS lights
looked completely different being fed the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They photosynthesized differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole new thing to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any experience with it
personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't guide you on any lights to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spend a lot of time researching light
spectrums and their effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that'll answer some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only seen them really successfully
regularly used as auxiliary color
[SPEAKER_03]: augmentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're a primary light source,
every harvest I've seen has been
[SPEAKER_03]: minuscule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give a shout out to my friend Nancy
Budwell.
[SPEAKER_04]: She grows with a very specific brand of
LED lights and she kills it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her plants are gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've only ever seen the cheaper ones
in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen the $1,800 version.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lights that Nancy are using,
those lights are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're $1,000 to $1,400 lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: LEDs can be extremely expensive,
but allegedly you pay for it in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: year in electrical savings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to throw it down on the table to
walk out with that light, but you're not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to have to pay the electric bill
every month like I do with my HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't have to run as much
electricity on an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge power saving there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen them effectively used
alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out Nancy Budwell on Facebook or
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is a representative for a specific
lighting company.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has great pictures and she will guide
you through your purchase of an LED light
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's something that you're really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a third part to this question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, also wondering what are your
thoughts on hempy buckets and deep water
[SPEAKER_04]: culture?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the pros and cons and your likes
and dislikes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not super experienced in deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember our friend from Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude grew some deep water culture
buckets and did some great work.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem was if something goes wrong,
everything goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your pump goes out on that deep water
culture pump and you don't spray for three
[SPEAKER_04]: or four hours, if it quit spraying,
your plants are going to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the major dislike to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy had five gallon deep water
culture buckets and his plants were taller
[SPEAKER_04]: than me and I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were putting on weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were packing it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only problem is he had a lot of fungus
gnats all the damn time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He could not get rid of the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done it myself, so I don't have
a lot of experience, but that's what our
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaiian friend was experiencing from what
I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of time researching
different growth methods and this one
[SPEAKER_03]: scares me because of its complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing with hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more complicated it gets, the more
random things might fail and cause your
[SPEAKER_03]: crop to suicide when you're only on for
six hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm a soil grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, soil is insanely forgiving and
part of the reasons for that are what make
[SPEAKER_03]: me favor it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about deep water culture a
little bit because there might be people
[SPEAKER_04]: out there going, what the hell is deep
water culture?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, deep water culture is a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do multiple site deep water
culture buckets and you can have a main
[SPEAKER_04]: reservoir that feeds multiple buckets,
but for a one plant deep water culture
[SPEAKER_04]: bucket, you've got a five gallon bucket
and then there's a lid type device that
[SPEAKER_04]: goes on top of the bucket, but it's got a
little mesh basket cut out of the center
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You fill that area with hydro tongue clay
balls and then you put your clone that's
[SPEAKER_04]: in a rock wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just set it in there and then it'll
root and the roots will hang down inside
[SPEAKER_04]: of that five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside that five gallon bucket,
you put a sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of different types of
sprayers available.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell a circular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a circle sprayer that's got spray
jets that shoot straight up and it's kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of a mister type thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're misting the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essentially a long growth version of
the auto cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a real big easy cloner is
basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to mist those roots from the
bottom real heavily and you put nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: in the water and a lot of oxygen,
heavily oxygenated and nutrient water
[SPEAKER_04]: spraying from the bottom so that those
roots hang down into that and grow into
[SPEAKER_04]: that spring water because gravity makes
the roots want to go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think gravity does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they just want to go down
or if it's gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may just want to do it naturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water's spraying up onto there and
it's growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I put it on a timer so that it stops
every once in a while so the roots can
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of dry so that they don't rot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you just keep it cycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every 45 minutes, it shuts off for 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: That lets your water cool down so that the
pump doesn't overheat your water because
[SPEAKER_04]: the oxygen pump and the fucking moving it
pump is going to make that water hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people throw a chiller in there
to keep that water cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: If one piece of all that tech goes wrong,
your whole thing could die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, but the production is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant seems to really love it when
everything's humming but it's one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things where if you're setting it up the
one bucket version on the cheap,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the quality of the parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just require constant attention and
you have to understand that your plant's
[SPEAKER_03]: got a gun to its head and the hammer's
cocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: One piece fails and that trigger gets
pulled and you start over, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I read that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I read that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I used to call them all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mazar420, thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will talk more about this stuff on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked up at Mike and he was just blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was staring into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the rig's looking at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take some dabs on the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did already and I think I'm probably
still good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to dab the rest of what is on
this parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some pineapple jack from our
friends at Turbex.
[SPEAKER_04]: By Last Quarter Gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's probably a quarter gram but I'm
going to take this and then I think we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to wrap up the show after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, got anything poignant to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gearing up for November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you can do it online most
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you're registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you know what election issues
are coming up in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a minute to actually research them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a hell of an election.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the news is focused on the circus that
is the presidential race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just say day to day?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did and that's the local issue stuff of
the things that tend to really matter to
[SPEAKER_03]: most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a minute to figure out what those
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: The local issues are now set.
[SPEAKER_03]: County voters will be voting on one
marijuana question whether or not they
[SPEAKER_03]: want to ban the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: City voters will be voting on three
marijuana questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one, do you want to ban the rec
industry, yes or no?
[SPEAKER_03]: The second question, do you want to allow
recreational stores, yes or no?
[SPEAKER_03]: The third question, do you want to tax
those stores at four and a half percent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a confusing set of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of complicated reasons for all of
those three questions appearing in front
[SPEAKER_03]: of public city voters but you need to know
which questions which.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to know the wording so that you
don't accidentally vote the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important that you know that stuff
regardless of whether you live near me or
[SPEAKER_03]: not because whatever the issues are in
your area, they will impact you
[SPEAKER_03]: personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you know what's up and make sure
you vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you gone to your Facebook page,
your Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Law's
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook page and typed in guidance on
which way to vote since it is worded
[SPEAKER_04]: awkwardly?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already a beautiful infographic
that helps with that that the Pueblo Pope
[SPEAKER_03]: did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing some amazing cannabis
reporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Rodriguez?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Wheeler and I don't know the other
reporter's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa Wheeler and your colleague who are
helping us out in the cannabis fight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just doing solid honest reporting and
when that's done, it leans far to the pro
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis side because that's just the
reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be a good reporter and not end
up reporting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know the issues in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't take that much time and it's
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks get out and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike always knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always got the right thing to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening and you're in the
industry, you should think about some sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of show up with your I voted sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a dot dot dot dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome promotion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Owners, store managers, people that voted
get a something like a percentage off
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: A free pre-roll if you spend something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the dispenser.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free and celebrate your freedoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mike, thanks for coming and hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you got that little guy at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you want to go hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It it'll be good to get home, but I love
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to get over here and I love
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming on, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always good material.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always bring good content.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, the next episode I have planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't even know if I should talk
about Jesse coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse says he's going to come over
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike might go pick him up and make sure he
shows up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next podcast will either be myself
and Mike or Jesse and myself or myself,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know how it's going to go in
these parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may or may not be a podcast recorded
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may or may not be epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outdoor season, so you never know
what could go on right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hope to have Jesse on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you know you're invited back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after that, you guys, I will be
recording once again with the dabbing
[SPEAKER_04]: granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to have her back on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tentatively scheduled.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the intro about the gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're test running everything to make sure
that this goes smooth this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're 48 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening to this, things look
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it looks good so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's quit while we're ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I'm going to wrap up this part
of the show and I'll be back in just a
[SPEAKER_04]: jingle and I'll put a bow on this bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, everybody, I want to thank you
