[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 752 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great show lined up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the main topic,
let's do a few shout outs to a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind folks who continue to support the
show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick it off with a big Grow From
Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include that link in
the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
everyone watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off by sending a big shout
out to my friend who allegedly possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me or made some lemon Jeffrey
concentrates that has gotten me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like dodging shit that's not coming at
me over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit from that lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, if you made the lemon Jeffrey
concentrates that somehow landed in my rig
[SPEAKER_00]: a few minutes ago, that shit is effective,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that I'm doing a breeding project
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the greenhouse today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always amazed at the outdoor growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do go there, it looks like
they've grown astronomically since the
[SPEAKER_00]: last time I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow so fast outdoors compared to the
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double or triple as fast outdoors is what
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to report, but everything looks
good in the greenhouse breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned in future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk more about what plants I've
got going on out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we did put the Jack the Ripper
male outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we'll be dumping pollen
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing the teases about the
greenhouse and keeping you updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next order of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the DGC
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday, July 30th at a location just
outside of Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team I read genetics will be at the DGC
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cup is going to be a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a consumption friendly event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be there consuming cannabis,
making friends, shaking hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a small competition happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people have entered some
flowers into a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who attends is a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you attend the Dude Grows Cup,
the DGC Growers Cup, you get to be a judge
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flower competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a one and you get a lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to taste all of the entries and
you get to vote on what the best flower at
[SPEAKER_00]: the event is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come taste some good herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will also be a plethora of great
seed breeders vending their seeds at the
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do look forward to seeing you at the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tickets, deets and links, make sure
you do check out dudegrows.com for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the information on the DGC Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big tab right on the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've been rambling long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of emails stacked up here
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is a recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, somebody did ask me
if I think that the male plants or the
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants know about each other in the
other rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked if I notice a difference in the
female plants if I have a male in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other room or if I notice a difference in
the male plants if I have a female in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I've noticed visible differences,
but I didn't have any real scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Mark updated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said I have an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the update, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I watched a documentary called The
Magic Plant and it said the terpenes come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the sun and they are the sex hormones
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds plausible, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, take care and thank you for
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those terpenes do have a lot of purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terps put off a lot of aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you smell food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you smell candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you smell flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you smell a pretty lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you smell a pretty dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, that smells nice, I want some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the cannabis plants are doing the
same thing to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that lady plant is over there going,
limonene, limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that male plant's going, I need some
limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly what they're saying
because we can't speak their plant
[SPEAKER_00]: language, but it sounds like you're onto
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those terps act like pheromones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the plants have pheromones that we
haven't, that I haven't learned about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does make good sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those terps are doing a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make me want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they're making the plants want to
mate with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can smell the terps in the other
room, that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does make good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude Mark, thank you for the great
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any updates,
of course the email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy, reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love generating, I love creating
listener-generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pre-reading this next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this next message comes from a
good friend and a Patreon supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend, girls grow
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when is it too late to save a
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very, very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is it too late to save a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you give up?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you try to fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that boundary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that borderline where you say
fuck it and throw in the towel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard do you actually try on a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also is it one plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it several plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more to the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if the plant is very sick,
is there a way, a product, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would save it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say new lockout or over hot or
stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on how bad the plant
is, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on how bad I need the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it depends on how far along the
plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it depends on is it the personal
grow or the commercial growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it life or death or is it a breeding
project that's kind of just for fun?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the honor, the privilege,
the blessing to be able to, if I'm growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a crop and I'm not happy with the way it
looks, I can scrap it and it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to ruin me financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked in a previous episode about a
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were to scrap one grow too far in,
then that could ruin them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could ruin the commercial grow,
which would fire everybody in that
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just recapping that fire a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow, maybe hypothetically
somebody's got one light and that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be maybe a pound of herb,
maybe two pounds, maybe it's just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I start making decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I really need this crop or do I really
need this crop or would it be less of a
[SPEAKER_00]: headache just to cut this shit down and
start over again?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of determining factors in
my strategies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, I don't cut enough
clones and have enough plants to have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of a backup strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a tight schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a tight plant count, so I'm going
to do a lot to try to save every single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that I can in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in a commercial grow, my panic
button is much shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: My panic fuse is much shorter than it
would be in a private grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my home grow, like I said, I can lose a
personal crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might not get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike might not get some weed for a couple
of weeks, but we could lose a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to have to file any
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one needs to look for a new job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do kill a crop at this rate,
I may need to look for a new job by then,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nobody's going to get fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too crazy is going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, I can't let it get
that bad before I start taking drastic
[SPEAKER_00]: measures to correct things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, in a commercial grow,
I've got all the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got anything I could imagine to help me
figure out what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got a really good network of
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think I'm like the wizard of Oz of
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, when you guys ask me grow
questions, I've just got a team of friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know that I can say, hey,
bro, why this or why this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to admit that I am not the
light guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to lumens and frequencies
and all that stuff, my brain simply does
[SPEAKER_00]: not care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to learn about lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain and my ADD does not want to learn
about lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to outdoor growing,
I simply don't do a lot of outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rock a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be my second year growing in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you ask me greenhouse growing
questions, I call Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you ask me outdoor growing
questions, I call Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, hey, bro, somebody asked me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I parrot that shit back to you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, I've got a big team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got people that I can call.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other consultants that I work
with that they call me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, bro, I've got this
weird fucking thing going on in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take a look and I'll go,
oh, it's because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just do each other favors,
just call each other back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my panic button, what I'm getting at is
I've got a lot more resources in the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will do a lot more in the commercial
grow to keep those plants alive,
[SPEAKER_00]: to rescue them, to save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't let them get too far fucked up
before I really start taking drastic
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the personal grow, I might go,
ah, there's some yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might want to up the nitrogen the next
time I feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see yellowing in the commercial grow,
I'm going to tell everybody, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time we feed up the nitrogen,
pay a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a meeting about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shit to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making sure that that nitrogen gets
added the next time we might foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't let it get too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the commercial grows, we're running
cocoa with perlite, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the minute you feed, you're going to
start seeing reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not necessarily the minute,
but I mean, you're going to see some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hydro, it can go really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a commercial grow, I really,
it's, I try really hard not to let them
[SPEAKER_00]: get to that panic mode, but I will try to
pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a pretty bad mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I talk about,
one of my goals, one of the things I pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: my self as is I'm able to help get rid of
bugs and problems and turn a problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: grow around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been hired to take over grows that
were infested with spider mites grows that
[SPEAKER_00]: were infested with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I almost have more fun turning a grow
around than walking into a grow that's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing well and just keeping it going or
making it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a good fucking it sounds maybe it's
because I've been grown for so long and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more of a it's more fun to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a nice challenging grow a grow
that's got spider mites and powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: and got nine bad employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great grow for me to walk into
because I can cure spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can cure powdery mildew and I can get
rid of nine bad employees and get five bad
[SPEAKER_00]: ass people to rock that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like fixing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I like being in the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't throw shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give up my there's a, it sounds
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've grown so much weed that it's
like, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can turn rooms and cut down a crop and
have that room running tomorrow and flower
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't never miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just 12 hours of a day in that room with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's more fun for me to try to go
into those rooms that are problematic and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of start in the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's more fun to dig myself
out of a hole and then try to fix that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then give myself so many crops to have
this goal by five crops out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be kicking up this much product and
we'll get this much THC percentage and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get this much concentrate percentage
and we'll get this much customer
[SPEAKER_00]: retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to work on those sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I almost have fun pulling myself out of
the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is just having, knowing if
you've got the resources, can you repair
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that you've got the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you invest the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it going to be how far back is that
problem gonna set you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gonna set you two weeks back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be easier just to cut new clones,
get them going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that is easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said newt lock, nutrient lockout,
depending on when, if it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's usually gonna happen right as you
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That usually happens when you go from veg
into the flowering stage, your transition
[SPEAKER_00]: phase is gonna suck, but your stretch
phase is gonna suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are gonna look like shit,
but you haven't started getting bud set
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a newt lockout and you've
still got like six weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You figured it out at like day 10 of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started showing signs by 14,
you're ready to make corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix up a solid batch of nutrients
that you know is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good base nutrient, some good microbes
in there, put your calcium, your
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, your phosphorus, potassium,
molybdenum, get all the good shit that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the basics of perfectly balanced meal,
perfectly pHed at the perfect DC and then
[SPEAKER_00]: feed that to those plants on that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I would start correcting it
from that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got six or seven more weeks to
go before that plant's even done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna transition out of that shit
phase where it's looking like it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna get a bunch of new
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna get bud set and you're
gonna get buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't even started developing buds
yet to do any damage to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not just keep pushing on through?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that newt lock happens later on,
when you start adding the bloom boosters,
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point, you're fucking six weeks
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push on through and finish the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're like four or five weeks past,
a lot of people might just cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're four or five weeks into
flower, a lot of people may consider
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it down if they've got spider
mites or a nutrient lockout, but you're so
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just push through it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get the outcome that you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get the product that you
wanted, the weight, the yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: the potency, the flavor, the dank photos,
but you're gonna get a learning
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push on through and have something to show
for your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in flower, keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never wanna just give up and cut
my losses if I've made it all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done veg work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of work to get up to that
phase, so I always try to fix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying I really enjoy trying to fix
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to grow herb for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not try to fix these problems and pull
my way out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got newt lock, I would try to
fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only gonna set you back two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were gonna pull a pound,
maybe you're only gonna pull 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, 12 ounces now, you're still gonna have
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some is better than none.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next example was over hot and stunted
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over hot, let's talk about too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you change the temperature,
they'll start growing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be tall and skinny and lanky
and kinda pissed off, but as soon as you
[SPEAKER_00]: correct the temperature, they'll start
growing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you meant over hot by too much
food, which depending on how bad you
[SPEAKER_00]: roasted them, you may be able to recover
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them a normal diet, dial back the
nutrients, they may recover from that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look super pissed off,
if you're embarrassed about it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanna start over, sometimes you just
have that feeling inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like fuck these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel fuck these plants,
then just cut them down and start over
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're never going to give them
the love and care that they deserve
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've already got that fuck these
plants feeling in your heart and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might try to convince yourself that
you're gonna take care of them and pull
[SPEAKER_00]: them through, but once your heart and your
brain decide, man, fuck these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants heard you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants felt you say that and so that
is the point when I would just kinda cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them down, give up at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never lost a commercial crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never cut down an entire commercial
crop and given up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had commercial crops that were not up
to the standards that I would like them to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely did not get posted to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no pictures, but I've never cut
down an entire crop in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and given up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cut down crops in my private grow
because we discovered that the whole back
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, excuse me, I did cut down an
entire crop in my private grow one time
[SPEAKER_00]: because Mike and I discovered that the
back corner, it was winter time and this
[SPEAKER_00]: one back corner at the exterior part of
the house, that whole corner, I said whole
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, excuse me for that, that entire
corner got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some big beefy plants back
there, but we noticed the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: along the back wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds were late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't experienced and knowledgeable as
knowledgeable as I am now to know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: have done about it, so we just went and
cut down all those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that they weren't healthy,
they weren't safe, they weren't any good,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I just cut all those down because there
was so much powdery mildew that treating
[SPEAKER_00]: them, spraying them, cleaning them up
still would not have made me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have felt gross about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing for medical cannabis
patients and I really thought about a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about my friend Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about what if I give Doug or
Mike some herb that's covered in powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and we smoke it and one of us or
all three of us gets sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna feel like a shithead.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job, my goal as a cannabis grower,
as a caregiver is to make people feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better and heal them, not to give them a
lung infection or a sinus problem or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the fuck else that powdery mildew
could have caused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did cut down, I think I cut down 90%
of that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we saved a few of the plants that
were up in the front, but I do remember
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting down all the shit in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were white rhino plants with buds
the size of footballs and we were really
[SPEAKER_00]: sad to cut that shit down, but sometimes
you got to cut your losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 90% of the time I would push on
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that our friend Girls Grow 2 has
military experience and you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling of like, I said the example,
being in the weeds and fucking pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got that rewarding feeling
inside of you of that accomplishment
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've got that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit feels good when you're like,
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at week 10, you cut some shit
down and you've got usable, smokable,
[SPEAKER_00]: tangible, enjoyable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be cannabis cup winning herb,
it may not be trophy weed, but you got
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without a struggle, maybe it wasn't as
enjoyable and you had to learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's better to learn how to fight
spider mites now than it is way later on
[SPEAKER_00]: when you think you've got, when your grow
is flowing, when it's humming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got more expensive genetics,
you got more expensive lights and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: get mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's good now to find that sort of
shit out when you're beginning or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're newer and then you can learn
how to fight that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when is it too late to save a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got webs on it, it might be time
just to go, if it's got spider mite webs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be time just to cut that shit
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got powdery mildew, it might be
time to cut that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the other things we can usually
get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know how to get rid of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know how to get rid of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that feeling inside of, ah,
fuck, I want to give up to remind you of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how did I get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a good thing to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I get to this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant is sick enough or new locked
out or over hot or stunted or has bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew badly enough to where you're
thinking, I might want to cut this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of that as like, how did I get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, was it neglect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it laziness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it ignorance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it miseducation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it lack of communication with the
team?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got somebody else helping you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it lack of communication with a
partner?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did we get powdery mildew and spider
mites to the level where I've got to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down all of these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then see how you can prevent that from
happening in future grows because we
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely don't want to deal with the
problem twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get that fuck these plants
feeling, that is basically the only time
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would really cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I've had that like,
not fuck these plants, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: with these plants, you know, it's
borderline and I've pulled those crops
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those did survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every crop has been beautiful,
but I've had some that have made me want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grab my dreads and just start yanking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when is it too late to save a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really up to your level of
patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: How badly do you want to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: How bad do you need the medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in veg and you can tell like two
or three weeks in that that shit just
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to work, go ahead and cut it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about last winter or two
winters ago, the pandemic really fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: my scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what year it is and how
long it's been anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it was Tuesday for two years,
so I'm kind of fucked up on timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point in life, I decided to
switch from HPS, high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, to LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did, the plants looked like
total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, a few weeks into flower,
I just went in and cut them all the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: down and started over because they were
not going to do anything good from what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was seeing from those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing good was going to come out of that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to have a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to have a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to have tall shitty plants
that were getting burnt by the light that
[SPEAKER_00]: were never going to meet my goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like week three, I just said fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cut every single one of those plants
down about 25 days into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped them all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mike was really heartbroken over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it was like I can do better
than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was I learned how to grow
under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some adjustments and I pulled
through and I did it better the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is two crops, I guess,
that I've cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powdery mildew crop and the failed LED
crop are crops that I cut down just
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wasn't happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How bad do you need the herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: How frustrated are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you want to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an opportunity to get more
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a backup plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I may keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, girls grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I rambled on and on about that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some useful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your level of frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will you accept?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you take it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, girls grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you once again for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got time for one more quick email
before we wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this one came from my buddy,
J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, J.H.?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do send me a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that I don't answer all of
them, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send, J.H., I get more messages from
you than I do all day long from everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when you wonder why I don't
answer every one of them, nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: personal, but just send a lot of them,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them coming because you do send a lot
of great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do pull some great messages out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some gold and all that mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I'm just picking on you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing but love for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, longtime
listener, first time caller here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when you're growing a small crop
in a four by four tent or maybe a five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five tent, what size pots do you go with?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good, really universal,
really common question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, would reducing my pot size from a
three gallon to a two gallon pot help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce stretch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use fabric or plastic pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one superior to the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great line of questioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you, J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm growing a small crop in a four by
four or a five by five, what size pots do
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with?
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am running new plants and just
running new shit and trying to take some
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and see what we just made,
I may do one or two gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I may do beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may do a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, we are limited to plant counts
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow, that's going to be way
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll touch on that as the theories and
the ideas of this progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, in a commercial grow,
I can run as many plants as I want in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a home grow, follow the legal
limits, follow the rules there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite often what determines how
many plants I put where is legal limits
[SPEAKER_00]: and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to do a four by four and I was
to put a bunch of beer cups in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may consider putting a hundred beer cups
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put like 10 rows of 10 and just
space them out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm limited to plant counts,
so I wouldn't do that here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll segue into what I would do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you would do a bunch of one gallon
pots and you could probably fit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess you could probably fit
10 or 12 of those in a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just taking up some of that cup
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's only eight of those,
but I would do maybe that 64 one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That crams them in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're only vegging to about 10 or 12
inches tall and then flowering and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, just getting in and getting out
really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you would do like 16 one gallon
pots and just have them in there real
[SPEAKER_00]: tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could do 25 one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how tight that would fit in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't visualize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could see five one gallon pots
across that five by five or four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got 25 of them in there,
but a more practical application that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would run in a tent and a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could do nine, 12, maybe 15,
maybe 16 three gallon pots depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly you want to pack them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to veg for a short time,
put more pots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to veg for a long time,
put less pots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I frequently do is nine
three gallon pots in a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works beautifully for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives the plants enough space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let me grow them up to about my knee
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finish at just the right height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nine three gallon pots is quite often a
very good, very successful growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're more limited on plant count,
four seven gallon pots is beautiful in a
[SPEAKER_00]: five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do four seven gallon pots in a
trellis net and pull them all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to run a perpetual grow in
a five by five environment, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: four seven gallon pots and you put one in
every two weeks and take one out every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got one that's in there at two
weeks, one that's in there at four weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's in there at six, one that's in
there at eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully you got a cultivar that
finishes right at eight weeks and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just rotate every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a plant out, harvest it,
put a new plant in there and put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four seven gallon pots work beautifully in
that five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably what I would do running a
small crop in a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably looking at like a whole
bunch of one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing you could probably do like 10
of them across.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one gallon pots are little.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I'm thinking about, you could
probably fit 10 across.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a hundred of those if you
really wanted to cram them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some space, maybe do 64 and
then start working up to three gallon pots
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're doing like maybe 12,
maybe 16, maybe nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how big the plants and
how much space you want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are bigger, you need more
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if the plants are smaller,
you don't need as much space for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does segue me into the next part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would reducing my pot size from three
gallon to two gallon help reduce stretch?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I believe it would do kind of the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the plants they know how
wide their pot is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that the plants
generally, unless you do some
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulating, they don't branch out much
wider than the size of your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get keep your plant in a two gallon
pot, that's only what's this eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I'm going to say that's 10 inches
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep your plant in a 10 inch around
pot, the root base only gets 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up that plant, it only spread
out about 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those bottom branches where I got
real far, maybe they went 14, 18 inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much further than that 10 inch base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you put that plant in a wider pot,
you'll notice it will widen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because it knows it's like,
I don't know, it's sort of a gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it just knows that if I get,
I can't get too wide because my feet
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't big enough to hold me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why I wear size 13 shoes,
need that bigger pot for that bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my theory and my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get wider when you put them in a
wider pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll stretch up more if you put them
in a skinnier pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're probably going to put them
closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get all close together like
that, they don't like to grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody recently asked me why plants
would get angry if I put them too close
[SPEAKER_00]: together, why they would get stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't grow out the way that they want
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get stretchy, trying to get to the
light because the light's not penetrating
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're so close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to grow out, but they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just grow up to fight for the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use fabric pots or plastic pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I use three
gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 70% cocoa and 30% perlite with two
drip emitters per pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each drip emitter comes from a different
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can feed two different feeds during
the day if I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of different controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can mix up a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reservoir A will have one feed and Res B
will have another feed so that I can feed
[SPEAKER_00]: one part throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right before they go to bed,
I can feed them with another thing if I so
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can just run clean water through one
if we decide to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the commercial environment,
three gallon fabric pots, 70% cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% perlite, two drip emitters running
from two different reservoirs so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed two different nutrient solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I switch it up all the fucking time,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently using the tall five gallon
plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the Pandy, shit was hard to get and
those were what was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I grabbed from my local
grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very versatile, very flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can work with what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have some shit, but those were
the pots that were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I grabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one superior to the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's all about your goal, all about
your intent, all about your purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I don't like about the
fabric pots is if you don't get them full
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't pack them upright, the water
will kind of run out of the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I like that you can't overwater
them because the water will run out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pros and cons there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend J.H., I think I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot more from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't get offended that I am not
answering your, is that a deluge of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I got nothing but love and respect
