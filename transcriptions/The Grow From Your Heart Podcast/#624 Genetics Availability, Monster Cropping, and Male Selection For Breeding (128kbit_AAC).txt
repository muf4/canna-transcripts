Three, two, one, go!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 624 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to answer a
couple of Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few
shout-outs to a few members of the 710
[SPEAKER_00]: Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who
support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[SPEAKER_00]: level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's start off
with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you shout-out to my new friend,
Spank Your Blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a big thank you
shout-out to Andy D and Mike F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout-out to JT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout-out to
That Guy Smokin' and Godfather Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to Jackie

Brian P. And then let's wrap it up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank
you shout-out to my good friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off the show by saying
thank you for all of the birthday love and
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode was the birthday episode
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is now seven years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of feedback, a lot of great
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of birthday shout-outs, a lot of
YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to follow that up with a big
thank you for all of the love and support
[SPEAKER_00]: and contributions from my friend,
Stoney Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of episodes ago, I talked about
losing our friend, Stoney, to a drunk
[SPEAKER_00]: driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've moved on quite a bit from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all getting back to the normal
routines of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I owe you guys a big thank you for all
the virtual hugs, the digital hugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the virtual love and support, the words of
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff does help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you to everybody who reached
out for contributions for Stoney's wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've raised a little bit of funding for
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try to include the link in the
YouTube video description, but they took
[SPEAKER_00]: down the video because of the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to repost that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, you can't post GoFundMe and
fundraising links and video descriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do that, but I will find other
avenues of posting those GoFundMe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on my Cannabuzz, my Instagram,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find a link to help out our friend,
Stoney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you to everybody who
reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've contributed financially,
if you contributed with just words of
[SPEAKER_00]: kindness, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff does mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this community means a lot to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Iry Army, the Grow From Your Heart
podcast crew, just this weed community
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have created, the DGC,
the Dude Grows crew, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it, the 420 gang, the 710 crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis community is fucking
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be able to live the way I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be who I am without this
community that we have built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels great to be noticed in that
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to put myself as a leader
in the community or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying now, but to be noticed,
to be a noted figure in the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community feels good to have this army
behind me, this team of support,
[SPEAKER_00]: this bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute to the entire Cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always got each other's backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bad apples in every group,
but most of the time, this community has
[SPEAKER_00]: got each other's back and it's fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to send a special shout out to
my good friend, Tree Star Meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree Star knows why I'm sending them a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect, big support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to the main topics of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That music ended at just the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to jump into some Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can support the show on
Patreon at patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend, caribou
heart genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and I'm curious, a caribou heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the heart of a caribou?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you eating caribou heart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I'm high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I hope all is well with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are great, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just have a quick genetics
availability question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every time I check seeds
here now for your strains, they are sold
[SPEAKER_00]: out or at least a couple of the strains
I'm looking for are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thought of ordering them a pack at a
time as they're available, but I'm up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and I'm trying to avoid those extra
charges for shipping over the border
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that will add up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just know, just a disclaimer,
those shipping charges, that's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not seeds here now doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the postal service that charges
you so much to get packages to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just costs a lot to ship over the
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you send, it costs a lot of
money to ship it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing we can do about that
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand your dilemma of not
wanting to ship a bunch of times over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about 30 bucks, maybe 36
bucks just to send a pack of seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That adds up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's half of a pack of seeds at that
rate or one pack if you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: under 25 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I would much prefer doing one big
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'll get to the point now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm particularly looking for the morning
dew, lemon, Jeffrey, golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and orange guys, some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be restocked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in which case I'll be patient until
they're back, or are any of them going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be discontinued?
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore I should start searching through
other vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great things to talk
about really quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, none of those strains, the morning
dew, lemon, Jeffrey, golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and orange gasm are going to be
discontinued forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, um, the golden goat is sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a moment, lemon, Jeffrey is getting
low and golden goat is not far behind in
[SPEAKER_00]: that trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in the next production run,
but I don't know that I'll get to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more before I run completely out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you'll have to be patient with me
there or try to get them quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others, the morning dew, the morning
dew will be around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a staple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will stick around for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's touch on this Canadian shipping
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the seed vendors order seeds,
they get them in a bulk order.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put them up on the websites and they
sell out quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't control how quickly they sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that they sell quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want is, uh, vendors as
seed sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our seeds to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I honestly send them, they request
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them, they put them on the website
and then they sell usually within a day or
[SPEAKER_00]: two of going up on the websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go out quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things you can do, you can sign up for
those websites, mailing lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they put new things in stock,
they will let you know, Hey, these
[SPEAKER_00]: products are back in stock, or you can
email the vendor directly and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I see that you've got this one and
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also waiting for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you build me an order?
[SPEAKER_00]: They may put together a pre-order for you
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the third item comes in, you may be
able to get that item.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may request you to pay for all three
of them at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the third one comes, you get the
first one that shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll ship it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot guarantee you that any of the
vendors do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to contact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're all ran by people and most of
them are ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the vendors I work with are really
cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll work with you and do what you need
done because we like to make sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to accommodate our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, those strains are going to be
restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now there are probably restocked
by the time I'm recording, by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: this comes out, there could be sold out
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the other things you can do is
to get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can sign up for the, the mailing
list for the specific vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you when they get the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email the vendors and ask to
arrange a bulk order or you can sign up on
[SPEAKER_00]: my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a newsletter site where I try not
to bombard you with too many updates and
[SPEAKER_00]: messages, but about once or twice a month,
I will say, Hey, I just sent an update to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds here now.com, or I just sent a
restock to El Fuego seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys can be the first to grab
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a hint if you're signed up on
the newsletter, but they go very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I don't even know there's a
two or three, three to five day,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe window of when the seeds leave my
possession to when they're received by the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't know when they list them
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't email me and say, Hey,
we put them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even get a notification sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, be diligent, keep looking,
sign up for all the notifications that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, and then just click on that site,
click refresh quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what it's like trying to get
things on the internet nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that, but I'm excited that
they're selling that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me make sure I'm covering all the
details in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you check seeds or now they're
sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they sell quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the shipping dilemma in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not, uh, I can't do anything about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad they make it to you because
sometimes the packages get taken going to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nothing will be discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some things will be temporarily
sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to act now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, discontinued, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other vendors, other vendors are
always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, seeds here now is the preferred
preferred vendor, but there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, check my website for a full list of
vendors on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have hype seed bank and El Fuego
seeds listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in talks with one or two others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get them on there very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is more of a grow related
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend, uh, Caribou heart genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message and thank
you for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm also working on other avenues of
getting seeds to Canada safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll work on that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for a Canadian update.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move forward onto these
Patreon questions because this could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: long episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this one came from, do they want
their names said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their names
said, so I'm going to keep them safe and
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, good morning, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to tell you that I listened
to most of the cannabis podcasts from news
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing, and you do the best job at
explaining things and terms in which we
[SPEAKER_00]: can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like how you mostly stick to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, that is a great way to start an
email to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do the best job at explaining
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like I reiterate things
and say things too many ways, too many
[SPEAKER_00]: times, but that's how people learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people learn visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people learn from repetition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people learn from hands-on
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really bored in school because I
felt like the teacher was droning on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try not to, I try to be creative in
my teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to paint a good, solid picture of
what I'm painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I try to think that maybe you have no
idea what I'm talking about from the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to be able to get it from
what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find I've got a responsibility in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm getting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you like how I mostly stick to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, it's a cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, uh, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do, uh, sometimes I fuck up
and put some political stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I talk about comedy and
whatever a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you're listening and thank
you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stick to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life has other aspects going on,
which I do ramble about occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, during COVID it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's been different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I started breeding in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I rented a room in Denver in this
crazy lady's basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We named our, one of our first cultivars,
alien struggle bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a good strain name,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sour alien to wild tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, anyway, we have since
moved a little closer to home in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a long move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made that safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been working with the F1
alien struggle bus and on the 11th
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, I found a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got ASB F1 number 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says after listening to the episode
today, about sub, uh, keeping sub cool
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured why not ask you if it would be
cool if I created a cross with the alien
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle bus number 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, which of your available packs
do you think would go best with the
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage of the alien struggle bus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll recap that sour alien to the
wild tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the phenotype is more indica
dominant in structure for bud and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is hard for me to say what I think
would make her better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how you feel about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, you can't even fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't add anything to it to make it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit it says, I feel like I'm rambling,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gist of this, you have a great
weekend too, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably be hearing this on a
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so have a great week and a great
weekend and enjoy your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a good breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend has an alien struggle bus,
uh, F1, and they have selected a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they've got a male, let's see across,
I know they've got a female, they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the number 11 and they want to find a good
male from my lineup to cross this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to recap, the alien struggle bus
is that sour alien.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see probably sour diesel alien OG to
a wild tie, which is probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I got some chocolate flavors and some
fun going on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the alien struggle bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more indica dominant in structure and
plant type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can understand why you'd want to
breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want a male plant to breed to from
my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding selection is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to get from this cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is your plant mildew resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pathogen resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pest resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, does it handle, uh, temperature
swings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it handle drought conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it handle overwatering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it handle underlight overlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle shade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle, uh, if the LEDs are too
close and too bright, does it freak out
[SPEAKER_00]: from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it take overfeed underfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it handle grower stresses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what is this plant lacking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find what it's lacking and then
find a male plant that can improve upon
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without seeing, this is like setting up
two people on a blind date and not knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of, I've got a very minimal
description about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my date partners, uh, it's short
and squatty and kind of indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives me a lot of room that would
breed well, honestly, to everything in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lineup, because it's quite opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my lineup is, uh, skinnier leaf
sativa type drug varieties that have lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of turps and get you a nice head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is this indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably more of a mellow cerebral
sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of my stuff is going to work
well to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male contributes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the male is going to contribute a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, to pest resistance,
to mold and mildew resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: to just stress resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is going to come from your
male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you want that fee, that new
offspring?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want it to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What traits do you want to carry on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you asked specifically what
plants you would breed with from my
[SPEAKER_00]: lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about,
um, strains in my lineup and what I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they would do if you bred to this alien
struggle bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to add potency,
um, I know that a rise is one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: potent lines in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a rise test really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 35.84% THCA test in a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could find a male like my Solomon
that passes that THCA trade along,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be a beautiful breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would almost be making, uh,
maybe a better arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a rise to a strong Indica,
which may bring out some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe in a rise to your Indica dominant
cross, that would increase potency and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a really cool cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want more potency,
maybe the double dose, something about
[SPEAKER_00]: that dosy dough to the arise made some
serious potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that on your Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make chocolatey short
squatty super potent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be covered in frost is what I would
predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor palette will be off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you want to make more potency,
maybe the blue raspberry truffle,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one is known for making a lot of
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get Leonardo and reverse the
Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be beautiful as well for
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed a lot for a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a concentrate kind of sewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I were going to be breeding for a
flavor, I would go for the blue raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: truffle as the male and find one that has
a really sweet stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he rubbed the stem in the,
in the veg and in the flower phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should have a sweet, almost a,
a cereal milk sort of a smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's the kind of aroma and flavor
I'd look for, for a male in the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go for the strawberry
starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will give you some great flavors
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, uh, there's a, like a throw up and
strawberry milk sort of flavor from the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would give you a really nice breeding
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sun kiss would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a sun kiss plant that smells like
vomit and orange rinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a beautiful male to add
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, orange Gazm would be a beautiful
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can reverse the orange Gazm,
create some orange Gazm pollen and put
[SPEAKER_00]: that on your male, on your female plant,
you would make grapefruit, sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: funky, orange, tremendous, crazy,
crazy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some flavor and potency
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you want to add weight for good
weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course Arise puts out big fat,
heavy weighted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle is a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to pay the bills, that's one
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll put out fat weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also I assume, and I'm pretty sure that
if you got a good male with good
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, a good shape, you could really
pack on the weight from a blue raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a good strawberry starburst
male that grows with a nice stout
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, big fat male cola buds,
that one's going to give you nice
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring with big fat giant harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like kind of with my little
chart that I've made here, Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst, and blue raspberry
truffle would guaranteed be good breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: male selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going because I do have
a couple more criteria that work well for
[SPEAKER_00]: male selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to contribute to the mold and
pest resistance, two of the plants I would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider breeding with from my line would
be the prana and the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is very mold, mildew, and pest
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the turps and the aroma of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get powdery mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get boitritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be mites in a lot of the room,
and the prana plants, the plants that the
[SPEAKER_00]: prana was bred from, the flow,
for some reason, just doesn't get spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the subsequent offspring carry
that trait, that weird musty, insensy,
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty foot turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites just don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could breed to the prana,
and that would definitely help out with
[SPEAKER_00]: your mold and pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew has proven in many climates,
many conditions, many environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: many places, that it is very mildew
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the morning dew in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it in Maine, in the wetness in
Maine, and it will finish, and it will not
[SPEAKER_00]: get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it finish in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it finish outdoors in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it finished outdoors in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work well everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the morning dew is a good one to help
you increase mildew and mold and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to plant, if you've got a
plant that is prone to getting problems
[SPEAKER_00]: like bugs and mildew, breed it to either
the prana or the morning dew, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring may, just maybe, won't be as
prone to the problems you're seeing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: original female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something we all want to do is reduce
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want these plants to speed up a
little bit more quickly in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I would find an early
finishing prana male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some male plants in the
prana line that start spitting out pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sacks really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that build up big fat male
colas really early and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've let some of them go for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got as many seeds as I do and
you're looking for males like I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you let shit flower for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've posted pictures of breeding male
rooms with like 10 and 12 male plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and they're just all fully blowing
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for me to do my male phenotype
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen prana males make big giant
colas with lots of pollen early on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which tells me the offspring from those
will flower quickly and finish quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to speed up your flowering
time, prana may be the little girl that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think the one that we
selected, just by my little flow chart
[SPEAKER_00]: here, unless you've got problems,
unless you want to add to the pest
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, unless you want to add,
reduce the flowering time, I think Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst, and Blue Raspberry
Truffle are going to be your three
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that strawberry flavor,
use the strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can make Strawberry Struggle Bus,
and that sounds fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make Blueberry Struggle
Bus, you do the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make, I don't know,
what would you call it to Arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be the Arise Struggle Bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be the Space Bus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make that one to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are three solid recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to fuck around and make some
feminized seeds, I would cross it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need to fix something,
if you've got problems, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when I would go to the morning dew
or the prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're focused straight up on potency,
maybe double dose and Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a lot of info, a lot of
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had your notebook out,
because I spilled a lot of beans on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you want your name said,
but shout out, and I hope your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, once you've done that, send me a
couple seeds, bro, and I'll grow them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll breed them back to something of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll send them back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll just keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll just keep breeding all
kinds of crazy shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a whole bunch of cool new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another Patreon question in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about this person quite a bit on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Arise genetics are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of time into selecting my
Arise mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Arise mail has been a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing the hard work
into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says now that I have identified the
lady, I will be taking several flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: clones to revege and enjoy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend grew some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They identified that one of these plants
is a female and it's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have cut some clones from the
plant that is in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the question comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you dispel my myth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things to do is to
dispel cannabis myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's myth goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taking of flowering clones and
supercropping reduces THC potency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring each time it is performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the proposed myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend here, who goes by,
I'm going to say Alabama Man is who this
[SPEAKER_00]: is from, just because I keep seeing it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Alabama Man is asking if taking
clones from flowering plants will reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC and potency of the offspring each
time it is performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a qualified scientist to give you
a real solid scientific science book
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let me say that straight off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm about to give you is 100% bro
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all from what I know from doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've experienced this, but I don't wear a
lab coat and I didn't take enough notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take what I'm saying with a grain of
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any problem with those super
crop clones if they are taken early
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are given enough time to
recover and be in a complete vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage before you put them back into the
flowering stage, let them re-veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them get back into a complete
vegetative stage, let them grow out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, all that weirdness, let them develop
an apical dominant top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you flower them again,
you will notice zero difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe there will be any loss in
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that for a bailout?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the clones are taken properly,
if the mother plant is healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the clones are taken properly and kept
healthy, I do not believe there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: any degradation or loss of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot like re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot like cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a hybrid combo of re-veg
cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a lot of people would do if
they don't have enough space to sex a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, if they don't have enough space to
run a bunch of plants and take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run your plants, you find that keeper
female, and you rip a couple of clones
[SPEAKER_00]: right before it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too late because then you may see
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: My disclaimer, you've got to have a
healthy mother plant, a healthy clone
[SPEAKER_00]: donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be too far into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to fully re-veg these
cuts before you start messing with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting them back into flower,
or then you will see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's done correctly, proper care,
proper moms, good clean technique,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything is done with a standard
operating procedure that is proven to
[SPEAKER_00]: work, I do not see any problems with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the clones, cut the clones,
put them under 24 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they're rooted, within that
like 14-day rooting period, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: already starting to revert to go back to
the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you pot them, get them under a bigger
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those roots take off, they're eager
to get back into a vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: start feeding them strong vegetative
nutrients, get them under the proper blue
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum lighting, get them under the
proper light schedule, and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: re-veg quite quickly depending on your
feed, the amount and size of light you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, those plants will be happy copies
of their moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, if it is done correctly,
you are not losing any quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not reducing THC potency of the
offspring each time it is performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically doing a hybrid combo of
re-vegging and super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you do it carefully,
it will work magically.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Alabama Man, get an easier name
to say, but thank you for all the great
[SPEAKER_00]: content, all the great messages,
all of the great Patreon interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We message back and forth quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do check Patreon not often enough,
but when I do check, there's always a
[SPEAKER_00]: message from my friend Alabama Man,
and I do look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he did send an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, correction to the above,
flowering clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that right on the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, how long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, you know what, let's just do this
next one because why not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's knocking on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ringing the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to this message right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Rasta Jeff, I wanted to
tell you, belated happy birthday,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I love the rants you go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love me a good rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in the right place because I've
been taking dabs lately, and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking some good shit, and I've been on
some good rants, so I'm glad you're
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of rants, I don't know if you
watch the Monday night Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: shows where all I do is rant for a solid
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: My account is irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite all of you that are watching now
to find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the Monday night live show every
Monday around seven 10 PM mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I log in and I take a few dabs and I hang
out with my friends and just chat about
[SPEAKER_00]: life, talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I end up on some super good
rants, so I invite you guys to come check
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what kind of rants I get started this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: My rants are inspired by the things you
type in the comments, so come join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody check it out Monday night around
seven 10 PM on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to save the videos, but sometimes
Instagram doesn't give me the option to
[SPEAKER_00]: save.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it pops up and says,
Do you want to save this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I click yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't pop up, I can't do it and
they disappear, so I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have taken down all of the other
videos I had saved as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know what's up Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But however, join me for the Instagram
live show Monday night, seven 10 PM
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hang out and rant about some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this message did come from our
friend girls grow to and it goes on to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, I also wanted to tell you totally not
cannabis related, but you've inspired me
[SPEAKER_00]: and given me some encouragement through
your work that I could finally pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger on starting my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not cannabis related, but I love
hearing that I have inspired and
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged other people to start a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are never too many podcasts in the
podcasting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did listen to your show briefly and it
sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are getting you ladies are
getting very comfortable on the microphone
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll only continue to get more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound will only get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sounds great and you're doing a
good job for especially for how early into
[SPEAKER_00]: the show you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I wanted for years and
I've wanted to do this for years now and
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow never felt quite good enough to do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your latest episode with your expression
of gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so fucking inspiring and hopeful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for still talking to the camera
and hopes to help someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt so many people keep keep it
kicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your legacy will be around in
the cannabis and the history of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: from girls grow to this is a great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not cannabis related,
but just knowing that I'm inspiring
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to start a new venture to jump
into a new project that they may be of
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidated by that they didn't feel like
they were going to do good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels good to hear that this little
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing it for seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we inspiring growers and
smokers and breeders, but we're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: new fucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to add a link to our friends new
show in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to take a look,
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you give it a quick listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them some words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not the show for you,
keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send any negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send any bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send any criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody needs that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys send some positivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send some words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage them to do more episodes because
it's a good show and it's going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic for your relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I was able to encourage you to
do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can provide any podcast help for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got it under
control, but if you want some tips or
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, equipment, production,
whatever I could do, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to help you out because
you've given me a tremendous gift that I
[SPEAKER_00]: see it's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it almost every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great gift from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never talked about that on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like that was appropriate
too much, but thank you for the gift here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what that is and I do appreciate it
and respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can do anything, you let me know.
