All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 763 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for the short hiatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did catch the plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super sick for about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost two weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't have all the air I feel like
I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm a little clogged up in my
chest, throat, nose, lung, region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear my ears sound funky in the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best to get back on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to recover my energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to catch up on other
chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another life also other than
just podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to keep up, catch up with
that while recovering from the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who has sent me
well wishes, words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have checked on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with all of your crazy and useful
advice on how to beat the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think rest and hydration were the main
factors that did help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was basically misery.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't just face down into a pillow
under the air conditioner, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't want to hear too much about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did feel like my blood was boiling and
my brain was cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that that part is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to apologize for missing the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a big turd for not being at
the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advertised for that for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally prepared for that for two
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got the plague and I could not even
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who traveled
from all over the world to come see me at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just come see me, but I know a lot of
people are looking forward to seeing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a big turd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people that traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people that made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to everybody that I told I
was going to go see Jamiri Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jamiri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could not make it to that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super sick that whole week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to give a big giant shout out to
my buddy White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike, if you're listening,
bro, high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: High five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not able to attend the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent Mike with all of the booth
equipment for the iRegenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He set up the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kicked ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He met the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold a gang of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a lot of friends, made a lot of
contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I got nothing but great feedback
about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody said, you were a great dude,
that you did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your help, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for going and running the
iRegenetics booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody else that I would trust and
rather do that booth for me other than
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one other person I've ever let
work a booth for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to you guys for helping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling on talking about
the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Hobbit Feet for
his victory at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to see iReArmy win the Dude
Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to turn this mic up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't put enough air into the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hobbit Feet, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also congrats to Justin and JR Token,
second and third place winners at the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all champions in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all three of you, great people,
great growers, great members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was proud to see your names and faces
pop up as the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like I'm going super
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run out of breath here and
run out of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be a quick podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to pop in, explain what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that I'm not gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's not gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get this train back on the rails
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to the Dude
Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude, Scotty, Guru, Banner,
everybody behind the scenes that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember to mention right now because I
still feel kind of like I'm fucking half
[SPEAKER_00]: brain dead and I didn't write enough
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to everybody from the Dude
Grows crew who put together Shelby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Shelby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, thank you for the putting the
event together and throwing a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I couldn't attend it,
Team Irie Genetics had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Irie Army had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were there in full force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the Irie Army came home
with the victory with Hobbit Feet bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: home the trophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to the Dude, Scotty,
Guru, Shelby, Banner, everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you throwing an event for
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for including me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra thanks for the phone calls that I
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day before and the day of the event,
people were calling like, what's up,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear you're sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are super disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks for the love, the
encouragement, the fist bumps,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also speaking of encouragement and love,
big shout out to Zara for taking great
[SPEAKER_00]: care of me while I was not feeling well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was laying on the couch face down into
the couch, just dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she made sure to give me a bunch of
juice and hydrate me and feed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was putting a cold washcloth on my
head and on my neck and on my feet and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, trying to save my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without her, I don't know how well that
would have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, babe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I wouldn't be here without Ms.
Dread Vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, Zara.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for rescuing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm still a little bit weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear it in my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear it coming through the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't sound good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to make you listen to a
long show where my voice sounds just not
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get the shows back on
schedule soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I'm going to put this one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the Thursday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may not be a Monday show unless I
can get this junk in my ears to not sound
[SPEAKER_00]: all goopy and weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to record more than I need to
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys deserve a better show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect better from myself and so do you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I really did enjoy seeing
was people said, hey, bro, you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a week off in like seven or eight
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a break and take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I haven't missed a show in seven
or eight years when the plague happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pandemic happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody kind of took a break and slowed
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubled my speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from an audio podcast to a video
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really stepped up to see business
because I was stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't go do my other jobs that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really focused in on this stuff and I
didn't take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people did get to slow down,
take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were forced to take a
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this sickness, this virus that I
caught was kind of a, it was a sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: force for me to slow down and take a break
to see what really needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What doesn't need to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What order of priority shit matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did kind of show me some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The priorities are still the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going away, but a good quality
show is very important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure to get these shows up
to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody who told me,
take a break, catch your breath,
[SPEAKER_00]: get your temperature down, hydrate,
take some zinc, take some fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recommended all kinds of vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a mailbox full of great supplements
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who helped take care of me,
encouraged me, checked on me, sent me
[SPEAKER_00]: love, energy, vibes, prayers, chocolate,
Grubhub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Door dash juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a lot better, but I'm still,
uh, it's been, uh, I want to say I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: virus free probably for four or five days
and I still feel kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, um, in the meantime,
when, while I'm working on recovering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I get better, I'll start
recording again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep the show going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, you guys go listen to
the older episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is seven 63, which means there are
700.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say there's probably 500 good
episodes out there that you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go listen to all that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch up while I'm not able to give you
new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do me the favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go listen to the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I did notice the podcast was
approaching 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully by the time I get well and get
ready to rock more episodes, we're at
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't leave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is what I'm saying just because I'm
sick, just because I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ditch us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get more subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it up to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited to see that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got punched in the face with the
plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, that's all I think I'm going to
ramble about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just going to be a quick 10 minute
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even shorter than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can ask for is, um, please do send
a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, send me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a stack here in front of me,
but they're going to burn out quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me a lot of grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send them to grow from your heart
at hotmail.com or go to my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com and there's a grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that, fill out the questionnaire,
send me your grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put those on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I build shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love building podcasts based on listener
generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the question, that means a
lot of other people out there probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can help a lot of people with one
podcast episode with one good email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to those old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to get my oxygen levels and energy
levels back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back on fire here in no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in and dabbing and back in
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the whole point of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks for the big box of gifts from
the dude grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of fun shit to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll talk more in depth about that
in a future episode when I got more air to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen, chukers, all of you beautiful grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart, cannabis enthusiasts out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all I've got for you for this
quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back as soon as I can to get the
show back up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to deliver you the quality content
that you deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hydrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all the juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could imagine all the hippie shit you
could dream of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is helping, but I feel like I got wiped
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is all I've got for you
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in some day pretty soon,
hopefully with fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to my buddy
Hobbit feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
I'll see you next time.
