Activist or even someone who's just
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about the current state of
cannabis this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you I'm your host rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me as always I

[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I got to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already getting a frog in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, sitting across the table from me,
you guys will have no, you'll be so
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who's here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what's up, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea how hard it is to get
this guy on a podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what it takes to pull
Jesse away from his life to come be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show for an hour and get him high out of
his mind and then send him home hungry as
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dude, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running some shit over at Hygro
indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else you got going on, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mechanic shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanic shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot rod shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy does a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn how to do, are you an
electrician?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask somebody if they're an
electrician and they go, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, no, they are not an electrician.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it doesn't need to be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the big question there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that Jesse is good
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the man at Hygro indoor growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is brought to you by my great
friends at Hygro indoor growing supplies.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all the information you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always start the show with a freaking
frog in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jesse is here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do a whole bunch of
technical formal introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all wanted Jesse to come on the show
and do another grow lesson for us because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that growing outdoor is almost
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people asked me kind of about doing a
budget episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they don't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured we'll work on getting the
basics of an outdoor grow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe if we have some extra time,
we will talk about maybe how to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: budget grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way people don't have to break the
bank to build their grow and grow a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we have some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and I have been at this for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet we could build a hoop house together
in probably two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, easily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's got the tools and I'll keep the
dad nail hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what we're going to talk about
may be kind of regional to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust a lot of what we
say for your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in California, you may be a
little bit earlier than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the East Coast, it's going to
be a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to teach you to grow
in the South or in the East where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot more humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scheduling is a lot more wonky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather comes Midwest is pretty
similar to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot easier for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get most of this stuff based on
Colorado grows, but we'll try to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody can work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first question we should
start with is where, where should we start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should we look at growing our
outdoor crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would be our ideal space?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a South facing, you know,
good Southern view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for, for the sun, um, starting this
one off all stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come at you eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can edit some stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, no need for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you want, you know, probably six hours
a day direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll grow on this, but you
know, for proper, you know, you want six
[SPEAKER_02]: plus, um, for big fat watch points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer like 10 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, but I mean, can make it work
outdoors is really forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, they'll grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow on accident sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a South facing, uh,
slope if you can, uh, what if we're stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we're in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to avoid some sheds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, street lights, if you can street
lights, most definitely sheds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you don't want to get too
blocked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that is mainly for airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if your areas, you know,
like in the middle of four sheds or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, I'll stack together,
but it's 20 by 20, you know, you got
[SPEAKER_02]: plenty of airflow there for a couple of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave some space for the plants to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's like a six by six spot,
you know, that's enough for one plant
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you guys, your outdoor plants are
going to get big if you do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in a few minutes
when we talk about container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need, you would like a Southern
facing slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're going to grow in your
backyard, backyard or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't grow between the garage and the
house and the shed unless you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of air, air flowing through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's too high and my throat's all
jacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, make sure you get plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want your plants touching each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do plan them, make sure you
give like, expect the plants to be six to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight feet around each by the time you're
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit bigger if you're a good
grower and you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, give yourself plenty of room is kind
of what I was headed toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might be behind on this question,
but, uh, here in Colorado, when should we
[SPEAKER_00]: put our plants outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, pretty much anywhere in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he could have been out a couple of
weeks ago, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, you know, the, the summer we've
had here locally, um, you could have been
[SPEAKER_02]: out at first of May easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask a really random question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, locally we've been getting beat to
shit with hail every, for two weeks we had
[SPEAKER_00]: hail every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does someone deal with torrential
hailstorms like that in a ganja store in a
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you get real good at seeing hail
storms coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the tarps up, you watch tarps
buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's with our in-ground plants,
uh, the hail storm that actually hit our
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we were able to put 55 gallon trash
buckets over each of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flip it upside down and give it a
little hut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if they were bigger further
in the season, we'll talk about a hoop
[SPEAKER_00]: house in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to interrupt you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, did the hoop house get fucked up from
that hail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it had a shade cloth on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, we'll talk about a hoop
house toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write that down because we talked
about it on a previous episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we should, uh, kind of re rewind on
that one when we can last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: it totally got fucked up by hell though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, you're going to fuck some
shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like shit's going to go wrong,
but you always get next year and you'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll, you'll salvage something out of
your harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You almost always get something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thieves are cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing that's going to take
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've got the word thieves and cops
written on a note later on in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we were on the same page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, so we've got a few plants in,
uh, ideally, ideally it would be on a
[SPEAKER_00]: field in Humboldt County or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or out in Rye on a south facing slope with
a big 18 foot tall chain link fence where
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody can get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that's not always going to happen
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're going to want these plants,
plenty of space between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about this
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of skipping ahead, but Jesse said
you can put them out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I thought about all the weather we've
been getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's, let's just go right to the hoop
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the ideal outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to go outdoors cheap,
uh, to protect everything, I think a hoop
[SPEAKER_02]: house might be, uh, yeah, that's also the
best way to get the best resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, production in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, out to just straight up outdoor tends
to get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're making concentrates,
you're going to make dust concentrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: beaten by the sun, um, uh, rained on,
you know, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A simple hoop house covering, um,
can save you a lot of headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can create a couple people too,
but, um, as long as it's tall enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, realize the stranger you're
growing, do a little research,
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out how much you're going to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you've done this before,
you know, if you'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so plan for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get big outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan, plan for the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and make sure you have plenty of
airflow at the top of the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_02]: at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fresh air in and old stale air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as important as in the grow and
the humid air too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because the plants are transpiring
and the plastic traps the water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you got to get that out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a real quickly, if you could
describe to me how to build a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just a hoop house that would fit
in my backyard, you know, maybe just like
[SPEAKER_00]: a 10 by 20 at the biggest would be the
most, the just, you know, two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes worth of how to build a hoop
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm trying to think how simple,
um, I mean, start with the frame,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take like, uh, what size did you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like a 10 by 20, 10 by 20,
uh, get to 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so you'll need 40 foot of lumber there
or 30 foot of lumber there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I forgot to carry the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, uh, so build your frame,
um, just like a big box, um, secure it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to secure it to the
ground, but it'll help around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, inside that frame,
just bend your, your PVC tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd use like probably 20 foot
tube or something like, or 20 foot stick
[SPEAKER_02]: on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, that's going to end you
up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somewhere around a seven foot
ceiling, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure on that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, and then just continue down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, this over 20 foot span,
you'd probably want, I'd recommend at
[SPEAKER_02]: least seven, um, probably go for more like
eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing, he's we've,
so you've got a rectangle, you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: rectangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10 by 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we're going to do,
why we call it a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a PVC tubing and it almost
looks like you're just using hula hoops
[SPEAKER_00]: and building a long tube, but you make an
arch from, and we're doing it the 10 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 foot side, not the 20 inch or the 20
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go from one 10, uh, you just make
an arch and that way it makes it about
[SPEAKER_00]: seven feet tall and then it's 10 feet
wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do those about every two or
three, three or four feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how much wind, um,
I, I, you know, here, um, in the prairie
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, Southern Colorado, I'd probably
recommend it three foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about every three foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a, put another PVC, uh, tube and
attach that to, uh, the box somehow to
[SPEAKER_00]: your base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what, what do you use to attach it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like a conduit clamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also run a lag bolt through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one run one bolt through there and I
drill it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've had them, what would you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wallow them, wallow their way out and it
rips the PVC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's always fun when you get a
spring boarded PVC pipe, just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flipping up in the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So catapult some shit across the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you got the supports going over
and then do you put one across the middle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd actually recommend three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if you're thinking of it like a
clock, there'd be one at 12 o'clock,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, one at nine o'clock and one at two or
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nine and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got this like arch looking
building with a, a beam that goes down the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle on the top and then down the three
o'clock angle down the nine o'clock angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that feels pretty secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you attach that top hole and the
side, uh, the beams that come across?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, fence posts is the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just dig a fence post at the end of,
um, each end of the greenhouse on a 20
[SPEAKER_02]: foot one, you might want one in the middle
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just arrange the size so that it
meets up with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skeleton beam and fasten it to it with
more, uh, conduit clamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you've done this several dozen
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now pretty much looks like we've got
the skeleton figured out basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we, what do we use for a cover
for a top for this thing to keep the hail
[SPEAKER_00]: and rain off of our beautiful plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you know, uh, if you're,
you know, low in budget, um, a visqueen or
[SPEAKER_02]: just poly plastic from those works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, get the heavier, thicker mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, if you got a better
budget, uh, it was, we sell greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: fabrics, uh, lots of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So greenhouse fabric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and the ranges, you know,
if this, I want to say it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it goes up to like 10 bucks a
square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it starts off way cheaper than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 is high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, you can afford this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys work a little bit through the
winter, you can build this next summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely have you an outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you secure the, uh, the cover
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, and what do they call them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it looks like a, uh, battery,
uh, uh, jumper cable clamp.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little alligator clamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But better, but strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we call them spring clamps,
but I don't think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the nipple clamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Framing clamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get them for like two 50 at Harbor
freight.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go buy a whole bucket of those
literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten in there and bought like four
buckets of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got this little hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you should put a fan in the top guys,
like in one of the peaks at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out a, the shape of the fan and hang a
fan in there because you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out if you can do a blower,
like a grow room blower, that's even
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those work great on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do one coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that sucks about those is
though, uh, they suck up rocks and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of them have plastic blades in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take you a piece of ducting that's,
I don't know, like three foot long and
[SPEAKER_02]: secure it to the side of the greenhouse,
lift it up a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: attach it to the fan so that it can suck
any rocks off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just, I, I don't want to know what
that's sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like keys in the blender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got air in, we've got air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice little greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't want, I'm going to save that
question right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of soil should we use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that depends on your budget and just
your growth style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, should we put them straight into
the dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, or should we use pots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, you know, it also depends on your
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tend to recommend pots,
even though I would rather be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend planting in the ground,
but, um, there's a little more to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you go get like a 30 gallon smart
pot, um, outdoors, I recommend the fabric
[SPEAKER_02]: pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they, they sell the tan ones now
too, which are great because, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: they reflect heat a little better than the
black ones that tend to absorb heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, I mean, if you just went
with your favorite potting soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, just, you know, I recommend probably
going three times bigger in your typical
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick with your regular nutrient schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stick with what you're
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if you want to do organics,
I could spend a whole episode talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some episodes with Sean,
you guys that are all about amending soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are great outdoor mixes in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's personally the way I grow,
um, half of my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do six plants in the ground and
we do six plants in the light depth
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the ones in the ground have been in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been grown in that soil for eight
years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the ones in the greenhouse get my
homemade mixture, which is real similar
[SPEAKER_02]: to, I don't know, roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots organic is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get the, you know, personally I
grow organic, so they get teas and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been playing around with ferments and
stuff like that, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't they love a nice tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed them a nice tea, those plants
take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with the Kashi juice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got these plants in a nice
Kashi juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, I could go off on a whole rant
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, it almost flew over my head,
but as a Kashi juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't know what, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lab lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, that purple stuff and the
fungacy stuff looking stuff is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: great white shark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all kinds of names for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like beard, bar trash can puke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this a nice little light
depth greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some plants in really large pots
or not light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little hoops house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we didn't do light depth on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may discuss that a little more in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may cover, if you're interested in
light depth, it's, uh, you put the plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: on, you take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get another tarp to cover up the sun
so that you can schedule the bitches to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like digging ditches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could teach anyone to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we talk about it in a,
in a past episode.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll, we'll go more over that one in
the future also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you got them in this little hoop
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got large pots with decent soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeding, uh, nutrients that you're
familiar with or a bottle nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's, uh, probably cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, our friend Sean will teach you a
great soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll find the episode number and
insert that in the notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tend to use a little more food,
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I've grown bottle nutrients
outdoors, uh, we normally feed to the top
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If maybe even just a little over,
um, you know, this was with general
[SPEAKER_00]: organic specifically because the plants
can metabolize more because of the sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: the more available co2 and the bigger root
mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think your gavitas are bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ain't got nothing on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me what kind of light
lights to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I've got low ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, stick with your like
Luma tech, those magnums or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when should we expect to see signs
of flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, late July, early August in Southern
Colorado depends on what strains we're
[SPEAKER_02]: working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd imagine that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Indica seemed to 10 or I would say in
my experience, Indica's got a little
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow will take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry will be almost done by the time
golden goat spits out pistols.
[SPEAKER_02]: My government mule just kills it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so speaking of meals, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is kind of good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of problems do you think,
well, we should tell the people to be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we get those damn little moths.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, um, more into your bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're doing light dip and it's
early season, um, you gotta watch out for
[SPEAKER_02]: molds, um, bud rot, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is that something that can be stopped
once it's happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, we could spend, well,
I don't know if PMs of a bastard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I personally don't think,
you know, a little, on a fan leaf here or
[SPEAKER_02]: there right before harvest is one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's on the bud, it's done in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have just seen that for the first
time this year ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it was in, it was in another light
depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they didn't have good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's been, we've had a very rainy
spring, um, and lots of hell and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the humidity has been so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Higher than a lot of outdoor growers are
used to dealing with, um, around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we're using swamp coolers to try
to pull the house on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: His loss or his harvest was by no means a
total loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, he probably lost a plant,
you know, combined out of, I think he did
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 plants in there or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, the rule of averages with
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it was PM where like you can
smell it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, deer love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cows love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, everything that eats stuff loves
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially when it's well cared for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if you know, you know,
just prepare for the animals in your area,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, even cats and dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say cats, rabbits,
squirrels, all the domestic fucking pest
[SPEAKER_00]: animals are going to come at it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to section it off somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these animals don't get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we treat for bugs outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory on outdoor growing and you can
correct me if I'm wrong, you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we don't fuck with nature,
nature will kind of take care of itself
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I feel like if I spray, I'm going to
upset the whole system and a bug that
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't normally dominate will dominate
because whatever should have been there to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat, it will be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like where I grow, I totally agree
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we use very minimal pesticides,
um, very strategic timing, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it depends on how sealed up
your greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a lot of times it's just like a girl
room environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, just don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, um, it is a lot harder for
insects and parasites to survive outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, it's the best grow room in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's got perfect air flow and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as the plants are happy,
aren't stressed out, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think A's and B's probably the strongest
thing I've ever used outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about a spinosad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's something you can do to go
after the moths and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's a something, I mean,
we have bees on our property too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a, you know, always a
consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but spinosad is something that,
you know, we don't really worry about it
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's totally natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like spraying a tea on the plants,
which we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a, it derives from a
bacteria found in the bottle of a rum jar
[SPEAKER_02]: or the bottom of a rum jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a rum barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the wood has something to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that a long time ago somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, Captain Jack's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Captain Jack's to the rescue
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about all the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be prepared for a lot of weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be treacherous out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, imagine being stuck outside all the
time and not being able to come inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to prepare for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to build them in a
dog house or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need love.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I thought we should mention
is be prepared for a lot of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are prepared or
realize how much water your outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how often do you water your outdoor
plants, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well up until, you know, normally it's
once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this year has been a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had to water as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually been a pain in the fucking
ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my, some of my plants are severely
stunted because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, don't catch up though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it'll dry out here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be missing that evening rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, what else was I going to ask you
in the middle of flowering when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: budding out in the summer, are you going
to be watering them twice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, probably so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and ground plants don't need to be
watered as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you water them right, you know,
um, 15, 20 gallons at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's a workout when we do,
um, outdoor and ground water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in the greenhouse, I use the automated
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put little sprinklers and everything
and yeah, that shit's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that just tells you how much
water, um, you know, even smart pots need
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the sun just bakes those pots,
uh, guttalos or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fill the side of one of their,
you know, of a rose pot or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that sitting outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I mean, this, the sun just bakes
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets so fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gets your roots hot, um,
which they can survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need plenty of water to be able
to handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also you said to put mulch on top of
your pots also to shade them a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep moisture in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in ground or in the pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another thing, if you do have black
pots outside, I recommend, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapping them in panoplastic with the
white side out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them a little reflective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of absorbing all that black heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that three, started doing that three
years ago and it seemed to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what I'd like to figure out for these
people is, uh, some no-till, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: talk with Sean, some future stuff about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no-till is neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking into that this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of a last minute opportunity
for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they got the required licensing
and everything, they just went with what
[SPEAKER_02]: they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, which wasn't much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before my computer starts tripping out too
much here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you have any tips for the people
that are starting to grow outdoors for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, water a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're in ground, um, just make
sure the water is soaking down into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, once it starts pulling up,
um, give it a minute, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: see how long it takes it for it to drain
down into the soil that that gives you a
[SPEAKER_02]: real good indication of, um, how damp the
soil is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that, you know, a container is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and you should be able to,
through trial and error, figure out how,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, how much water to put in it,
how much it should weigh, how long it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the earth can be a little more
challenging, um, uh, to aid in that water
[SPEAKER_02]: and put a frame around the plant,
like a three foot by three foot,
[SPEAKER_02]: two by four frame and just put it on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also attach, uh, the big crazy,
uh, tomato cages or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant cages made out of fencing to them
later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a frog in my throat now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, let's, uh, let's wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for 30 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of a podcast for these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let your throat take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat finally is not blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good time to do a closing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll save some stuff for next time
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys, thanks again for listening
to another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will probably be back in a few days with
the news episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are a couple of news articles
out that I want to read and talk about.
