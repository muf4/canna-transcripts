[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frosted Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Dan and Brandy, and you're
listening to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frosted Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 401 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
you can get them through Oregon Elite
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, and you can find them at www
.origaneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Star Guava
HCFSE from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This label says it is 66.2% THC with a
total of 76.5% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this concentrate is just
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the lid off the jar right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have to get it close to my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like ridiculous cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gas and rotten fruit, and it is
deliciously amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of almost makes your eyes kind of
itch a little bit when you smell it real
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color and consistency are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like shiny yellow diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know diamonds are supposed to be clear,
but it's kind of like some shiny citrines,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is beautiful, and I think you
can tell by the early show rambles that
[SPEAKER_00]: this concentrate is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious Star
[SPEAKER_00]: Guava HCFSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following the podcast for a
while, you know that a while back I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long grow series that started at
making a solid strategy and plan for our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and ended with sampling our finished
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great response to that grow
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did the series, there were several
episode interruptions because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great things came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike came over and wanted to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was news to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lessons were kind of broken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be a good idea to
combine those lessons into really long
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be the first compilation of
grow lesson episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will be a compilation of
episodes 351, 52, 54, 55, 56, and 357.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will be about three hours
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode again will be another
chunk of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to re-release all of the grow
lessons in long episode form without any
[SPEAKER_00]: interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's jump into
this first chunk of repost grow lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Cannabis Community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 351 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No long fancy intro today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right into this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Whammy Bar
Nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combo of lemon essence and
papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as honeysuckle,
lemon candy, and lemon candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this one on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the dab I just took tasted a lot
like Kiwi Strawberry Snapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move this podcast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a lot to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been talking about doing a series
of episodes that run my listeners from the
[SPEAKER_00]: very beginning of a grow all the way to
the very end of a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about selecting your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about sprouting seeds and
cutting clones all the way through the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, all the way to flower, all the way
up to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll talk about drying and
curing once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a long series of detailed
episodes, and this will be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: episode in that series.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
planning your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about setting goals for your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also give you a few tips on how
to stay out of trouble and avoid common
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes people make when setting up a new
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've got a solid intro laid
down, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of dabs while
you grab a notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get back, we're going to talk
about planning your cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well-medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well-hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you grabbed a pen and some paper
because there will be a lot of information
[SPEAKER_00]: in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into planning your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we start shopping for lights and
seeds and planning for your first harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a few things you can do to make
your growing experience more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first piece of advice I have for
anybody who is planning to start a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is to buy grow books from reputable
grow authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Authors I can recommend are Ed Rosenthal,
Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell Clark, and Drew West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the second piece of advice is to open
those books and read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you read the whole book before
you start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you know what to expect before
problems arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if a problem does pop up,
you know what you've got because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to diagnose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you don't make the problem worse
by diagnosing a problem under pressure and
[SPEAKER_00]: making the wrong decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get yourself a grow book from a
reputable grower and read that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I like Ed Rosenthal,
Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell Clark, Drew West.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a ton of great cannabis authors
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading books will give you an idea of
what to expect and you'll have an eye for
[SPEAKER_00]: things when they pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have as many surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find books from most of the
authors I listed on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find a lot of great free PDF
files if you do a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to increase your
cannabis knowledge is by listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, I recommend shows
like The Dude Grows and Free Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an advanced grower, I recommend
shows like Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences and Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to learn about cannabis
is through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great cannabis YouTube
channels out there, but you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch cannabis specific videos to learn
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch basic plant biology and
basic horticulture videos and most of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to apply to your cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn about the plants, learn about the
way that they function and learn why they
[SPEAKER_00]: do what they do through those YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would avoid is cannabis
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of crap in cannabis forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why I started this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw people giving terrible advice on
cannabis forums and I wanted to come on
[SPEAKER_00]: here and correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be really careful if you're taking
advice from cannabis forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you avoid them
completely and stick with books,
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts, and YouTube channels from
reputable growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first piece of advice is to buy and
read grow books from reputable growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then supplement that education with
knowledge from YouTube and podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we go too much further with
our plans to grow, we've got some things
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important thing to think about is
legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it legal to grow where you're planning
to set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is illegal, I can't recommend you
grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to tell you to obey the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to grow in an illegal
area, keep in mind that you are now
[SPEAKER_00]: committing a crime that could result in a
life changing experience for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: your family, and everyone in that
household.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were suspected of running an
illegal grow in your home, the police,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly the SWAT team, possibly the DEA
will kick in your door and drag you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your family into your front lawn in your
underwear while they destroy your entire
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take all of your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take your firearms if you have
any.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will probably shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may shoot you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your family is home, they will be
detained and possibly shot if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: react properly to police instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your house is now a drug house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in ready for war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your wife and kids will never forget the
morning the door came off and armed men
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and took you to jail and destroyed
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life will never be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this before you choose to set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is dramatic and it will be traumatic
for you and everyone involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this before you hang up your
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this before you order your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind that you are producing a
high-value product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking now about what you're going
to do if somebody tries to come in your
[SPEAKER_00]: home and take that from you while you are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it now so that you know what
you're getting into before the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've made that important
disclaimer, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about why you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing to supply yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing to supply a sick family
member?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to be the next neighborhood
hookup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to be the next Pablo
Escobar of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the real reason for your grow
and have a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your goal is to supply yourself,
think about how much product you need
[SPEAKER_00]: every 60 to 90 days and set up a grow that
will supply that for yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus maybe a little extra in case you have
an issue or a delay in your next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing enough product to supply yourself
should be an easy goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing enough to supply the whole
neighborhood is when it starts to get
[SPEAKER_00]: risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you hang up another light,
you increase your chances of trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the risks involved before
you expand, and I always recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: starting small, learning how to grow,
and then expand from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about what you realistically
expect from your grow and set a goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow is going to be limited by the
amount of space you have, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment you have, and also the amount of
electricity you can provide to that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your goals, is to figure out how to
maximize the yield from the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: space you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reasonable goal is one pound per
thousand watt light, and a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: light usually is good for about a four by
four to a five by five space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would expect about one pound per
every four by four or five by five foot
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't expect that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn your nutrients,
and you've got to dial in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to give you guys an estimate,
and help you design and set up your room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand how to reach your goals,
you can reasonably expect one pound per
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt light once you get good at
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you really get good at growing,
you should increase that goal to closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: two pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you move into the double ended bulb
technology, you can certainly increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your expectations much more with more
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, all of what I'm talking about
is with high pressure sodium lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have enough experience with LEDs
to give you any estimates or expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is all just rough
expectations, rough estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a pound per thousand watt light is
your general goal once you learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't focus too much on yields when you're
getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus more on learning the needs of the
plant, understanding the cycles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and learning how to see what the
plants are telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus more on that when you get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the yields will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality will come when you develop a
relationship with the plant, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: will fall into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving you a rough idea of what
you can expect once you get dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on track with things we
need to think about when planning our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I've got written down is
safety and security.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in detail
in the next episode, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting and planning your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be overall planning your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode will focus more in on
your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for safety and security, we're going to
go quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to worry about the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already talked in depth about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to worry about thieves and
criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already talked a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So safety and security will be discussed
more in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I've got is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is water accessible and affordable where
you plan to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you have an excuse for the extra
water consumption?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on the list is electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're planning your grow,
keep in mind that you will be very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: by the amount of electricity you can pull
from a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most homes have a one or 200 amp service
depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got 100 amp service,
you will be very limited on how many
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 200 amps of service,
you'll still be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, when they put the
electricity in your house, they did not
[SPEAKER_00]: consider you adding thousand watt grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put just enough for you to run all of
the appliances and things in your house
[SPEAKER_00]: and also plug in the blow dryer and the
microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give you a lot of extra
amperage because they never thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to plug in these high powered
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be limited by the
amount of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go out and buy 4,000 watt
lights, maybe buy two and plug them both
[SPEAKER_00]: in and see if you start flipping breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you won't be able to plug in two
1,000 watt lights into the same receptacle
[SPEAKER_00]: in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little plug in right there,
it's got the plug in on top, the plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your phone plugged into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the computer plugged into the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot plug in two 1,000 watt lights
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run out to the garage or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make it come on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start heating up the
receptacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to blow the receptacle or it's
going to catch the wires on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to plug in 2,000 watt lights
into the same plugin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even be able to run two
1,000 watt lights in the same room if both
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plugins are on the same breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the breakers in your house are
going to be 10 amps, maybe 20 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe 35 amps if you're really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older homes, you're going to have 10s and
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: More modern homes, you may have up to 35
amp breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our 1,000 watt grow lights pull
about 8 to 11 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they fire up, they want to pull 11
amps to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they're running, they'll drop down to
around 7 or 8 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep that in mind when you're
designing and thinking about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much amperage is available in the
space in which you plan to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect to run a bunch of extension
cords because they're going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start flipping breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just realize that you either need to
upgrade the electrical or you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: settle for less lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep in mind that for every light
you hang, you probably need a blower or a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan or some sort of electricities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow extra amperage for your accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also got to run the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to turn on lights in the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if somebody tries to
[SPEAKER_00]: run the microwave and it blows up the
whole grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have pressure sodium grow
light on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about how to
get rid of that discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have empty nutrient bottles that
you need to figure out how to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we harvest, we've got to figure
out how to get rid of that old root ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the sticks and all of that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to start thinking about
before we start buying grow lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: buying our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is the odor
and aroma of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to snitch on yourself by
having a stinky garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a good job, your plants are
going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need some sort of carbon
filtration to prevent the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood from smelling your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something a lot of people don't think
about is when you start cutting down your
[SPEAKER_00]: first grow, it really stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start chopping into those plants,
you start breaking open the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it really stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you thought it smelled good around week
six, seven and eight, wait till you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them down and you start chopping into
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's really going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that harvest stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at harvest time, you've got to think
about that trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think about all that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a lot of herb to learn how
to dry and cure and store.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to dry it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to cure it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to store it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things to start thinking about
before you hang up any lights and buy any
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is a huge thing to think about
when you're planting your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of nutrients are you going to
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go organic or are you
going to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go a living soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to go cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of decisions to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has its advantage and
everything has its disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through this long series of episodes,
I will try to go over the pros and cons of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and synthetic, of hydro and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to talk about all of that stuff
and help you make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is the time to start thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that decision comes pest
control, integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to apply spray applications of
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to use predator bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these options have their pros and
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to find a pest management
system that also works with your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a full organic system,
you don't want to go in there and apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic pesticide that could disrupt the
environment you've spent so much time
[SPEAKER_00]: creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your major things to think about
will be your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run soil, soilless mix,
cocoa, perlite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run rock wool cubes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with that decision, you get to
decide what you're going to feed those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go all organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go full synthetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do a combo?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another major part of that decision
is how you are going to prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your medium, your nutrients, and your
integrated pest management will all become
[SPEAKER_00]: one big unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that in depth before you make
any decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as this series continues,
I will do a lot of discussions on most of
[SPEAKER_00]: those topics and try to guide you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to remain unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about how I grow, and I will
also try to give you unbiased information
[SPEAKER_00]: on other options and other methods that
will work just as well as the way I have
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's part of the beauty of
setting up your own grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no right or wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wrong way is when your plants die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right way is when you are happy and
you're getting what you want out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's producing the quality,
the amount, and you're satisfied,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably improve a little bit,
but you're doing it right, and nobody can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you you're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with it, it's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you're doing it wrong when
the plants die or when you get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, but it's your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make yourself happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you put a lot of thought into
your medium, your nutrients, your pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control, and if you want to go organic or
synthetic, a few more things you should
[SPEAKER_00]: think about are, do you want to grow from
seed or from clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do in-depth episodes in the very
near future on the advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of starting from seed or
clone, and then I will also talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to sprout seeds, and we'll also do
episodes on cutting clones, so I will go
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth on that subject, but start
thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to grow from seed or do you
want to grow from clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a bunch of great things to think
about before you even buy a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy a grow book and read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find more podcasts that you find
educational and entertaining, and listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to those podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe find some YouTube channels that
teach you about basic plant sciences and
[SPEAKER_00]: watch those in your free time,
and get a good understanding of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a lot of other things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalities, safety and security,
water, electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good excuse for how much
electricity you're about to start
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the aroma you're going to
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to make that big debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, medium, organic versus
synthetic, and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to think about seeds or
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of stuff to have on your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is to think about where to
put all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to put the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What room is this going to go in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already see the wheels turning in
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we will go in-depth
about where to put your grow, planting
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in-depth about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about choosing the correct
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in-depth about airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in-depth about all of the
specific needs you need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: when planting your specific grow space in
the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I also told you I would give you tips
on how to stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one tip to stay out of trouble
when working in a grow is to keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a legal area, if you're in
an illegal area, keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does anybody need to know you're a
growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does anybody need to know you've got a
high-value product somewhere in your home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does anybody need to know you've got
an extra stream of income?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your mouth shut, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think, what about my best
friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to turn your best
friend into somebody you can't trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about your girlfriend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, she might not be your girlfriend
forever, and do you want to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit when you guys break up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your family is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bro is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your girlfriend is shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody changes when there is a
high-value product sitting on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody's looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to keep yourself out of
trouble is to not tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another piece of advice is to not stink
like herb all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go places, take a shower,
change your clothes, put on some non-herb
[SPEAKER_00]: stinking clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't always have a bunch of herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start selling herb and making a
bunch of extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start smoking excessively in front
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give anybody any obvious signs that
you've got access to an excessive amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't raise any eyebrows and don't draw
any extra attention to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my quick advice on how to stay
out of trouble when you are starting a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't suddenly have too much money and too
much herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay low-key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay the person you were before you
started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stop paying for herb and start
growing your own.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 352 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by keeping you updated on what I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm taking dabs of Durban Kush sauce
from Contraband Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is labeled as Durban poison and I-95
cross to pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a blend or if
that's actually a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is labeled as sweet and sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cut above bread, selected and
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you that mind eraser sort
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go blank for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got Mike ridiculously high earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lab test printed on the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says THCA 902.9 milligrams,
which equals 90.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC is 21.43 milligrams, which equals
2.1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are no other cannabinoids
detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban Kush sauce from Contraband
Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this energetic, talkative
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will be the second in a
series of Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take us from the beginning of a
grow all the way up to harvest and drying
[SPEAKER_00]: and curing our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we talked a little
bit about planning our grow and setting
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and finding ways to stay out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus more
on planning the specific grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of details written down for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm going to take a bunch more
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back, we'll take a deep
dive into selecting and planning your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back and I am ready to talk about
selecting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up a grow almost anywhere if
you can supply electricity, airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and water to that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you choose to grow is going to
determine a lot of your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a small closet, you'll be
very limited, but you'll still be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a usable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a prohibition state,
you'll need to take extra precautions to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the aroma down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you'll need an excuse for the
extra electrical consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make a quick disclaimer that I
cannot endorse, encourage, or promote you
[SPEAKER_00]: to conduct any sort of illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to follow the laws and obey all
of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't listen to the last episode,
please go back and listen to that long,
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate rant I gave about what will
happen to you if you were suspected of
[SPEAKER_00]: having an illegal grow in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend everyone do your best to
minimize odor and obvious signs of a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in legal environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thieves know how to spot a grow,
and you're entering a gray area that until
[SPEAKER_00]: recently has been run by criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're planning to produce a high-value
product, and people want that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell somebody about that product,
you are asking for trouble, so be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I talked about not
bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself protected by keeping your
mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk more about places to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow in closets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow in pre-made tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow in bedrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can set up giant areas and basements,
and we can even use tiny spaces like our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends Love for the Plant and Love for
the Bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in little micro-grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of your space and the
pre-existing structure will dictate most
[SPEAKER_00]: of your setup, especially in a rental home
and even more so in a prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own your home or if you're busting
out the barn or if you're building out a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse, an illegal area, you have much
more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal spaces for a grow are generally
places with low traffic and something you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep hidden from visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like basements for home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attics are okay, but they're harder to
keep the climate dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is beating right on top of your
grow space, and the home heat rises,
[SPEAKER_00]: so attics are generally warmer places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe my East Coast friends would have
better luck in the attic, while the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado crew will get down in the
basement better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basements are usually insulated by the
earth, so the temperature stays fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can isolate a small section or a
room in the basement, that is usually my
[SPEAKER_00]: first choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People won't be down in your basement
unless you invite them, so it's easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the only issue with basements is when
you have to have a contractor come fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: water heater or the heater or some sort of
plumbing down there, you may need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basements and attics are ideal in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spare bedrooms are great if you have good
control of your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live with other people,
you have to make sure that everyone is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same page with the importance of
security and light control in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live with other people,
and you've got a grow room and a spare
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom, there's a good chance that when
you're gone, when you're on a date,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're asleep, they're going to take
somebody in there and show off your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to do something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn on the light during
the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to leave the overhead light
on and not think about the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the normal room light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the grow lights go off, that normal
light will stay on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have everybody in the house on the same
page if you set up a grow in a shared
[SPEAKER_00]: home, in a shared room with other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is keeping
children out of the grow without
[SPEAKER_00]: supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let your kids help, that's up to
you as a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're growing for the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're growing for a child,
it's great to have that child go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and help with their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can build a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you as a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You parent the way you feel you should do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep the grow room locked and keep the
kids out without supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend a lock anyway, just to make
law enforcement happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone does come to inspect your legal
grow, a lock just makes you look like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to be more responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy step to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garages and outbuildings are also great
places for grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any space in which you can control the
lights, the temperature, and humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can turn into a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a large space and you can't
control the large area, you can buy a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent of almost any size and set that up in
a room to create a more controllable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also set up multiple tents to have
multiple cycles in the same basement or
[SPEAKER_00]: room area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a veg area and two tents with
alternating flower cycles to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of a basement area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about maximization once you get
your rooms dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can maximize a closet or a cabinet or
a warehouse if you set it up correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to keep safety and security in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your new grow option safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, can you handle the
consequences if you get yourself into
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that now before we jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where you set up your grow,
there are a few things to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I feel is most commonly
overlooked is the importance of airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: and air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to exchange the air in a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I stuck you in a closet for 24
hours and I didn't open the door for any
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air or to let out any of the gases
that came from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be alive and you'd be a little
uncomfortable and the air in that room
[SPEAKER_00]: would be so stale and funky that you just
couldn't wait to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be ready for some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants uptake CO2 and release oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to think about where we're
getting fresh CO2 from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the plants function, they release
water vapor that increases the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity of our grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have a plan to get rid of
that excess humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we remove the old air, we need to
replace it with fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most small grows, you'll be able to
replace the air probably with just the
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow that flows from underneath the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a closet grow or a very
small bedroom grow, you'll get enough air
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in through passive vents like
underneath the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your grow tents will have passive
vents built into the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilize those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a powerful enough blower
to extract the warm human air from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of a grow space, you may need to add a
passive intake to allow enough fresh air
[SPEAKER_00]: to flow into your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major consideration is airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get air in and out of your grow
space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't plan on leaving the door open as
part of your plan because what about the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't leave the door open during the
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what about those days when you're
not home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what about that night when you get too
stoned and fall asleep and forget?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on just leaving the door open
as part of your HVAC plan that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work, that is not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your garden a chance and it will be
so much more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it something you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting off with a shitty plan like
trying to remember to close the door every
[SPEAKER_00]: night at 930, that's going to frustrate
you in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've stressed the importance
of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward and talk about
electricity and power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you safely provide electricity to your
grow area without causing a fire hazard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy that burned down your
house with a poorly designed grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the whole grow movement look
bad and sets us all back five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you power a grow light, a fan,
an exhaust fan, maybe an air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatever else you need for the grow
space you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull too many amps from one breaker
for too long because eventually something
[SPEAKER_00]: will melt and you will have a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flip a breaker more than two times
a day, it is time to reconsider your
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be prepared to pay for your
electrical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have a crop for a few months,
but you're going to have lights to pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the first month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for that bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something a lot of young and new
growers forget to plan ahead for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang up your grow light, you plug it
in, you get shit running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, yeah, in like 90 to 120 days,
I'm going to harvest and have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in about 35 days, the bill comes
and you go, oh shit, I got to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred extra dollars because I'm running
this grow light and I didn't consider that
[SPEAKER_00]: plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bill coming every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a new bill to pay for that
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are going to pull a lot of
extra electricity, have a plan to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: electric company why you need an excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they send a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they show up and walk around the
house to check for inefficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, law enforcement can use your
electric bill as probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the new smart meters, they can
probably tell exactly how many kilowatts
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using at exactly which point of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can probably tell that at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: you start pulling 4,000 watts worth of
extra power until 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turns off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably know when you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably know when you're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that sort of stuff in mind when
you're building and designing your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and also when you're selecting your lights
and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about choosing lighting in
a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing we should consider is
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get water to your grow area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your grow space in the attic?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get water to your
attic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to fill up five gallon water
bottles and hook them up this that ladder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you going to run a hose up there
and hope you don't have a catastrophe with
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if your grows in the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a tap down there in the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have access to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where your water is coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, think about runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to dispose of water
occasionally, especially if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: a hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your basement have a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a floor drain, give it a test
before you go pouring a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: water down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a half a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't clog up, pour a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes those floor drains,
they're backed up way down the line and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to pour a bunch of water in there
and then suddenly it overflows into your
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you're going to pour a big
reservoir down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you're going to drain your
hydro gear down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test that floor drain before you rely on
it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also need to think about extra
water consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how big your grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much they're paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if you pay the water bill or
if the landlord pays the water bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just may be something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about water,
I'm going to mention get a good shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get water to your
grow on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use about five gallons of water per
light, per day, maybe every other day when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how much water you're going to
need while you're planning your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really think you want to huck a
five-gallon container of water up that
[SPEAKER_00]: attic ladder for nine weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a medical marijuana patient
now, you will need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be by the end of that grow
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we really need to think
about when planning our grow space is
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness and light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you make your space completely dark
during your dark cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean dark to where it's kind of
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean dark where there's a little
bit of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean dark to where it is scary dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean zero light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay in your grow space for five or 10
minutes with your eyes open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let your eyes adjust to that total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then wave your hand in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand at all,
it is too light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need absolute total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light will potentially cause your
plants to have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants have light during their
supposed night cycle, they might not even
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think you're in flower and you're
still vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be getting just enough light to
where they're kind of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're still kind of vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start taking on weird shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their leaves get strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got a very small light leak,
the area that is getting hit by that light
[SPEAKER_00]: will make hermaphrodite flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will pollinate little sections of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have little seeds in your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need an area that we can keep
absolutely dark during our dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that won't get interrupted by
somebody needing to use the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that won't get interrupted by
somebody needing to do laundry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that won't get interrupted by
somebody going out to the garage to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think ahead of all of the reasons somebody
may need to go in your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like a little grow tent or an
isolated room or the back corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement where nobody ever goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the major things to think
about when building your grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want somewhere discreet and secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to control temperature
and humidity within a very tight range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get about 70 degrees with about
40 percent humidity in our flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need somewhere with adequate power and
available water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also may need an excuse for the extra
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very important factor we keep
talking about is light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have light interruptions in our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep our light scheduled
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark cycle is super critical during
flowering you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be interrupted by the tiniest
amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, grow tents work great
because somebody can't walk into the room
[SPEAKER_00]: and flip on the switch for the light
that's in the room and accidentally get
[SPEAKER_00]: light in that grow tent if you've got it
closed up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave it open for airflow like I
talked about leaving the grow room door
[SPEAKER_00]: open earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave your grow tent open and get
too stoned or get way too into a game of
[SPEAKER_00]: fork knife and totally forget that those
lights went off at seven and you left that
[SPEAKER_00]: room open and now it's eight thirty and
you're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that shit happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you close the grow tent,
you should be safe from light
[SPEAKER_00]: interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered a lot of the basics
of selecting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your needs and your goals and
try to find a space that works the best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you can provide the essentials,
you can make any space work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in that little mini closet
underneath the stairs in an apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in a sketchy attic in a garage
in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in a spare bedroom in Bessemer
and I've busted out basements with
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between two and twelve lights
depending on the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also grown in giant warehouses and
I've done a lot of growing in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The needs are the same in all of those
spaces and a little planning and thought
[SPEAKER_00]: can make your tiny space produce the same
quality as commercial grows if done
[SPEAKER_00]: wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody talk down to you for
growing in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set your finished product next to their
finished product and ask them if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in a big room in a warehouse or in a
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter as long as you are
producing a product that makes you happy
[SPEAKER_00]: and meets your demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody talk shit to you about
the way you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said last time, you're only doing
it wrong if the plants die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I want to mention is
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set up in a basement or a spare
room, try to get anything not grow related
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a solid cleaning of any
space before setting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the space has a funky dingy smell,
like if you're in a basement and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: that basement smell, try to find the cause
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's down there making it funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe get a bunch of fresh air
through that space for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: before you set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe open some windows, get some fans
going, spray some Osium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get rid of that funky smell
because that smell could stick to your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to grow in a funky space
and then you don't want your product to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up smelling like funky basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will if your space has that funk,
especially if you're going to dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: in a funky basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to get rid of that funky basement
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that just by getting air into
the room, get a little airflow going,
[SPEAKER_00]: get that old funky air out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said to clean the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in a room is a spot for a
spider mite or a pest to hang out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some clothes in there,
that's a beautiful spot for a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs just to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to clean up the space and have a
nice tidy grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help you keep everything organized
and it will help you keep bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find a good space, make sure it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can get a lot of airflow to
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can get water to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to provide supplemental
CO2 to your grow space, make sure you can
[SPEAKER_00]: carry CO2 tanks to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tanks are heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you can control the lights
in your grow space and also the darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be sure that you can control the flow
of human traffic in your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you don't want your pets down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not encourage people taking their
animals to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want your pet in the grow,
that's on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go play in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're picking up pests probably from
every plant in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing it right into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't encourage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do what makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you're only doing it wrong
when the plants die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is to make sure this is
something you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will talk about selecting
specific equipment for your specific grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next episode.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 354 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hela Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have become tradition that I
start the show off by letting you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking Today, I'm taking dabs of
the blueberry citron fambrosia from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I described the
flavor as oranges rolled in sugar with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hint of purple laffy taffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be smoking this for a couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the third episode in
my long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past two episodes, we talked a
little bit about setting goals and
[SPEAKER_00]: planning your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talked about more specifically
about selecting and planning your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this episode, we're going to focus
more in on the equipment and choosing the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate equipment for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the right equipment for the size
of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the right equipment to meet your
goals and we need the right equipment to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet our power consumption limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into a podcast all about
selecting equipment for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a previous episode, we talked about
selecting your space and thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your space is really going to dictate
how much light you can put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your amount of electricity available is
really going to dictate how much gear we
[SPEAKER_00]: put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep these things in mind and have
realistic expectations of your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're designing and building your
new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about selecting lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting is probably the number one
decision to make when designing a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small closet or a very
small cupboard area, your lighting options
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be limited to smaller,
lower powered lights that don't put off a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of heat, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they light your small space
appropriately, you don't need a gigantic
[SPEAKER_00]: light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a small closet or a cupboard or
something that's been converted into a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space, like a dresser or an armoire
or a storage cabinet or something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of incognito, something like our
friends at Love for the Plant would
[SPEAKER_00]: create.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a small space,
maybe a T5 light would work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to upgrade from a T5,
your next best option is an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are great for small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED technology has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a lot of personal experience
with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't have a lot of experience in
small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen LEDs kill it in little spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do very well for small home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an apartment or somewhere
where you can't take up a lot of power,
[SPEAKER_00]: an LED is a great option and it works
great in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a closet, in a cupboard or in a small
piece of furniture that has been converted
[SPEAKER_00]: into your little secret home grow space
that's hidden right there in plain sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: A T5 light is probably like your beginner
light, your lowest powered light that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend growing cannabis with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small space, a T5 or an
LED may work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we work our way into something like a
tent or a small enclosure that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: built or maybe a mini room that we have
sectioned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can work your way into
either more or larger T5s, more or larger
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy more of them or you can get
higher powered LEDs or there are also
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halides are great in the
same way that LEDs are because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: put off a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T5s, LEDs and the ceramic metal
halides are going to be fairly low heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is heat but not as much as you're
going to get from the high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge lighting that we're going to
talk about here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the T5, the LED and the ceramic metal
halide are great for a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put off a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do not consume a lot of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are limited on electrical
consumption, those are great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of the T5s, the LEDs and
the ceramic metal halide is that since
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't put off so much heat on their
own, you don't have to buy more cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment to plug in and use even more
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a win-win with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't feel like they put out
the same harvest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That a high intensity discharge light will
put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're limited on space and limited
on electrical consumption and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cool it, those smaller lights are
absolutely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit about high
intensity discharge lighting and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus too much on any specific
kind of lighting or brand because I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: here to really sell you any type of
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you guidance on the things
that you may want to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're thinking about building your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to pitch you specific stuff
because that's up to you to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to customize your grow but I'm
going to give you a really good blueprint
[SPEAKER_00]: and a really good idea of how to get to
your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about high intensity
discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: High intensity discharge lighting is like
a high pressure sodium or a metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are powered by a ballast that you
plug into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ballast generates more power to power
that large high intensity discharge bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put off a lot of light and a lot of
heat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 250 watt high pressure sodium
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they make smaller but I've never
seen it offered in a grow store or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never looked for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used and seen a 250, 400 watt high
pressure sodium and metal halides are very
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600s are fairly common and thousands are
the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using high intensity discharge
lighting in a commercial facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably double ended Gavitas,
which is a whole step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that a little bit later
when we get into the warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a tent, you can use the
T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use ceramic metal halides or you
can work your way into a small high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a 250 in a small tent,
maybe a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go any larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use anything from a 400 to a
thousand watt high intensity discharge
[SPEAKER_00]: light in a five by five tent and you
should be okay if you learn how to control
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to duct the light and
in a moment we will talk about ducted
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going with the tent,
you can use T5 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5s, you got to get them real close to the
plant to get a lot of real productive
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and it takes a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5s, I wouldn't recommend it unless you
absolutely are on a low budget for lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are very brand and style specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn the light you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants you've got together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough experience with the
LEDs, but I've seen some kick ass product
[SPEAKER_00]: come from LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also don't put out a lot of heat and
they don't use up a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great in a tent or a small room
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceramic metal halides are very similar
to the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put off a lot of heat and you
get a quality product that should make you
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be fairly easy to cool
in a small space in a small tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we work our way into the small
high intensity discharge lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you have to start thinking
about cooling the room much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about getting that heat
out and getting fresh air into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start thinking about
ducted lights or open lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about that more in
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just keep in mind for now that the
bigger light we use, the more cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to have to focus on,
which will be more electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pulling a bigger light and now
you're adding more cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doubling up your electrical
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move from a larger space,
from a one light situation to maybe a two
[SPEAKER_00]: or four light situation where we've got a
larger tent or maybe a dedicated room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about our lighting options
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I would move away from the
T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't consider a T5 if you're doing
this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just wasting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four lights, you need
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang up some real lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go with LEDs, get a quality LED,
something with high output, not a little
[SPEAKER_00]: starter LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good one if you're going this
route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or multiple ceramic metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can place them closer together because
they don't take as much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cover more of a footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they cover about a three by three,
maybe a four by four area for the 315
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your LED light is going to be very light
and brand specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should tell you what the footprint
covers on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go a little smaller than that and I think
you'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a room, step away from the T5s,
maybe get a high powered LED, maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple ceramic metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in a room, this is where we can start
using multiple 600 and or multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt high intensity discharge
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've kind of covered the pros and
cons of the LEDs and the ceramic metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make a lot of heat,
but they also don't put out like a high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about the differences
between a 600 and a thousand watt high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium bulb for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: With two 600s, you can cover a little more
space with less shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 1,000 watt, you can cover a really
nice space with a whole lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run two sixes or do you
want to run 1,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the height, how much height
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your ceiling is low, go with the 600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not able to do a lot of cooling,
go with the 600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about 600 watt lights or a thousand
watt lights when you're planting your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 600 watt high pressure sodium light
will be more efficient if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide between a 600 and a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thousand is going to push your
plants just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier what I said about shadows,
what I mean is if you've got 1,000 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb coming from right above all of your
plants, you've got one source of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to create shadows because you
only have light coming from one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have two sixes that are just a
little bit apart, you've got light coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from two directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will give you less shadows,
more of your buds will get light and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually a little more efficient than
one bulb and a bunch of shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is probably a good time to start
thinking about open or ducted light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be clear about what I'm talking
about, when we hang up our grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: that enclosure is known as the reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we screw the bulb into the socket and
cord set that runs to the ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ballast plugs into, it's got another
cord that plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reflector, they are available in
tons of different styles at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now let's think about vented or
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a light that's got glass
between your grow and the bulb so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps that heat in there and we can set up
ducting to move that heat out of the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to allow that heat from the
bulb to enter the grow room and combat
[SPEAKER_00]: that with air conditioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are reasonable options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not ducting your lights means that you've
got to cool that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you've got to add air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about air conditioning options
in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you do choose to vent your lights,
make sure you run the ducting to where
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the odor from your grow is going
to make it out of wherever that air is
[SPEAKER_00]: being expelled from your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to blow that hot cannabis
aroma right into the neighbor's bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when you're setting up
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about carbon filters and odor
control here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about if you want to duct and
have cooled lights or if you want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: open lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got ducted vented lights,
there will be a piece of glass between the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb and your plants that needs to stay
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that means more equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we need a powerful blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some ducting and we need something
running out of the grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly out of the house, which is going
to need to be camouflaged and taken care
[SPEAKER_00]: of discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to ducting your lights is
less cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to need as much air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need one blower to blow
over the lights to get that hot air out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that hot air is going out of the house
or out of your building, you need carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration, which we're going to talk
about in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, most home grows were
designed with ducted lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commercial grows, however,
do not use vented or ducted lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use Gavitas, which are hung really high
because we need them about three feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more from the canopy because they do
get really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so intense, not just from heat,
but so intense from light that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause burn and wrinkle and bleaching on
the tips of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a commercial environment,
we use non-ducted lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, it is very common to see
the ducted lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of home grows now, a lot of guys are
going hard and they're actually hanging up
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower wattage Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging up the Gavita 750s and I'm
seeing great success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to know how to trellis and
control the height of your canopy if you
[SPEAKER_00]: plan on using Gavitas in a basement or in
a bedroom unless you've got extremely high
[SPEAKER_00]: ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a home grow, here's a quick,
just a quick breakdown of how I would do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go carbon filter and I would have
the appropriate carbon filter for the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would have a blower and I would
have an appropriate blower to go with that
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter, either a six inch or an
eight inch, maybe a 10, maybe a 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of the grow and how
many lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then possibly a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have a piece of ducting that sits on
my blower that may be goes to a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running four or six lights,
I will do the Y and I will run three
[SPEAKER_00]: lights parallel or two lights parallel to
where it goes carbon filter, blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then coming off of each side of the Y,
we've got a little ducting, then we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a vented light, a little more ducting,
a vented light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those two ducts, sometimes they come
together, sometimes I don't put them back
[SPEAKER_00]: together, depending on where I'm exiting
with that ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go out of the grow area,
whether out of the house, whether out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the building, just depends on where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it goes out of the room into another
room where it's taken care of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it goes carbon filter, blower,
maybe a Y, maybe not, and then lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe back together, maybe not,
and then out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end there, it's always a good
idea to have something to prevent other
[SPEAKER_00]: things from climbing into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get a mouse that feels a
bunch of warm air coming out of there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh look, a little warm duct and
a mouse or a lizard or somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly a snake, climbs right into your
ducting, ends up in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light cooks itself, maybe makes it all the
way to the blower, shreds itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put something on the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pair of pantyhose works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes to the local Walgreens or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may look like a weirdo if you're a big
dude, but buy a couple of pair of black
[SPEAKER_00]: pantyhose, and then just like a condom,
stretch them over the end of your ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: secure it with some duct tape,
and that way nothing can climb up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell more expensive options to put
at the end of your ducting, but pantyhose
[SPEAKER_00]: will work just fine if you use a couple of
layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a really random piece of advice
while I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got that end going outside,
you're going to have to put some bends in
[SPEAKER_00]: your ducting to prevent light from coming
down that ducting during your dark cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is light outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that ducting that goes,
it's a carbon filter blower, ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: light, ducting, maybe another light,
maybe more ducting, then out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the sun comes up and your lights
aren't on yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that sun is shining toward the
direction of that duct, it'll shine light
[SPEAKER_00]: right down that ducting, and it's
reflective on the inside, so it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce through there and end up into your
grow room, and it'll come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights looking just like a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a low-powered grow light,
but it'll be coming out, and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will think it's daytime because that sun
is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sun will tell them, wake up,
little ladies, and they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some sort of a light baffle outside,
and also bend the ducting on the inside to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and turn off the lights in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into your grow and just hang out and
see if it is totally dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face at all, it is too dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need absolute darkness in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of talk about ducted or
vented lights and non-vented or open
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both got their pros and cons,
but the lighting you decide may dictate a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the rest of your setup,
so be careful when you choose your
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about moving into larger
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a barn or an outbuilding
with high ceilings and a lot of electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, then I would recommend
moving into double-ended bulb technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are much more high output.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do put off a lot more heat,
but the plants will definitely show you
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pull about three pounds per light
consistently from a double-ended bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know earlier I said I would try not
to talk about brands and pitch brands to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but the industry standard for the
double-ended horticulture bulb in a
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado commercial grow facility is,
of course, the Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try not to recommend too many brands
to you, but I'll tell you straight up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the Gavitas if I were going to
build a large grow right now, as many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them as I can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want about one Gavita per four by four
or five by five foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a warehouse or a commercial
environment or maybe a large barn with
[SPEAKER_00]: high ceilings, I would always recommend
the double-ended technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would recommend a Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they do produce a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need more cooling if
you're using Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need those high ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you keep your Gavita lights
about three feet, maybe more, from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've got some serious cooling,
you want those lights about three feet
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the top of your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of flower, if you've got big
giant buds, you still need three foot of
[SPEAKER_00]: space, or you're going to start burning
and bleaching the tips of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for veg, you can use whatever kind of
light you're comfortable with vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: C5s work for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs and ceramic metal halides will
definitely work for veg for smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get into a commercial
grow, I would recommend 400s, 600s if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, or even just veg under your 1000s,
or in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to veg under Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make metal halide and high pressure
sodium bulbs for your Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because I know somebody is going
to ask for vegging, we prefer metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more of the blue spectrum for veg
that keeps your plants shorter and helps
[SPEAKER_00]: them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: For flowering, we want high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more of a orange and red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you bigger fruits and
more growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So metal halide for veg, high pressure
sodium for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way different spectrums are going to be
available for your LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your specific light
manufacturer's options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many options for LEDs that I
cannot even get specific, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's quickly recap lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tent or a small space,
T5s are a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could work with a small ceramic halide
or maybe a very small 250 watt high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium, but I wouldn't go much
more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start working into the smaller
tents or a small room, that's when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start introducing the bigger lights,
the small HIDs, the 250 or a 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get yourself a five by five tent,
that's when you can step up to a 600 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 1000 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start working on a production
grow, you're busting out a whole room,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dedicated space, or maybe a larger tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can work your way into
multiple 600s or multiple thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're going to run a
warehouse, I highly recommend double ended
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I recommended the Gavitas and they
do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that your lights are
going to heat the room very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need appropriate air
conditioning and you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about air conditioning and
then we will work our way into air flow
[SPEAKER_00]: and odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air conditioning, cooling, in a small grow
environment, you can probably get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with a small window air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe you don't have the option of
installing a small window air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use those portable air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on wheels and they have ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a duct that brings the air in
and a duct that shoots the old hot air
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use those, but I do not use the
end duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use the duct that shoots the heat
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the air from my grow room being
recycled in the grow, so I'm not bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: out that air from outside and introducing
it into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no filtration in that air
conditioner before that air gets into my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, so I don't want to suck in some
weird stuff and bring it into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't use that duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use the out duct on a portable air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those portable air conditioners are
very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cost a lot of money to buy and they
cost a lot of money to run, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: very discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very portable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll cool the room down very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of roll it right to where you
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about with air
conditioning is you've got air going out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your grow room now that is not
filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room with your grow is right up
against your neighbor's house also,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that air conditioner in that
window may not be an option because you
[SPEAKER_00]: might start blasting that sweet ganja
smell right into your neighbor's bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to be trying to sleep
and they're just going to be dreaming
[SPEAKER_00]: about smoking a joint at a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful where you duct your air
conditioning air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another really important thing to
think about is how much air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: do we need in a small grow and a
residential grow, not a warehouse type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using thousand watt high
pressure sodium lights, I recommend about
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000 BTUs of cooling per thousand watt
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that again for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend 3000 BTUs of cooling for every
thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got two lights, you want
6,000 watts of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four lights, you want 12,000
watts of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend go a little extra because
it's been hot lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every summer it gets hotter and hotter and
I don't want you to struggle in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the companies that make the
portable air conditioners make a 14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: BTU unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just about perfect for a 4,000
watt light setup, which is beautiful for a
[SPEAKER_00]: spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're in a tiny grow like a closet
or maybe a space that you've built,
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you can't install an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you're going to have to cool that
is by putting a blower somewhere in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and exhausting the heat out of that
enclosure into the main room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling air in through maybe a passive
duct from the room that's already got nice
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the room, it's probably
comfortable for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're ducting out that hot air and
just pulling in fresh air through a
[SPEAKER_00]: passive vent in like a small enclosure,
that will work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you've got enough power to
suck the air out of that sort of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a small enclosure, you're going to
have to use a blower to close it or to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool it and you're going to have to use
passive air from the room to cool that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, if you're in the room,
if that's where you live, if that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hanging out, it's probably
comfortable for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be perfect, but in a
small enclosure, that may be the best you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about cooling a giant
facility, a warehouse or maybe a small
[SPEAKER_00]: barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to cooling Gavita lighting,
it is a totally different ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we moved into industrial
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we move into rooftop units.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't use little wall units and
portable units anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get big boy air conditioning
and HVAC setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're setting up an industrial grow
and you're going to hang Gavitas,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will recommend between four and 6,000
BTU per Gavita or one ton of cooling for
[SPEAKER_00]: every two Gavita fixtures in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I will recommend is in
instead of one large rooftop unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's say you need 30 tons of cooling
in your room, I would recommend that you
[SPEAKER_00]: break that 30 tons up amongst multiple
units so that if you have a failure in one
[SPEAKER_00]: unit, you can still run at three quarters
or half of your capacity and not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: shut down the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep it just cool enough to
survive with three, but you've got four
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time, one breaks, you've still
got three running strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can push it and keep the room
cool, you're still in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one 30 ton unit and it dies,
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are going to turn off because
it's a hundred degrees in there in no
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my suggestion to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divide your HVAC into multiple units so
that when one of your units fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a major backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, your HVAC units will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my number one complaint in a
commercial facility, the HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always takes a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always an HVAC issue somewhere
that I've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is never a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of HVAC guys on a first name
basis, I've got their name and number
[SPEAKER_00]: right on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are on speed dial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Siri is familiar with the HVAC crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really don't be a cheap ass when it
comes to HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're building a home grow,
if you're building a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really recommend you get a good air
conditioner and keep that room nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will be really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get them in the low seventies or
the high seventies, low eighties,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will really show you a difference
from when you had them in the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a huge difference in your
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality, the terpenes, the weight,
everything will be better when you cool
[SPEAKER_00]: them down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a really small space, you're just
going to have to use air exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work in a larger
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to figure out air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a window unit, if you're cutting a
hole in the wall and creating a window for
[SPEAKER_00]: a window unit, that's always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, it's going to blow heat
out the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're heating up the other side of
that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got yourself one of those
portable air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing has a duct that goes outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing to that duct that I
recommend you did to your light duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little panty hose over it to work as
a condom so that you don't get a mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing up into that or a lizard climbing
up into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's kind of cool outside and they
feel that warm air coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, that feels cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just climb right up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put something over it to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we move into a larger grow,
you may need more window units or more
[SPEAKER_00]: portable ACs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those don't cut it, there's always
the mini split option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of skipped over the mini split.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mini split is a big unit that sits
outside and then it runs conduit through
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and the mini split hangs on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three feet long and it just
looks like a vent on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is an air conditioner vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of a mini split.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those run about 30,000 BTUs of
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got about eight to 10 lights,
a mini split may be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure they do make them in stronger
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we move up into an industrial grow
and that's where we start recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: rooftop units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm going to recommend four to
6,000 BTUs of cooling per Gavita or one
[SPEAKER_00]: half ton of cooling per Gavita fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every two Gavitas you hang,
you do need one ton of cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know how to light the room and
get it real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've talked about a few ways to
cool the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about airflow and
odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide to run ducted lights or if
you decide to run an exhaust vent in your
[SPEAKER_00]: room to expel humidity or still air every
so often, I would highly recommend you add
[SPEAKER_00]: a carbon filter to that extraction fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to send unfiltered air out
of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the cannabis busts happening in my
city are based on a neighbor complaining
[SPEAKER_00]: of odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neighbor says, Hey, that smells too
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decide which house it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops come, they knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up and knock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, Hey, the neighbors say it smells
too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: How strongly of cannabis here do you have
a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You either say yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they make their next move.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say yes, they say, can we look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they come in and take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the right amount of plants,
if you're not over your count,
[SPEAKER_00]: they high five you and they say,
sorry to bug you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they leave and they tell your
neighbor, shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got enough plants and he's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too many plants,
shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you probably say, no,
you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they go, yeah, cause you got
too many plants asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when things escalate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: By growing stinky weed and advertising it
to the neighborhood, get a carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the appropriate size carbon filter and
blower for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you blowing it over the lights to try
to cool the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you also using that carbon filter
blower and ducting system to pull air in
[SPEAKER_00]: through passive vents in that room while
cooling those lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause yes, that will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you're sucking your
air conditioning, cooling out of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also my theory is that that air
conditioning cooling is also helping cool
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulbs as it passes over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the way I have one gross
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, do you need to move a whole bunch
of air over lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to move it a long distance or
do you just need to run that air through a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter and out of the room to get
rid of excess humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to do that,
hang your carbon filter up as high as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can in the middle of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the humidity is hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I always recommend the carbon
filter up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about your use of that carbon
filter and that blower and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a huge blower and a small
filter, you're going to suck a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of air through a filter and it's not going
to get filtered appropriately and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to blast that stank right to the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the appropriate blower and carbon
filter for anything that is going to exit
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend the fat filter and the
fresh filter because I have used both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both work very well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both last about 18 to 24 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't see a difference in either
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only recommend them because I was
satisfied with both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both affordable and they both
did what I needed them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forcing a bunch of air out of this
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner is going to send air
out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've probably got an extractor fan
blowing humidity out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we need to replace some of that
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do that through a passive
vent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use a powered fan to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your small enclosures,
your closets and probably your small spare
[SPEAKER_00]: bedrooms are going to have enough passive
vents to allow enough air to get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: room to replace that air we're pulling
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably come in through under the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot more space than you realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you calculated that half inch gap by
three feet, that's a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of air can flow through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are replacing a lot of that air
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to replace the air much more
quickly, you can make a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're getting a whistle
from under that door and it's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the door off when the air conditioner
comes on, if you've got pressure in there
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's trying to blow the door off one
or the other, you may need to relieve some
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a passive vent may be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start with a three inch hole or maybe
a four inch hole somewhere low on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make my intake vents low and my
outtake vents high because the cooler air
[SPEAKER_00]: is lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make a couple of holes and of
course you're going to have to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of a way to make it lightproof
and also maybe consider stapling one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those HEPA filters over it to prevent any
bugs or anything from traveling from room
[SPEAKER_00]: to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a passive vent is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put a dryer vent over it once I've
made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a four inch hole fits
perfectly for a dryer vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just put a little dryer vent
over it and that way no light will shine
[SPEAKER_00]: through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also real low to the ground so
you don't have as much light risk coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But put it low to the ground, put the
dryer vent over it and you'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a four inch passive vent into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when the air conditioner is blowing
out all that stale air and while your
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fan is sucking out humidity up
top, you've got some passive fresh air
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in through that hole in the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take any electricity or
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you really want to blast more air
in there, get one of those squirrel cage
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, cut a hole in the wall, mount that
squirrel cage fan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run ducting or however you want to
do that and just blast more air in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's something you want to do,
it's probably not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want air exchange and airflow in the
room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a giant tornado when they're
beating our plants up, but we do need air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small grow, I like to put one fan per
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a small bedroom with four
lights, why not hang up four fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you get plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get any hot spots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a larger grow, I understand that is not
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not make any sense to hang a
hundred fans in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to place a fan about every six to
eight feet on the wall and depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the height of my tables or my benches or
my canopy, that decides where I place my
[SPEAKER_00]: fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely lower than the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be just between, hopefully they'll
be between the lights and where the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: my canopy ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm using Gavitas, I've got a three
foot space between the light and the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in that three foot space,
that's probably where I would have my
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, probably right at the bottom of that
three foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Gavitas, three feet, and then a
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another environment, you're probably
going to have a light and then maybe like
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot, maybe two, and then your fans,
and then the top of your plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you want to hang your
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small environment, like I said,
about one fan per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a larger environment, I know that's not
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to go about one fan
every six feet on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can attach fans somewhere
in the middle of the room to some poles or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that will always help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to beat the plants to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a hurricane in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to move that air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to rustle the leaves nice and
gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I discovered some fans that
mount to the ceiling and they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pull air from the ground up and they've
got a louver that spreads the air outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air comes from the ground up and
then it spreads it across the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that falls back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are great fans for any
facility that is using CO2 augmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring that unused CO2 up off the
floor and redistribute it back amongst the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also creates a lot of air flow in
the grow without excessive wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look into those fans if you need more
air flow in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're in a home grow,
you can get those fans that are on a stand
[SPEAKER_00]: at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basic stand fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy them right at the start of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they go on sale, go to Lowe's and
clean them out because they'll be on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to buy your fans at the start of
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them in the winter and they are on
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summer, they are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a grower trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to put fans low in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be odd to see a fan on the
floor in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy those square box fans and just set
one on the floor in the corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing right toward the other corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to help a little bit
more air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And air flow is always your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it will help if you spill some
water, if you need the floor to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fan is always your friend to help you
dry up a spill.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've covered lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have covered HVAC and cooling and air
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the next couple of details
we should think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidification and dehumidification,
depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: These may be crucial elements for your
grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have days where it will be 95 and it
will be hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the night, it'll drop to the
high fifties and it will rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use every piece of equipment in our
HVAC arsenal in one day in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the heater in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the air conditioner all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the dehumidifier all night and
we will use the humidifier all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about those items.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small space, maybe you can
get by with just a small humidifier like
[SPEAKER_00]: you would use for when you're sick or just
to humidify the baby's bedroom or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get a small one from Walmart and
maybe that'll work for like a small tent
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe a small bedroom grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're moving into a bigger
environment, you do need a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial size, industrial use humidifier
or dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say I don't like to recommend
brands, but when you're entering into the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial dehumidification game,
I am of course going to recommend a Quest
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units on wheels are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very expensive and very
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units that hang from the ceiling are
what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to set my dehumidifier up on
something like a Smart B or a PL grow unit
[SPEAKER_00]: and have something like that trigger it so
that you can dial in that room perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: set the dehumidifier knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a knob on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn that almost all the way up,
plug that into a trigger that is triggered
[SPEAKER_00]: by another monitoring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit the appropriate humidity
level, that thing will trigger on for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love setting up a dehumidifier on some
sort of a triggering device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the rooms dialed in so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some more to run that water off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say you can use that water
that's collected from a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped doing it because after a while
the coils in that dehumidifier gather funk
[SPEAKER_00]: and that funk ends up in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, funky shit ends up in the tube that
drains from the dehumidifier into whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're catching it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen weird shit come out of that
dehumidifier water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it to be unsafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said about your HVAC units,
I would recommend buying multiple small
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifiers if your budget works for
that instead of one large dehumidifier for
[SPEAKER_00]: when that dehumidifier breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still at least control the
humidity a little bit with unit number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you keep the filters on
your dehumidifiers clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small unit or a large unit,
it will make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendation for humidification
and dehumidification is to find a unit
[SPEAKER_00]: that is appropriate for the size space you
are trying to humidify or dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find something that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't worry too much about the
controls on the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's got an off and on,
we can plug it into something that will
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger it, and that will help us dial in
our humidity levels right where we want
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want more guidance on humidity
levels and vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend listening to the vapor
pressure deficit episode that I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is episode 314, Vapor Pressure
Deficit Bug Poops and Testing Samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
about 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have given you a lot of
information to absorb when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting equipment for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still a few details I would like
to cover, but I think I'm going to save
[SPEAKER_00]: that for the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we'll talk more about
controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to plug everything
into?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to use to monitor the
environment in your room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to use to trigger your
humidifier, your fans, your dehumidifiers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your extraction fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to use for that sort of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also talk about pots, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will talk a little bit about
integrated pest management and how all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things need to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start wrapping up this
episode.

[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, somebody has been smoking all
this time, and you can find them at the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about planning your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about planning your
lighting, your air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to handle airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this episode, we're going to talk a
little bit about how to control all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff and what to plug all of those
things into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into selecting your
equipment part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we'll probably need to
think about is what are we going to plug
[SPEAKER_00]: the light into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you can plug it directly into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to be on 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on yourself or your high
roommate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe your girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on anybody but technology to
turn that light off and on at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need consistent light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a controller for that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest route to go is just a basic
on-off timer that you can program to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: from a certain time and off at another
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend digital timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a timer with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an analog timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: An analog timer, you plug it in and you
spin it to the correct time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you push pins down for when you
want the light to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you leave pins up for when you
want the light to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you set it to the correct time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it's plugged in, that dial
spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the time comes, it clicks
the lights to the appropriate on or off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it keeps spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a power interruption,
that timer stops spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever time the power goes out,
that timer thinks it's that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes out at three o'clock,
it's always three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the electricity comes back,
then it starts back up at three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights will come on and they'll run
until they're programmed off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a digital timer with a battery
backup, if you have a power failure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the power goes out at three, your clock
and your timer keeps ticking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the lights come back on,
your grow room is still on the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you did get that dark period from the
light interruption, but you were now back
[SPEAKER_00]: on your regular grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to throw your whole
grow system off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend if you're going to buy a
basic plug-in timer, I recommend a digital
[SPEAKER_00]: timer with the battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you get a timer that is
rated to support enough amperage or
[SPEAKER_00]: voltage for your grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for one light, a small plug-in timer,
it goes straight into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set the time on that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set your off and on scheduled times,
and the light will go off and on when you
[SPEAKER_00]: expect it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one light, that's a really easy,
basic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug 1,000 watt into that with no
problem in most homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they do make another timer that has two
outlets on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that timer, you can plug in probably
two 600s, definitely two 400s,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a four and a six, but I would not
recommend attempting to plug in 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: watts unless you've done some electrical
upgrades in that home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to plug in 2,000 watt lights
into one outlet without any upgrades,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've said that a couple of times in
these episodes, but I want you to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind when you're thinking about
building your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, no, my house will
probably be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your house isn't special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have magic breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't buy magic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to flip breakers if
you put too much electricity through them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you also start running a risk of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts getting weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more time you flip that breaker,
the weaker it's getting, which also means
[SPEAKER_00]: you're heating up the receptacles,
which also means you're heating up the
[SPEAKER_00]: wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stressing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, that equals fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quit pressing your luck,
reduce your amount of lights, settle for
[SPEAKER_00]: having less lighting, or pay for the
electrical upgrades that are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another idea that people get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plug in the timer, then they plug in
the power strip, and then they plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: their light and other accessories into
that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure if you're going to do that,
that that power strip is strong enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: rated to support the voltage and amperage
for all of the electronics you're plugging
[SPEAKER_00]: into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can't plug in another light just
by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to blow up that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to short out, or you're going
to short out the receptacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already talked about the things that
are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug in an extension cord,
or a power strip into your timer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide multiple plug-in spots so that
they all come on at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do not overload that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe have the light and a fan come on at
the same time with the power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a light and two small fans would
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a light, a blower, and a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't think you can outsmart
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you got smart by plugging in a
power strip, and then you were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: overload that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timer will just crap out on you,
and then it'll be dark, or it'll catch on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one light, a timer plugged directly
into the wall, then the light plugged into
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is perfect for one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also possibly run two lights if
you're running four 600 watt lights with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dual timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available at your grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be available at your local hardware
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is certainly available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we always recommend you shop
locally at a mom and pop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid those big box stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've said things like Lowe's and
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that because I know you guys have
those, but if you have a smaller local
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we know how to control one
or two lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just use a basic horticultural timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug it into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug your light into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if we want to run three,
maybe four, maybe six or eight lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do then?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step to that is electrical
upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that a lot when we
talk about these lessons because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to put yourself or your house in
danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So electrical upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do four lights in a
room, you will need electrical upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're doing the electrical
upgrades is the time to start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about your lighting controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have a plug that looks like
the plug that plugs into the dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are sold with just bare wires
at the end that you have to hardwire in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind when you're designing
your space and selecting your controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hardwire your controller
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to be a permanent fixture or
do you want something you can plug into a
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer type plug in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe you can upgrade or
downgrade or replace that unit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this now while you're planning
your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about lighting controllers
while we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by a lighting controller?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lighting controller is basically a large
timer that, like I said, it either plugs
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dryer plug or it's hardwired
right in and it's got multiple plugins on
[SPEAKER_00]: it to where you can plug in four,
six, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 12 lights on one of these
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 24 lights on a flip box on
lighting controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Gavita Master Controller will run 48
lights at one time, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on something you may find
in a HomeGrow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lighting controller and a small
HomeGrow, you may find a box with a timer
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, with a bunch of plugins in it,
with a cord that comes out, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plugs into the 240 or it's hardwired
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that one timer will function all of
the plugins on that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may also be a switch that will allow
a couple of those plugins to operate
[SPEAKER_00]: independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can stay on all the time or you
can flip a switch and they work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the boxes have that, some of them
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power box is what I'm speaking of
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, instead of plugging a bunch
of timers in and trying to sync them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and plugging all your lights into four
individual timers, you put up a light
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set the timer on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set the light schedule you want on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either hardwire that in or you plug it
into the dryer fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you plug your grow lights into that
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the schedule lighting cycle
comes on, all four lights come on at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it goes off, all four lights go off
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to deal with a bunch of
timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to try to sync up four
different timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to try to fit four timers
in one spot and plug lights into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all easy to program with one unit,
with one timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different brands of
lighting controllers available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, I recommended a digital timer
with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend something similar
with your controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do offer a light controller that has
a timer with a battery in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the power does go out, that timer
stays on the same cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's digital or it's analog,
on your lighting controller, try to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for one with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have a power failure,
it doesn't throw everything off schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a home grow or maybe a small garage
grow or something like a shed grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably recommend a power box or
a Titan lighting controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't recommend a lot of brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from brands,
but those are going to be the two that are
[SPEAKER_00]: most affordable for somebody trying to get
into a medium sized grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often talk about a four light room that
I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that room, it is controlled by a power
box, DPC 7500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the dryer plug that plugs into a
dedicated dryer type plug in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the unit has spots for four plugins
that are synced up with the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are two plugins that you have
the option of pressing a switch and those
[SPEAKER_00]: plugins either work with the timer or they
are on continuous, which means they never
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those four main plugins that work
with the timer, I plug in four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those other two plugins, I've got a fan
and my main extraction blower running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all operating off of that one
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options when it comes
to lighting controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start thinking about that as we design
our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to plug our lights into
something and we've also got to keep our
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lighting controller will be a huge
decision in designing your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about your air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to control your air
conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to plug it directly into the
wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to plug it into one of those
accessory switches on the power box that
[SPEAKER_00]: is constantly on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, are you going to
use the thermostat on the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: and rely on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we going to plug the air
conditioner into another trigger device
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a sensor that hangs in the middle
of the room and pays attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a few things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are buying your air
conditioner, if you plan on plugging it
[SPEAKER_00]: into another triggering device,
make sure you buy an analog air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner with analog controllers like a
knob that clicks like a high medium low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your digital air conditioners
won't work if you try to trigger them with
[SPEAKER_00]: another device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's how it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have a switch that plugs into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That switch will have
[SPEAKER_00]: a setting that says, I want this device
waiting from the middle of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's going to happen, it's going to
say, oh, it's reached the temperature we
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't reach up and hit the off switch
on the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply cuts off the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's no power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has reset on your digital
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes back on, is that digital air
conditioner going to come back on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous setting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just going to come back on and
blink and wait for human interaction to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the downfall of digital devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only plan to trigger your air
conditioner with the air conditioners on
[SPEAKER_00]: board controls, you can get a digital air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan to run your air conditioner
through another triggering device,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend an analog air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make the same recommendation when
it comes to humidifiers and dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to plug them into the wall and
let them work off their own functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: off their own settings, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be just fine for a tent or a
small room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to dial it in,
I recommend something that can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity measurement from the middle of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about earlier with the air
conditioner, you would have a cap switch
[SPEAKER_00]: that plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would have a humidistat controller on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would say when the humidity gets to
this point, activate this, power this
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even know what's plugged into
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just knows that it needs to power that
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the humidity gets below here,
turn that switch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cap switch then has a humidistat on a
cord that we can hang in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can get our humidity
measurement from a more appropriate place
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of down on the corner on the floor
where the humidifier or dehumidifier is
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a cap switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plugged into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got settings on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a corded humidity reader on it
that hangs in the center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we plug our humidifier or
dehumidifier into that cap switch and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is activated by the readings from the
center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: These extra controllers are not necessary,
but if you really want to dial in your
[SPEAKER_00]: room to a precise humidity range and a
temperature range and get that vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit dialed in for your
plants, these types of devices are what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make cap switches to trigger
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trigger your fans, your blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up cap switches to trigger any
type of grow room equipment if your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment is compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the type of air conditioner,
dehumidifier, and or humidifier that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: knob where you can set to high and then
you can plug those into other devices that
[SPEAKER_00]: will control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when they're necessary,
they just come on at their highest and
[SPEAKER_00]: they activate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you reach the parameters you
need, they turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that to work, we need devices that can
handle power interruptions that won't
[SPEAKER_00]: reset their settings when they come back
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's the basic equipment to set up
an analog grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about automating things a
little more and also giving ourselves the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to make adjustments from a remote
location and also turn off and on
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment from remote locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to monitor our grow and make
changes on the fly with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced technology that is available for
our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several options for setting up a
more automated grow room through
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to avoid pitching specific
brands and specific products here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for this example, I'm going to use a
specific piece of equipment and a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: brand of equipment to paint a picture of
how we can set up an automated grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience with this
device and with this equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it makes it easy for me to draw the
plan in my head, which makes it easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to kind of convey the idea to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of how I set up the
automation at a recent facility I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with, and I'm going to try to stay away
from mentioning brand names and
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary specific names of their
devices, but this is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brand comes with, their product comes
with a brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brain syncs up through WiFi to your
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set up an account, you create a
password, then you design your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bedroom, just go make
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two bedrooms, make two
bedrooms, give them a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you enter your flower rooms,
flower A, flower B, flower C, however you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just type them in and you create the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you select a room on the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a small home grow,
it's probably just the flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one room that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's where the next fun piece of
equipment comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next piece of equipment looks like a
basic power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a plug that plugs into the wall
and then it has four available plug-in
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It plugs into the wall and now it connects
wirelessly to that brain unit that is
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that power strip has four slots in it
that are numbered one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you open up the application on your
phone and it will show you that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: plugged in that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The app has found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain says, hey, this is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want me to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, that is in room one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You assign it to a room number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've already got a room started with
a piece of equipment in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's got four slots on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can assign each of those four slots to
be a different piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say slot one is my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to scroll through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little dial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what is plugged into slot one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it HVAC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it irrigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slot number one is a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slot number two is an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slot number three is a blower and slot
number four is a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just being hypothetical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got all of the devices
assigned to that power strip, you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and set settings for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our light is plugged into spot number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to lighting and you set a
lighting schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hit save.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now slot one will act accordingly to
the schedule you have just set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air conditioner is slot two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to HVAC and you tell it,
I want it to stay this temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it gets too hot, it'll fire up slot
number two on that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each spot on that power strip will act
as program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to say, how does it know
what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's another device in the box
that hangs in the very center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this device has a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and humidity sensor that takes
a reading every 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every 15 seconds, it takes a fresh
reading and it sends the information back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the brain unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brain says, okay, so it's 9 AM,
which means the lights need to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep that switch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten up to 84 degrees in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to turn on the air conditioner
and let's check on the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need to turn on that device
and the fan that goes with the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that came on too probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your lights are on, the air
conditioner is on, the fan's blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dehumidifier doesn't need to be on,
so it's just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every 15 seconds, that unit's going to
keep taking measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it sees that we've gotten
down to the parameters we've programmed
[SPEAKER_00]: in, then it will turn off that air
conditioner, that fan will turn off,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights will stay on, and that
dehumidifier will be right there on
[SPEAKER_00]: standby for when we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit I'm talking about also has the
ability to measure the moisture content in
[SPEAKER_00]: your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running Rockwell cubes,
if you're running cocoa, if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, whatever type of medium you're
working in, this device has the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the moisture content in your
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you can set up automated
irrigation when the plants reach a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put these little sticks in your medium
and you calibrate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They link up to the water content sensor
controller, which wirelessly hooks up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain, which wirelessly relays to your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that moisture content meter is
constantly, every 15 seconds, taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meter in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sending that reading up to the little
brain, which is sending it back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: main brain, which is sending it to your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have the equipment installed,
you can go to that room, you can open the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation tab on your phone, and you can
tell it to water that room when it gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell it to water for a certain
amount of time, or until it reaches a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the way you would do that,
you would plug your irrigation pump into
[SPEAKER_00]: that power strip I spoke of earlier,
or you can add another one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: specified power strips that syncs up
wirelessly to the brain, which then syncs
[SPEAKER_00]: wirelessly to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you plug your irrigation pump into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the irrigation tab in the
application and you tell it when to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the plants get dry,
it simply sends electricity to plug number
[SPEAKER_00]: four, or whichever plug you assigned as
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll activate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start watering once it gets wet
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will know, because it's got a moisture
content sensor in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will say, wet enough, and it'll
send a signal to the brain, and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: discontinue powering your irrigation pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a lot of ways to irrigate
your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running a flood and drain
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will just tell it when to flood
and drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running pots with an
automated drip system, like we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you do it, basically, you are just
triggering the pump to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it knows when to come on, because
we've got those moisture content sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed into our medium at specified
intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unit I'm talking about allows you
to have six different water probes in
[SPEAKER_00]: different locations hooked up to one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are six wired probes that go back
to one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one unit then wirelessly sends the
data back to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brain relays it to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we've dialed in automated
lighting, automated air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: automated dehumidification and
humidification, and now we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: automated irrigation, we have almost got a
fully automated grow room with very basic
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, not a huge budget if you
shop smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's exciting to get everything
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it just to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun watching the machine happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just stand in the corner of the
grow room and look at a timer and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in about 10 seconds, and you would know
that that's going to switch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bells are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whistles are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a big game of mousetrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels really great to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of that being said, some of my
favorite advice is keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm calling you stupid,
but that's the way the saying goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that feel better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to make everything
elaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small grow does not need a lot of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more electronics you have,
the more knobs and dials and bells and
[SPEAKER_00]: whistles you've got, the more shit can go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a light and a fan and an air
conditioner, and some way to pull stale
[SPEAKER_00]: air and heat out of that room,
you have got all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is fun to trick out the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to have accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to have toys, and it's also going
to improve your quality if you dial it in
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend money on a bunch of toys just
to have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what's necessity, and think
about the order in which you need your new
[SPEAKER_00]: toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip off of my notes here,
and I'm going to say, instead of spending
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of money on some automation,
why not buy yourself a better pH pen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to talk later about pH pens
and EC meters, but now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of spending a lot of money on
automation, you need a quality pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to look like shit
without proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting together a budget,
and you're trying to include
[SPEAKER_00]: auto-watering, and you're trying to decide
between a quality pH pen or maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy auto-watering stuff, I highly
recommend you go with a good pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add auto-watering later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy fancier toys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a tight budget, get the
necessities first, and then we can expand
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the right stuff,
you're not going to have a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product, and it's all going to be a giant
waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about controlling everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that I want to include,
but I'm not sure where it fits in,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm just going to tag it in right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about CO2 augmentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to add CO2 to your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably going to require you
making extra trips to either the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store or the commercial gas place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our local place here is called Airgas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to buy or rent a
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get that refilled
as frequently as you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how often it's going to need
to be refilled in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how well-sealed your room is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much CO2 your room starts
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much CO2 you're trying to
get it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how often you'll need your
containers filled, but for CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: augmentation, you're going to need either
those big tanks or a CO2 burner,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will have to be hardwired into your
natural gas line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanks are probably the easiest way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to get the tanks, get them to
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not an able-bodied person,
this could be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger tanks are hard for me to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller tanks are not light either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got the tanks to the room,
now you require a regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This screws onto the nozzle on the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be obvious when you've got the tank
in the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You screw on the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of knobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to open the tank, turn the gas
onto the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to be flowing to the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That regulator has a valve you can turn
that will allow gas to flow through the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lines that attach to the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang those lines high in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hang them right about the height
of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is a gas that is heavier than oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That CO2 is going to pump through those
lines and it will fall right down onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and become available for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we know how much CO2 is in the
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when CO2 gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a CO2 monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a standalone CO2 monitor or
this will work right into the automated
[SPEAKER_00]: system I was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tab for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a CO2 monitor, whether a
standalone unit or unit that's combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with our other monitoring and triggering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your more expensive CO2 monitors will
also have a CO2 controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: These CO2 controllers work very similarly
to the cap controllers I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different brands and
styles available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them will have a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that screen you can set the level that
you want the CO2 to reach in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the more advanced models will also
give you the option to set a schedule so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it comes on only when the lights are
on and it does not come on when the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to add CO2 when the lights
are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to set the level you
want the CO2 to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to set a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this CO2 monitor has a cord hanging
off of it which plugs into the wall or
[SPEAKER_00]: your power source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plug that plugs into the wall has
a piggyback that you can just plug your
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 regulator directly into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that thing is going to monitor the
level of CO2 in the room and when it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity triggered to the CO2 regulator
it will just fire up and let the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator know to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 regulator will pump gas down those
lines that you've got hung above the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy and then once that CO2 regulator
says oh it's enough it'll turn that right
[SPEAKER_00]: off for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the best way in my opinion to
set up CO2 in a small grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very similar to the way it's done
in a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the same lines above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the lines are much longer and of
course we're not running to the grow store
[SPEAKER_00]: to refill our canisters all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a truck that comes and they
actually link up to a giant set of
[SPEAKER_00]: canisters outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about a dozen six foot tall
canisters outside that the truck fills for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lasts about half a week maybe a
little less depending on how many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms are in full flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very similar to the way it's done
in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you don't want to use the CO2
monitor I understand they're expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the regulator on a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do that how do you know how
much CO2 is in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if you even need to add
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if you haven't overdone it
and you're not wasting CO2 at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a CO2 monitor is really worth the
money you're going to spend because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can save on CO2 in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be wasting CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't just be blasting CO2 into the
room and wondering what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like knowing what's happening in my grow
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're big if they're small it's
always better to take good notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what is happening in there
instead of just blasting something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're paying a lot of money for and not
understanding any type of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm paying money for CO2 I would
like to have a CO2 monitor just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of number go up just to see my
money turn into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's just a number on that monitor
I want to see some kind of result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick sidebar on CO2
augmentation and CO2 equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that fit perfectly right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this series of grow lessons is
off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some goals in mind for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to expect from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where to put the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good understanding of what
equipment we need for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to set up our lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to set up our air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand what type of humidifier and
dehumidifier we might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good understanding of how to
set up our CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are off to a really good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode I plan to talk about
selecting the appropriate pots soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that we'll work our way into
integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start wrapping up the show I
really want to thank you guys for

[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a fresh new grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy Tommy dubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode three fifty six of
the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella dank seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella dank seed company and you can find
them at dank seed dot store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start these shows
off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a big fat dab of some coffee
nectar from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is alien Kush and alien OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described as dark roast coffee and
watermelon candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this one on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely does have that coffee
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the lingering aftertaste is a little
bit of coffee with that sweet watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an accurate description there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs and excellent work on the coffee.
Nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be another grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the fifth lesson in a long
series of grow lessons I've got planned
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lesson will be more about selecting
our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point in the grow lessons we
should have a good goal for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good place for our grow
planned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have a good idea of the
equipment that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you should have a good idea of
how to set up all of that gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got a good grow room
running let's talk about pots and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll work our way into our
nutrient options.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to selecting containers for
our plants we've got a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can select net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can select plastic nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there are waffle pots also known as
root pots available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people get various sizes of bags
of soil and cut the top off a bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pack that soil down into the bag
really tight and you can grow your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: directly in there if that's what you want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these methods have their pros and
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to focus on when selecting
your pots is drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pots need holes on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be watering and feeding our
plants a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nowhere for that excess water
to go it's just going to build up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to create a mud puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will drown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots will drown in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need plenty of holes for drainage in
the bottom of our pot no matter what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of pot we select.
[SPEAKER_00]: The net pots I talked about those are
mostly holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nursery pots they should come with
holes already in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fabric pots they provide plenty of
drainage by being a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waffle pot does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys when I'm saying a waffle pot
I mean those air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a waffle maker with a bunch
of holes in it and sometimes it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: rivets that you can undo and you can
unroll the pot and take the root ball out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can manipulate the root ball and
then put the pot back on or you can up pot
[SPEAKER_00]: it at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I mean when I'm saying the
waffle pots they're air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody rolled them out
with a waffle maker and then made a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see those when you go to the grow
store and you go shopping for pots you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use whatever container you've got
available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to go buy a bunch of
five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to recycle some sort
of container that they use frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fine as long as you make some
drainage holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often I start my baby plants whether
seeds or clones in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: When football season starts or during the
Super Bowl those beer cups go on sale
[SPEAKER_00]: super cheap stock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a few bags of beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I stack them up about eight or ten
tall and I use a drill and I take a power
[SPEAKER_00]: drill with the long bit and I poke a hole
right through the bottom of the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to ten cups at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did 20 cups and they've got holes
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got one big drainage hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll also go through and make one or
two more holes on the side of each cup
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got three solid drainage holes in
a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get any root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get stagnant water in
the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way to segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to segue into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need a pot that is the appropriate
size for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start small plants in small pots
either a beer cup maybe a four maybe a six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want to put a little tiny plant
with a little tiny root zone in a big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you put it in a three gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all that extra space in there
for those roots to just swim around in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extra space that you need to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to require more water which
will require more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you're going to have to spread the
plants out more if they're in larger pots
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you may require more light by
keeping them in smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the garden more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps things more cost effective and
it's easier to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start my babies off in a little tiny
pot and when it's time I transplant them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a one or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll finish my plants in that
one or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times I will either skip the three
gallon and go straight into a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot or I'll go from the cup into a three
gallon into a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about deciding which size
pot to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know which size pot to transplant
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all depends on how long that plant is
going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on how big that plant is
going to be in the end of its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you going to age.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pot size will also play a huge factor
into how frequently you need to water your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running little one gallon pots
and you've got semi large plants you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to water every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got semi large plants but you're
running seven or ten gallon pots you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go in dump a bunch of water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave those for two three
sometimes four or five days depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how far into your cycles you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pot size is going to make a huge
difference on how frequently you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the size of the plant
and the size of our container when growing
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest approximately a two to
three gallon pot for every 12 inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a 12 inch tall plant you
want about a two or three gallon pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about your finished plant
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants going to finish about 12
maybe 18 inches tall that's when you want
[SPEAKER_00]: a two or three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll get them about 24 inches
tall in that three gallon pot but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm watering every single day and
they're thirsty at the start of every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants are going to finish
around 12, 18 maybe 24 inches at the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum height then you can go in a two to
three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow bigger plants you need
bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go to like a two foot tall
plant that's when I would definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend three to five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five gallon pot is very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we want bigger plants we obviously
need to move into bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want about a 36 inch to a 42 inch
plant maybe just a little bit bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you need to work with the five
to seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you start going past five feet in
an indoor grow it starts kind of becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: a pain in the ass unless you're in a
commercial grow with Gavitas up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all that ceiling height but a
five or six foot tall plant is really as
[SPEAKER_00]: tall as I would recommend in an indoor
grow unless you're really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to push out a big six foot
monster in the garage or something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when you want to push into a 10 maybe a 12
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to be sure to have enough
root space to support these giant plants
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to select the appropriate container
for the appropriate plant size you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind that you can start small
and you can always up pot that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend up potting during
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's critical you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see you transplant
probably 10 days maybe seven 10 days maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: five days before you put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can if you're good at it and
you're not going to shock the plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can transplant it the day you flip
into flower and you can put it into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that day as long as you don't disrupt
anything as long as you don't piss that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant off you will be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've given it any shock if you're not
experienced with transplanting I would
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly give it a few days to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's not getting transplanted and
triggered into flower and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: life out all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that plant a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about drainage we have
talked about the height and size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the pros and the cons
of small pots versus large pots small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the advantage of using
small containers in our garden with a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need as much water which means
you don't need as much nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to that is you may need to
water more frequently once the plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little larger you may be in there
watering twice a day if your pots are too
[SPEAKER_00]: small for your plant size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of small pots is that
you can fit the plants closer together
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't take up as much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall to that is you don't have as
much space for branching if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: a strain that just does one stick straight
up and doesn't have a lot of side
[SPEAKER_00]: branching maybe smaller pots are ideal
because you can get them closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage to smaller pots are
mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people aren't able bodied some people
need some assistance and large pots may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be ideal for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small pots may be the way to go for
people who aren't physically able to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage a five or seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these plants once these pots are
filled with medium if we're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa if we're going to put soil we're
going to put a soilless mix whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: put in there then you add a plant in there
then you add a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a five gallon pot that's got quite a
bit of weight to it if you're not an able
[SPEAKER_00]: bodied person or if you've got anything
slowing you down that pot may not move it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be stuck right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the advantages of smaller pots
is mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about larger pots as we
work our way into larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have different advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: One advantage of larger pots is less
frequent watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage to that is it takes more
to water at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we've got a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants in about week three of
flower and we've given that plant a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry out a little bit and it's actually
thirsty and it's prime time for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant may take at least a gallon
maybe a gallon and a half possibly two
[SPEAKER_00]: full gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a lot more water to
water that larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not going to need to water it
for probably three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my favorite advantage to running large
seven gallon pots is bigger plants and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to consider when
thinking about pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to think about is how big
will your plant be in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a big enough home for your plant
at its finished size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something to help you kind of think
about pot size is plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado we are strictly limited by the
amount of plants we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how big those plants are
but the number is what they go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere like Colorado with a limited
plant count that's where we start growing
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having a whole bunch of little
plants under one light we just put one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant under a light and veg it for a long
time and then flower that out and we try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get one to two pounds out of one plant
under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant count is a huge factor to keep in
mind when thinking about pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you don't have a plant count your
options are limitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run little four inch by four inch
Rockwell cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put 64 of those on a four by four
tray and you can absolutely pull easily a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound underneath one light with 64 little
plants and very little veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want bigger plants you can do
nine three gallon pots under a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt light or if you want to go bigger
that's when I would start recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: like four seven gallon pots under a
thousand or if you want to go even bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe do one or two ten gallons or maybe
just one 12 gallon pot underneath a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the pros and cons or the
advantages and disadvantages of larger and
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about different types of pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over some of the types of pots
that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net pots are usually available in four or
six inch diameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't very deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only about three or four inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like somebody took a pot and
then just cut a bunch of holes out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it more like a mesh more like a
spaghetti strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to that is that it gets a
lot of airflow so you don't ever overwater
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and you get plenty of wet and
dry cycling and you get a lot of oxygen to
[SPEAKER_00]: your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall with the net pots is being so
small and allowing all that airflow they
[SPEAKER_00]: do require frequent watering once the
plants start building a good root system
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next pots I talked about were our
basic nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the plastic pots we are all
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a lot of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are square.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available in black or white.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors I may recommend
a white pot if it's available in the size
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors I don't think it makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pots are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why they are the industry
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in any size and volume you need
and they're also very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your basic nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to those is they don't dry
out as quickly as a root pot or an air
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have more time between
waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is less root growth and
slower root growth because that restricted
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: More airflow allows more root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows the plants to dry more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a balance there between plastic
pots and fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to segue into fabric
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabric pots are available in many sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them as small as a half gallon
and I've seen them as big as 200 gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the advantages of the
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of airflow to your root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots love airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also helps us prevent over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you do over water that pot's not
going to hold it because it is fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water will just run right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really advantageous with the
large pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your air pots, your fabric pots are going
to dry out much more quickly than a
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic pot because of all that airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest buying a little larger pot
if you're going to run fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run five gallon plastic
pots, consider seven gallon fabric pots
[SPEAKER_00]: for that extra time so that you don't have
to water and your roots are just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow more quickly with those air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend that extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage to fabric pots is faster
growing, more productive roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is you're going to have
to water more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about those air pots or the
waffle pots I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those things all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for the same reason as the
fabric pots because your roots get oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: from all directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about them is they
have got rivets on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's time to up pot your pot,
you don't have to lift that root ball up
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can undo the rivets and that pot
unwraps off of your root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can gently pick that root ball up
and set it into your up pot container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your plant is up potted,
all you have to do is pop the rivets back
[SPEAKER_00]: in and you can reuse that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to destroy it to get the
plant out of there and the plant didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get destroyed to get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is the same as the fabric
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They require more frequent watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a basic breakdown of the three
most common types of pots you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: run into when shopping for pots for your
new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what type of pot you select,
you're going to need something under that
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect the runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you'll need some sort of
saucer or a tray underneath your pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe you're going to put all of your
pots on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about when you water,
that's all going to run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to collect that water somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're running it all off into a
table, it's all got to get to a drain
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just running it into saucers,
you may need to get a shop vac and suck
[SPEAKER_00]: that water out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave those plants sitting in
stagnant water for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically covers the pots and the
part that goes on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking for about 16 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's getting a little dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head's getting a little clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get back, we will talk
about selecting our medium for our new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm taking a couple of dabs,
I'm going to drop in a quick promotion for
[SPEAKER_00]: my Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this podcast because I love cannabis
and because I love helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see you grow the best cannabis
you can grow so you can provide that for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and people that rely on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few costs involved in
producing and hosting a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to help offset those
costs and further my efforts in producing
[SPEAKER_00]: a quality show, you can do so by
contributing to my Patreon campaign.

[SPEAKER_00]: And that's P A T R E O N dot com slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show will always be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you would like to help,
I would truly appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get right back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got all my problems solved and I'm ready
to continue with this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the medium we're going to
select for our new grow medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what's going to go inside of our
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what our plant is going to grow
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to choose soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: A soil is mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to grow in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to cook up a batch of super
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want some living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to do a T L O or a no till
sort of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're just going to grow in rock
wool cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I don't have a lot of
information in this episode for our hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, but I will put together an entire
hydro segment in the future for our
[SPEAKER_00]: waterborne friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, let's talk about soil and
soil list mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will tell you that they
are growing in soil when actually they are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a soil list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the main differences
between soil and a soil list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A soil list mix is right between a soil
and a hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil list mix looks just like soil or
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is there are no nutrients
in a soil list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil list mixes are basically pea or cocoa
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your soil list mixes will have
plenty of aeration added to them like
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite or volcanic rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil list mixes are great because they
give us complete control over what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that leads us right into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference between a soil list
blend and soil is the soil will have
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our store bought soil mixes will
have the same things as a soil list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have the perlite, it will have the
peat moss in there, but it will also
[SPEAKER_00]: contain organically decomposed matter that
make the soil rich in micro and macro
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage to that is that you
don't need to feed your plants as heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: if at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is you don't need to feed
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have control over what you're
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are already nutrients in that medium
and you may not know exactly what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, eventually those nutrients will be
eaten up and you will need to either
[SPEAKER_00]: re-amend that soil or start using bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main difference between soil
and a soil list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are going to go with a soil
list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the soil and soil list mixes
available at your local grow shop will be
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for you to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try not to recommend specific
products and specific brands, but I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make this easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farms Ocean Forest Soil is available
everywhere and it will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to hate me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to love me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what's available to you,
get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Roots Organics makes a quality soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to get lovers and haters
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make this easy for new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a big bale of soil,
it's going to work very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunshine Mix Number 4 is very cost
effective and it is a quality product for
[SPEAKER_00]: a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to stay away from specific
products, but those will work for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and I know they are available at
most reputable grow shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to grow in a soil,
eventually you may need to re-amend that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or start watering with bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go with the soilless mix,
you do need to start feeding nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we'll need to start thinking
about organics or synthetics or boxes or
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that gives us a beautiful segue into
pre-made soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to use bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be more sustainable and they
want to be more organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best options to do that are things
like Super Soil or other living soils or
[SPEAKER_00]: TLO or a no-till setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're using these pre-made soils,
you don't need to add bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything is already in the
medium available to the plant as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about what I mean
by Super Soil or a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to argue with me,
but we're going to put them in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: category for the sake of this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Super Soil or a living soil is exactly
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a soil that is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is filled with microbes and beneficial
fungus and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the macro and micronutrients we
need to get our plant through the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people add a few bonus
items in there, like some volcanic rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust or whatever your secret ingredient
may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a Super Soil, you basically gather all
of your ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I would do it, I would throw a
large tarp on the ground in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix up all of the ingredients
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be bags of a base mix,
which will probably be a soilless mix that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably get from a grow store,
and then a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: will go into a living soil or a Super
Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will get mixed up and put into a
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a little water will be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make everything come to life in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing a little white fungus
on top of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why we call it living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a living soil or a Super Soil idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find plenty of recipes online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google Subcool's Super Soil recipe,
you will find it, I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also go to Build a Soil's website,
and I'm sure they will give you plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: information on building a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me talk briefly about the pros
and cons of a living soil or a Super Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's a lot of ingredients to
gather, but they are affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably more cost effective than
buying a bunch of bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gather your ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to mix them yourself,
which is kind of fun if you're into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into that, it's a giant pain
in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lay out a giant tarp in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weigh out and measure out your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's work to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a specified time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your ingredients,
it needs about 30, maybe 45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs prep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another downfall is a lot of those organic
amendments are not completely reliable on
[SPEAKER_00]: their nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding a bunch of things to a bunch
of other things and cooking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may come out a little richer or a
little lighter than we expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not an experienced grower,
a Super Soil, may throw your plants off
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will have no idea how to adjust
and correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the major downfalls to a
Living Soil for a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix everything properly and you
know how to pay attention to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Living Soil and a Super Soil can do
beautiful things for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you really want to step your game
up, you can go TLO, which means true
[SPEAKER_00]: living organics, or you can go no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have a lot of experience
in either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Sean and Jesse's department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both crush it with the TLO and with
the living organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when you start involving worms
into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the no-till garden, we're never
taking anything to the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically harvesting a plant and
then where the hole from that plant was,
[SPEAKER_00]: we put another plant and then backfill it
with a little bit of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compost that we've made ourselves,
the waste from the plant after we harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes back into our compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reuse almost everything in a no-till
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with a TLO and a no-till
environment, it does take some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare and set up that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing about a no-till,
all of my no-till friends tell me it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: better with every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought everything for the no-till
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set it up one time and they got it
going and they got it dialed in and they
[SPEAKER_00]: grew a crop and those plants came out
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pulled out that root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put that in the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a fresh plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They added some compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They re-amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put some cover crop on the pot and
then it grew in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant grew again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that second crop was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time Frosty was here,
I think he said he was on his seventh run
[SPEAKER_00]: with his no-till crop and it is getting
better every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if every time you grew in the
dirt, it got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: A normal soil or a soil-less mix guy is
either throwing that away or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find some way to recycle it and it's a
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage there of the no-till is
you are recycling all of your grow to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very sustainable and it is 100%
organic if you keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is it takes a lot of time to
set up and it's 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a problem, you have to
research 100% organic methods to correct
[SPEAKER_00]: your issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go to the store, buy a bottle of
something, shake it up, apply it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and think you've solved your
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a no-till environment, it looks like it
takes a little more thinking, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like it is much more rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends that grow the no-till weed,
it really tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pros of the no-till and the TLO
grow is it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that you're going to have a
clean, tasty product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's being self-sustained.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to introduce a bunch of
funky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to keep buying products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no bottles to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside is it takes a little while to
get your medium started before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: even put a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I honestly don't have enough
experience with a super soil, a living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, a TLO or a no-till grow to talk like
I'm an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you the best of my
knowledge from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there is more to think about when
it comes to those types of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more advanced techniques in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've talked about soil and soilless
mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience growing to be
comfortable in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to control everything when it
comes to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to control every nutrient that
goes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the wet and dry time with
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A well aerated cocoa, wet and dry time is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about cocoa, it kind of works
like hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to feed my cocoa grow twice a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pump nutrients through that grow two
times every day, which means those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are really eating heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of tips if you choose cocoa,
make sure you rinse your cocoa before you
[SPEAKER_00]: put your plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where you got your cocoa
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where they got it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where it was stored?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rinse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just fill a pot with it,
if that's what you need to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a giant pot and then just run a
bunch of water through it to where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running the water clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would really be beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're running cocoa,
you may need more cow mag than you're used
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said nothing stays in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the cow mag just falls
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got runoff water, that cow mag
went right on out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hanging out in the medium like it
would if you had soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing for it to hang on to in
the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa doesn't grab it like a soil or
soil-less mix would.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of basic tips if you choose to go
in cocoa would be make sure you rinse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be salty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put your plants in that
salty environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then increase your cow mag and possibly
you may need to increase your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend feeding every day when you're
growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in soil or a soil-less mix,
you may be only feeding once a week or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed every single day in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you water those plants,
put some nutrients in there if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times in the big grow,
we would give them a big watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big feeding to start the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get their whatever else we were
feeding them that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a whole list of stuff we'd feed the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd feed them that early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right before we leave a lot of times,
we would just shoot just a small feed of
[SPEAKER_00]: just base nutrients and cow mag through at
the end of the day just to make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were wet by the time we got there
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really liked being fed twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first time we would feed them a big
fat meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time just base nutrients and
cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit to growing in cocoa is you
get to control all of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle, I don't know if it's a pro
or con, it dries up more quickly than
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to water more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that because that means I get to
feed more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the con to growing in cocoa,
it's not as forgiving as soil or a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's acting more like hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make a mistake, you're going to
see it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffer to fix your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you overfeed in cocoa, those plants
will show you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into the last medium that I
have on my list to talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool are those cubes that you see at
the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look like a giant sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are great for a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to dispose of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very much like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have any nutrients in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not hold any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a very nice wet and dry
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a very large variety of
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them in a one by one cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cut your clone into a little
one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also make them in a four by
four, a six by six, just about any size
[SPEAKER_00]: you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow a huge plant in a small
rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut your clone into a one inch
rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the four by four has a little
spot where that one inch will set right
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the eight inch has a little slot
cut into it where that four by four fits
[SPEAKER_00]: right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just keep up potting just by
setting it on top of another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really saves a lot of work in a large
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably shouldn't forget that they
also offer cocoa in the same types of
[SPEAKER_00]: slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your clone into a small little
cocoa slab and then it fits right into a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, which fits into a larger cocoa
slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for hydro type
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like that is
enough podcasting for one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about selecting containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about selecting your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we will talk about
selecting nutrients for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about it in depth on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that at patreon.com slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate your support there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a fresh new episode, I want to give a
huge shout out to my friend Della Luna
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 357 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show off by letting
you know what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of Fatso 2 live batter
from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of GMO and Legend
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it is described as dark
roast coffee, garlic and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely agree with that
description, but I may add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: underarm and onions to that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a rank after smell to this
that I know it sounds disgusting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is really inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I opened up this concentrate and let
you smell it, you'd go, oh, that is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you dab it, it leaves this
really savory aftertaste that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives me crazy cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a concentrate give me cotton
mouth like that in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got a really nice heavy high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sat me back in the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me just kind of sit here and stare
into the computer screen for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds before I started recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice buzz and I really
enjoy the Fatso 2 live batter from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of information for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the sixth grow lesson
and a long series of lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to talk about
selecting your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new listener, if you're a new
grower, I suggest you head back to episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 351 and start listening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a solid foundation on
setting goals for your grow, selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: your space and selecting your equipment
for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced grower or if
you've been listening, let's get right
[SPEAKER_00]: into selecting nutrients for your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: To grow, selecting nutrients or
fertilizers for your new garden can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be very intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients and fertilizers are the most
heavily advertised product in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you have the gross set up,
your nutrients will probably be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive recurring cost you have in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to guide you on
selecting nutrients without recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: specific brands, without recommending
specific products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to pitch anything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to steer you any specific
direction, but I want to give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea and a good understanding of what to
think about when you are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: customize your garden for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of nutrient companies
out there and countless ways to amend and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little bit of trial and
error to dial in what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to run one nutrient brand
for your first grow and a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different line for your second grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes when you do things like that
and then you can compare what you liked
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one nutrient company will give you
better flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One nutrient company is going to give you
better yields and one will probably give
[SPEAKER_00]: you better potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find the company that does all
three of those and works with your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style, that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the cannabis industry is filled with
egos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody tell you you are
choosing the wrong line because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are satisfied with the
outcome and you are okay with the ethics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the company you are giving your money
to, you can use whatever nutrients you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the beauty of building your own
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the options
when it comes to selecting nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the grow store,
the number one thing they are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pitch to you is bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow stores love to sell bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different types of bottled
nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got salt-based bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your big brand names are salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also organic bottled nutrients
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies boast about having
fully organic wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are vegan options available,
which means there are no animal products
[SPEAKER_00]: in an organic lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we can always do a combination
of organics and synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a nice balance to find
there and make sure that none of our
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic salt-based nutrients are going
to destroy anything in our organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no problem using them
together once you understand that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the pros and
cons of bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A moment ago, I said you can choose
whatever brand you like as long as you are
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with their ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a consumer, it is our responsibility to
understand what the companies we support
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the money we give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't agree with the way a company
operates, if you don't agree with things a
[SPEAKER_00]: company supports, you do not have to shop
with that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to spend your money with a company who
supports cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep your money on our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to spend your money with a company
who is unethical, with a company who is
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly destroying the world, with a
company who is slowly poisoning mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to selecting nutrients,
do a little bit of research about the
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do research about their parent company.
[SPEAKER_00]: See who owns that company and find out
who's at the top of the food chain and see
[SPEAKER_00]: who you're giving your money to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just added a whole new step to
your selection process, but that is my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility is to make you guys think
about stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the ethics of the company
you were spending your money with when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were selecting your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about the pros and
cons of bottled nutrients specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we even get started, I know that
bottled nutrients are not for everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I also know that amended soils and
living soils are not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a living soil guy,
if you're an organic guy, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably already pulling your hair
out saying, Jeff, don't recommend bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: to new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to keep in mind,
not everybody is able to run a no till
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is able to set up a living
soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some people may just want to do
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a chemistry student or your mind
thinks that way, maybe you want a
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring device and a bottle of liquid to
measure and then mix and then balance the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's fun for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're more of a biology student,
you're more into horticulture and more
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to make the preamended
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about doing it your way and what
makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros to bottled nutrients are they are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to a grow store and they are on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Amazon and they are right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major advantages to bottled
nutrients is that they are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage to bottled nutrients is
an available nutrient feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the reputable nutrients companies
have a website that includes a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator or a nutrient feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You type in how many weeks you're going to
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You type in how many weeks are going to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that website makes a custom nutrient
regimen to fit your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week one of veg, it will tell you week
one, feed this nutrient at this rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll say week one, use your base
nutrients at 25 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use CalMag at five mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use whatever else at this many mils per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, week one, it's all right here
listed out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two, what do I need to feed on week
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says 25 mils of this, 10 mils of
this and 10 mils of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll run you all the way through the
growth cycle, all the way up to the time
[SPEAKER_00]: you flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you select a brand, you buy their
lineup, you go to their website,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got basic instructions on how to
mix that brand for optimal results for
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will need to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all plants are the same, but they give
you a pretty good guideline on how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, those companies want you to buy
more bottles more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always reduce the recommended
dosage, maybe 50%, maybe use 75%,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no need to start off at the
whole recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more, you can add more,
but you can never take out once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're burnt, they are burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at maybe 50 to 75% of the
recommended dosage on those schedules and
[SPEAKER_00]: then increase as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you get more experience with the
plants, you will start to see if they need
[SPEAKER_00]: less or more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really handy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nutrient calculator on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learning to grow with bottles can be
very easy because of the accessibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: these websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about bottle nutrients
is easily repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the ratios of each element in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wrote down how much we fed each
nutrient, each feeding time, and we also
[SPEAKER_00]: documented the pH of those feedings,
we should be able to have repeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: results using the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you will need similar environmental
factors in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need the same temperature and the
same humidity and the same VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as nothing changed too
drastically in your grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to repeat your last feeding
schedule and your crop should come out
[SPEAKER_00]: with similar quality to the last harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the pros of working with
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nutrient schedules available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fairly easy to work with and they
are reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some of the cons to
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the cons to working with bottled
nutrients are all related and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have a bunch of plastic bottles
that is environmentally unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are shipping plastic bottles
filled with water across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the nutrients we are buying are 80
to 90% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are basically paying a truck driver
to drive his truck across the country to
[SPEAKER_00]: haul plastic bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once that bottle gets to us,
we have it for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We throw away or recycle that plastic
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recycling center in my area will not
take plastic bottles that had nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot do it, so they have to be
thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside is that we are shipping
plastic bottles filled with water and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we are throwing plastic bottles in a
landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the reasons to not use bottled
nutrients are environmentally based and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the cons to working with
bottled nutrients are environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is,
are you going to know how to grow when
[SPEAKER_00]: those bottles go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow store is to close and society
falls apart and we have to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually farming, are you going to
understand how to farm your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or are you going to be stuck
reaching for bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the organic and the no-till
guys really laugh at the bottle growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the pros and cons of working
with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're shopping for bottled
nutrients, don't be sold by cool packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and fancy logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when it comes to selecting
nutrients, if you're a nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: a new grower, I recommend you stick with
one brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to buy base nutrients from one
company, Cal Mag from another company,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Bloom Booster from another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will lead to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to quickly explain why this
could become problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each company breaks down the required
elements for your plants in different
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles, different packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of these elements can be mixed
together in a bottle and some cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed together in bottles, so they've got
to make two different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies want you to buy 30
different bottles so that you can dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: that mix to have exactly as much nitrogen
as you want, exactly as much phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly as much potassium, while other
companies will mix the nitrogen in one
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle and the phosphorus and potassium in
another bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that because it's easier than
having 30 bottles for your nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each company knows what is in each
product they are putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that if they put out a base and
a Bloom Booster and you use them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know they did not double up on any
specific element in those two bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you grab a base nutrient from one
brand and a Bloom Booster from another
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, they never spoke to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be doubling up and adding too much
of one element to your plants and not even
[SPEAKER_00]: realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I recommend picking one
brand and sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with loyalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has to do with making sure you do
not double up and burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've got one more note about bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to discuss before we move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants require 16 elements for healthy
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants require carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those come from the air and the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen comes from the air and the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, our plants want phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur, boron, chlorine, copper,
iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the necessary elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the nutrients you are buying
have all of those required elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are covering most of your bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would recommend adding an
enzymatic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of enzymes are going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of carbs are going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always recommend some sort of root
love, some sort of beneficial microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some mycos, beneficial fungus,
beneficial bacteria for your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may also need a pKa booster,
a bloom booster later, and flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't need a whole bunch of
unnecessary ingredients for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're getting these 16
elements, maybe some enzymes, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: carbs, and I would always recommend some
sort of a root inoculant, your plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the guy at the grow store sell
you stuff because he works on commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the bottles at the grow store
sell you stuff because they have really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool logos and they're well advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a farm supply store,
everything comes in a white bag with black
[SPEAKER_00]: writing, and it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that fancy labeling and packaging
is just something to charge you extra for,
[SPEAKER_00]: so don't fall for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next part of my note says to
discuss my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to talk too much about specific
brands in here, so I'm not going to go too
[SPEAKER_00]: far in detail, and I may not even say
specific brand names, but you may catch
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started growing, I used a
very popular brand of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are that company that has about 40
bottles available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought all 40 bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun mixing and dialing in
that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that stuff for two or three years,
and I got really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to pull over two pounds from a
normal thousand watt light in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: basement grow, reliably using this
company's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, everything I grew with that
product tasted and smelled and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grew OG Kush and Super Lemon Haze in
the same room with this nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would both smell and look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be a lot of weed, and it would
be really potent, but you could barely
[SPEAKER_00]: tell that I grew two different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I switched to another company that was
known to be their competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company still had quite a few
bottles, but not as many.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this company was not nearly as
expensive as the brand I had tried before,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I started using their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell a few weeks in that I was not
satisfied with that product either.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants were looking colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell a huge difference in each
varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was not going to be the weight
or potency that I had gotten from the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I had to get rid of that
product and move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been doing a lot of research and I'd
fallen in love with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I told you I wasn't going to
talk about a lot of brands, but Botanicare
[SPEAKER_00]: did a really good job for me for a really
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dialed in a beautiful Botanicare recipe
with a couple of additives, and I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best cannabis I have ever
smoked with Botanicare nutrients and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was ecstatic with my results from
Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I noticed something started changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were changing their recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one day they announced that they had
sold their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noticing that the recipe was changing and
that my plants weren't as happy as they
[SPEAKER_00]: had been with that product before already
had me looking into another product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also working in commercial grows and
experimenting with other product lines in
[SPEAKER_00]: those grows, being exposed to commercial
grows and the options to run so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different products on so many different
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what worked and what did not
work for me and the way that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that Botanicare was changing
their recipes and then discovering that
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare had sold their brand to
Hawthorne, who is one of those companies I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke of earlier that we would rather not
support, I had to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been using a powdered nutrient
system in a commercial grow for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: while and I was ecstatic with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also been learning to use another
bottled nutrient system in that grow and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was completely satisfied with their
results as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now over time I realized that the powdered
nutrient company was lacking just a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that I could probably boost up
my production if I added a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a couple of products from that
bottled nutrient line and added those to
[SPEAKER_00]: my powdered nutrient line and by using two
different nutrient companies I have
[SPEAKER_00]: created a stellar nutrient program for my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I did say that I would
recommend you stick to one brand but once
[SPEAKER_00]: you learn the plants and you learn about
the nutrients you'll be able to customize
[SPEAKER_00]: your mix to as many brands as you like as
long as you understand what's in each
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been trying to avoid giving you
brand names and specific product names but
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know I'm going to get a bunch of
emails if I don't tell you what I use so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to spill the beans and tell
you that I use Veg Bloom powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients as my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Veg Bloom HD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use Plus Life and when we get into
flour I start adding two grams of Shine
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as we get later into flour I will
increase the Shine that's very strain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten up to four grams of Shine per
gallon on some strains and they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the Veg Bloom mix I also add a little
bit of New Millennium products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the Ruby, the fulvic acid from New
Millennium and I also use the Carbonaria,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbs from New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm adding a little fulvic acid to
increase uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding a little bit of carbs to give
more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also add SLF 100 enzymes and if the
plants show me that they need more Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: we use Cali Magic from GH in a commercial
facility and that is basically my nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule for a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright that's my rant on bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about amended soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about living soil and we'll
kind of touch on no-till environments as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have as much experience in this
realm so I will not have as many details
[SPEAKER_00]: for you but I'm sure that I'll be able to
give you a good enough breakdown to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you make your decision and selecting your
nutrient or your fertilizing style for
[SPEAKER_00]: your new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about what I
mean by living soils and super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more natural, more sustainable
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your super soil can be as simple or as
elaborate as you want to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of recipes for usable
super soils online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making your own living soil can be very
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are basically combining dried
amendments with soil or soilless mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it the proper conditions and time
to cook and become alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I would do it is throw a large
tarp on the garage floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put out the amount of soil that I
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add all the dried amendments on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use a shovel and or a pitchfork to
stir that up real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it's all mixed up you add it to
a trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to add a little bit of
moisture to your new concoction just to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put the lid on the trash can and
store it in a warm area and wait about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days over time all of those amendments
will start breaking down in that soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will create a living environment in
that trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take the lid off of that trash
can if you see a white layer of moldy funk
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the dirt that is exactly what we
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have created living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have basically mimicked what Mother
Nature does inside of a small container
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are giving the plants exactly what
they would want without force feeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that they do not want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now depending on the mineral content of
your newly made soil you may need to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of uncharged soil to your pots
when you are putting new plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: because that fresh soil may be a little
too potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a little too rich and you may
need to cut it down to reduce burning your
[SPEAKER_00]: new baby plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about when
working with the living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the pros
and cons of a living soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main, the best part is that it is
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everything you put in there is
organic you have got an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those dried amendments come in a
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That box is either compostable or
recyclable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there is not a bunch of water in that
box to ship around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are getting the product,
the product goes into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the box goes into recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very minimal waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those meals are actually waste
products that we are reusing so we are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually recycling and putting away waste
product to use by putting it in our
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge advantage of living soil
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also when you start running a living soil
or an organic garden you will also
[SPEAKER_00]: probably end up creating a compost bin in
your home which will also create more
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental awareness which will just
cause a chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start growing organically you
will start seeing things on a more organic
[SPEAKER_00]: level in your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will affect your eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will affect your shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will start thinking about the earth
differently as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the benefits and also
some of the side effects of growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start working in like a no-till
environment another huge advantage is very
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to no-till there is
essentially no waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a no-till environment you harvest a
plant, you hang the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets trimmed and dried and cured and
consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waste goes back into your compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pod where we just cut that plant out
of we are going to gently cut the root
[SPEAKER_00]: ball out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that big root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to put another clone in
that spot and we're going to backfill that
[SPEAKER_00]: with composted dirt that we've got in our
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got a fresh plant ready to
go with zero waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge advantage to a no-till
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: People growing cocoa or growing soil
they've got to figure out how to either
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle or get rid of all of that cocoa or
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got more than four or five
three gallon pots worth of used cocoa or
[SPEAKER_00]: soil it becomes a challenge to try to get
rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just dump it in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to notice that big fresh
pile of dirt with a bunch of perlite in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they're going to say perlite
what's he doing and it's going to just
[SPEAKER_00]: start triggering things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's hugely advantageous to not have
any waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to no-till gardening another
huge advantage is there are minimal bug
[SPEAKER_00]: threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like when you establish a no-till
garden it comes right along with
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do introduce any spider mites
or unwanted pests those beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: are already there and they'll creep in and
destroy the population before it gets out
[SPEAKER_00]: of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a good thing with a
no-till garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Frosty was on the show a while
back and he was talking about going hiking
[SPEAKER_00]: and then walking right into his no-till
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said bro don't you kind of worry
about maybe gathering a spider mite on
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoe and taking spider mites into
that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said bro that's just food for the
predator mites that are already in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the no-till guys seem to be fairly
confident in their pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the major advantages to a
living soil or an organic system are it is
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everything you put in there is
organic you know that everything comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow shop burns down, if Amazon
shuts down, if you learn how to grow like
[SPEAKER_00]: a farmer, when the shit hits the fan
you'll be one of the few people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your own food and growing herb for
us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes right along with what I call
a side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start becoming more aware of what
you're doing to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go grocery shopping you'll find
yourself in the produce section trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy more things that have something you
can add to your compost bin after you eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will totally affect the way you
shop, the way you eat, and the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you head into the no-till range
another huge advantage is minimal waste
[SPEAKER_00]: and very minimal pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once we've got our living soil
established and we've got our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: going, if we do notice some sort of a
deficiency there are ways that we can add
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to our organic system without
introducing bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to brew up a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean and Jesse have talked about compost
teas a lot on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go too deep into making a
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically throw amendments in a bucket
and add an aerator and you let it bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: for a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then depending on the strength of the tea
and the type of tea we made we either
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute it or we water it directly into the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everything you used to make
your tea was organic your grow is still
[SPEAKER_00]: fully organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option for adding nutrients to a
slowing organic garden is to top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can place organic amendments on top of
the soil and water them in just like you
[SPEAKER_00]: would a bottled nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not work as rapidly as it would
when using bottled nutrients because you
[SPEAKER_00]: will need time for the organic amendments
to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But top dressing is certainly a way to add
nutrients to an organic living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: without introducing bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've set up a living soil or a
super soil and you see those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: slowing down or if you see those plants
are showing you some type of deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to brew up a compost
tea or top dress with the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment to add the missing element that
those plants will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things I have heard Jesse and Sean talk
about top dressing quite often are fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, kelp meal, alfalfa, and comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now before I get myself too far off
track let's talk about some of the cons of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with a living soil or a super soil
type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside is the mix work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a space to mix this,
if you don't have a space to cook the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, it might not be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a lot of space to create this
soil, then it does take a trash can worth
[SPEAKER_00]: of space to store this soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that leads me right into the next part
which is the cook time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you decided you want to start a
garden and you're going to start it next
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least 30 days to brew up a
batch of super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are already running late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the downside is the cook time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to let it cook and come alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another disadvantage to working with a
super soil or a living soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the richness of the soil you
just made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that soil too hot for little plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be okay for little plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: A new grower may not have the eye to see
if those plants are having problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't know how to identify it and
they won't know how to prevent or correct
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue if they see it in a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another disadvantage to working with a
living soil is if you do have a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, you are very limited on approaches
for eradicating your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to stick to organic options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a soil pest problem,
your options are very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said earlier, you shouldn't
encounter too many problems in an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: soil environment because we've got enough
microorganisms there to keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: check.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do end up with a root problem,
you are very limited on ways you can
[SPEAKER_00]: treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot treat your living soil with a
root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were running a soil garden and you
were feeding with bottled nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: you ran into a root problem, like a root
pest, you would be able to do a root
[SPEAKER_00]: drench with a pesticide, either Botanogard
Max or Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mix up 15 to 30 mls per gallon
and you water that right in with your
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will eradicate any soil borne
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go feeding Botanogard Max or
Evergreen to a living soil situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we basically destroy the entire
environment we worked to create in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something to keep in mind when
you are thinking about your nutrient and
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be able to implement your
integrated pest management system with
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient and soil selections?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all got to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are basically the pros and cons
of working with a living organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you've got an organic,
sustainable garden that should feel good
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real disadvantage that I can
think of when it comes to growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil or an organic type environment
is that it takes a lot of work ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work that has to happen
before you start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that work ahead may be exactly what
some people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're one of the people that enjoy
the smell of that rich dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the guy that enjoys mixing
all those amendments together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like having worm castings under
your fingernails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're into brewing your own compost
teas or waiting for your own fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: plant juices to ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what makes you happy with
your growth style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's all about your abilities and
what is available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a big city, maybe some of
those organic amendments won't be as
[SPEAKER_00]: available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a small city, a small farm
area, you'll have access to all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs, but you may not have
access to bottles and a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may come down to what's available in
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, most of us do have access to Amazon,
but not everybody can afford everything on
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust to your budget as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point of your garden is to
produce a product that makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are happy with your garden,
as long as you're having fun, as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're enjoying yourself, and as long as
you are getting a product at the end that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you happy, you are doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set up a grow that you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the scientist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be in there with a couple
of measuring devices and bottles and
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring out 15 mils of this and pour it
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's measure out 35 mils of this and
pour it in and mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's test the PPMs, see what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that looks real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you that guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you the guy that wants to mix up
everything at the beginning and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: add water and then just watch the plants
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the guy that wants to brew up
a bunch of teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're that guy making the fermented
plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be the scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are happy with your garden,
that's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are many more ways to feed your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are many more nutrient
styles and fertilizing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not experienced in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't teach you about aquaponics,
but I feel like we would be leaving out
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our friends at the Growing with
Fish's podcast if I didn't at least
[SPEAKER_00]: mention aquaponics as a very viable and
sustainable way of fertilizing your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Growing
with Fish's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it fascinating, but I do not have
any experience, so I can't teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my podcast about selecting
nutrients and fertilizers for your new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the most important part is that
you are having fun and that you are happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with what comes out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also try to keep in mind the ethics of
whoever you are giving your money to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to shop with people who support our
community and our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I left anything out or if you've got
anything you'd like to add, I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to reach out if you feel
like I missed something or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something you'd like to add.
