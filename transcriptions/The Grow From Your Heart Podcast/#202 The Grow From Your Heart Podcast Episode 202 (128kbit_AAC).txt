[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back with another chunk of old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This time, we're doing episodes 28,
29, 30, and 31 of what used to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: iGrowCulture podcast, now known as the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get into these old episodes,
let me make the disclaimers I like to
[SPEAKER_05]: make.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've learned a lot in 200 episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been about three years,
which means I've learned a lot about
[SPEAKER_05]: growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've learned a lot about podcasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've learned a lot about life.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I say something in these episodes that
I have contradicted myself with,
[SPEAKER_05]: just keep in mind that shit changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an ever-changing industry,
an ever-changing project.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will always be changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I do a podcast and do not write
a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may say some things that have been
updated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may contradict myself over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't hold it against me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, all the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the show has changed from the
iGrowCulture podcast to the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart podcast, I changed all the social
media.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Twitter is now at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Facebook is the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The email is now
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to reach out, those are your
options.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The easiest way to get in touch with me,
of course, is by sending me an email to
[SPEAKER_05]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's all I've got for the start
of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without making this file too long,
let's get into episodes 28, 29,
[SPEAKER_05]: 30, and 31 of what used to be known as the
iGrowCulture podcast, now known as the
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to episode number 28 of the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call me Rasta Jeff, and I'll be your
captain for this adventure.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this episode, Spencer and Jesse came
back, and they brought our friend Michael,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we have a talk about phenohunting,
but we got really dabbed out, so I
[SPEAKER_05]: apologize if we were too high to be
useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, we sparked some questions,
so please send those questions to me via
[SPEAKER_05]: email, Twitter, or Facebook, and I'll
answer them on an upcoming show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the email address is
iGrowCultureathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find me on Twitter under at
iGrowCulture, or on Facebook, just search
[SPEAKER_05]: for iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got three ways to get in touch with
us, so please send me your questions about
[SPEAKER_05]: phenohunting or anything else you'd like
to hear about on the show, and I will talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about it on a future episode.

[SPEAKER_05]: I've got Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got Spence back on the mic and we got
a new guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Michael on the microphone with us

[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a Twitter name or something
people can look for and find you on or on
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram so they can check you out while
they're listening to the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Colorado Bearded Dabbers on

[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado Bearded Dabbers in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: What up?
[SPEAKER_05]: What up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to the whole CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody here is a pretty experienced
grower, so everyone will have a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: input.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should explain what a phenotype is.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing, I'll take one step back,
we will explain a genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: The offspring of two parents will make
genetics and that genetic makeup is the
[SPEAKER_05]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of that genotype, there will be
various phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best way I can think of to compare it
would be when your parents make kids,
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't all look the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your dad's probably tall, your mom's
probably a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them's got blonde hair,
one of them's got dark hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they make kids, sometimes they come
out with kids with blonde hair,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes they come out with kids with
dark hair, sometimes they come out blue
[SPEAKER_05]: eyed, sometimes they come out brown eyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants are going to do the same thing and
that's to be expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are ways to minimize those traits or
bring out traits that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_05]: but for the most part, when you're making
seeds in the beginning, the seeds that
[SPEAKER_05]: most of you guys are able to get your
hands on, what a lot of the breeders are
[SPEAKER_05]: selling you are going to be F1s,
F2s or F3s.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are very few breeders going further
than F4.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one guy I know that brags about
F5, which is really cool, really
[SPEAKER_05]: respectable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just talked a lot, I feel like there's a
lot of echo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I talked a lot about variation
in phenotypes and a lot of F1 and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: In F1, when you take two plants,
a male and a female plant, those are now
[SPEAKER_05]: your P1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you breed them, the seeds that come
out of that are F1.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have a lot of variety
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some stuff is going to look like mom,
some stuff is going to kind of look like
[SPEAKER_05]: the dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get a lot of switch and
then you're going to get stuff way in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle between the mom and the dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get that perfect hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of times the one that
everybody's looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a little further, you'll make an F2.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you find a sweet male and a sweet
female out of those F1s and you breed
[SPEAKER_05]: those together, you're going to make an
F2.
[SPEAKER_05]: F2 is where you come up with something
that we call transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which means, and Jesse smiled when I
mentioned this pre-show, transgressive
[SPEAKER_05]: segregation is when your actual progeny,
which is your offspring, outperforms the
[SPEAKER_05]: parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take two seeds, a male and a
female, and you cross them and that plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that comes out is way more badass than the
parents you have just experienced
[SPEAKER_05]: transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The F2 level is where you really want to
buy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: If a breeder is selling those seeds,
a lot of us don't really let you know what
[SPEAKER_05]: we're giving you, what HF level,
how far it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of breeding secrets,
but those F2s are awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can get a hold of those,
that's where a lot of cool shit happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to kind of back up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The variation, a lot of us at the table
seem to love the variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do what is called a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: We buy a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You grow that whole pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not going to breed, you
eliminate the females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you've got- Not always.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching my back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to pull those males and then you
keep it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to catch my breath also.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep the females going.
[SPEAKER_05]: You try to find the good ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look for the traits that those are
putting off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Early on, you could tell structure,
speed of growth, vigor, leaf size.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could tell kind of if you got a more
indica or sativa leaning phenotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: Node spacing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Node spacing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people like to kind of jerk the
stem a little bit and smell that,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they think that that's going to lead
to a lot of what it's going to really
[SPEAKER_05]: smell like in the end.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you look for?
[SPEAKER_13]: I like smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's really important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Node spacing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_13]: Early resin production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Early resin production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to see that resin about day
30, 25-ish, getting frosty?
[SPEAKER_13]: If things are going real well,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about yourself over there,
new guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want it louder or quieter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's just this thing over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about this headphone thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually looking for usually a shorter,
stockier plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shorter, stocky plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually like more indica plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm usually looking for a
shorter, stockier plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't like when they wave around
too much, because usually when they start
[SPEAKER_02]: stacking, they're going to need to be
staked up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a plant that kind of supports
itself a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, Spence?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I grow seeds, you can usually
figure out whether or not your plant's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be ... Well, depending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I grow plants under a scrog net,
so the lengthier plants you'll get will be
[SPEAKER_03]: better for a scrog net, in my opinion,
and then your shorter, stockier plants
[SPEAKER_03]: will be your just freestanding plants that
you can stake down and don't have to give
[SPEAKER_03]: too much support besides that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But vigor, smells, and then I look for ...
Especially if I know what it's coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from, you can look at your leaf sets and
see if they start matching parents and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can know which parent you've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said something sort of interesting
that leads me to another point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing the feno hunt, running a pack of
seeds and looking for that feno that you
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of these guys grow different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody in this room grows a different
style.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence does the scrog net.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do any scrogging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to run a seven gallon pot,
so those plants you guys are worried about
[SPEAKER_05]: waving around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a tomato cage on those early on
in life, so they're not going to get me
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that stretchy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not stretchy, but I mean, with some
height to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, hey, look, that's what ... I
just got to tuck into my damn mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't make love to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it up out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds a lot better that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always tell everyone, get up on the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one over here, nowhere near the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get punk with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't want my teeth on that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that punk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some days you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw you after your wedding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Burn, thanks for taking good care of
me at the hydro shop the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn was working and she treated me well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: The store looks great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one big empty spot now where I was
shopping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be refilled.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it already is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about phenotypes and
variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people get angry about variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Spence said to talk about S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: We skipped S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: S1 is when ... I do a lot of S1s.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a feminized seed, essentially,
or usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I take my grateful dog, two grateful
dog clones of the same plant, reverse one,
[SPEAKER_05]: throw that pollen on the other one in
flower, those seeds are not a new ... It's
[SPEAKER_05]: not a new breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've selfed it and made seeds of that same
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find that those ... A lot of people hate
on feminized seeds, but if an S1 is done
[SPEAKER_05]: properly, and I want to hear your guys'
opinions because you've been growing my
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds a little bit, do the S1s seem to
mirror their parents a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: than the regular ... I definitely think
S1s ...
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what it was, but it came
out so different, but so much like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: one of its original parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the Capelton?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might have been the Capelton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I gave you a bunch of Capelton
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell everybody that Spence is
actually who threw down that white widow
[SPEAKER_05]: female that I use in the Capelton cross,
so shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've contributed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him the first handful of seeds I
made out of that to run for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to say thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that in the pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see the grateful dog, but then if
you knew that it was that white widow,
[SPEAKER_05]: mom, you could see her in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could definitely see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got buddies running it now,
and I can look at them from four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks after they've been planted,
and you can see in the structure and then
[SPEAKER_03]: in the leaf sets what parent it's related
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not related to, but closest to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leaning toward.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can almost tell them, keep that one,
pull that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting good with it, but the shit
I've bred, I'm getting really good with
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Vigorlover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vigorlover is growing shit out of some
Capelton like a boss.
[SPEAKER_05]: He makes dank water hash and grows that
strain like a bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for doing my seeds justice.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is your experience with S2s?
[SPEAKER_13]: Compared to, say, F2, if you don't mind
answering.
[SPEAKER_05]: The S1s come out, I would say 50% of them
look like mommy, and then the other 50 are
[SPEAKER_05]: a little weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's odd to say for a
breeder, but you get mutants and shit when
[SPEAKER_05]: you do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cousin fucking, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really, but I know I'm not
supposed to say that word on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's no better way to put that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cousin fucking.
[SPEAKER_05]: S2s come out even more uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say maybe 70% more uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the mathematician and I didn't
keep good enough notes, I guess,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're even more uniform once you get
into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize I was doing something
unique when I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took the same grateful dog, the original
female, and kept taking a clone and using
[SPEAKER_05]: that reversed female to make seeds again
and then making another generation almost
[SPEAKER_05]: inbreeding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten it so far that those come out
like clones, those grateful dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: The S4 generation, I think, is kind of
what it would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know a lot of people that have
done it, so I don't know how to label it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's S4.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those have come out, they're like clones
of each other, growing seeds from clone,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is kind of nice for a breeder to
achieve, and a feminine seed, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those aren't out on the market yet,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what you're getting yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't made enough of them to check,
but you guys will get them eventually.
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet those will be very popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know anybody that's gotten them
that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always find weird shit in the nice
seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I ask, because I don't think
I've ever grown an S2 that I know of.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've grown up to F3 or F4.
[SPEAKER_05]: How far have you made, if you don't mind
me asking?
[SPEAKER_13]: BX3.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm at the point I don't know if I want to
back cross it one more time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm pretty happy with what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if I want to start in-crossing it and
start making, I guess it'd be a F1,
[SPEAKER_13]: F2 generation, and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: What percentage of those seeds now are
coming out to be what you have in mind?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two different phenotypes,
and I really like them both.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you got two, you can identify
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: There were some less desirable phenotypes,
and I worked them out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe on the BX2 generation when I
made the threes.
[SPEAKER_13]: The one phenotype I call One Night Stand,
and it's a hazy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was shaking my head going, why didn't I
write that down one day?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, damn, he just killed him.
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_13]: Then the other one is just the Depot Dog,
and it's real.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a Kim Dog stabilization project.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot like Kim D.
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit like Diesel, a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_13]: More unique thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or not unique, but different thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Slightly different than Kim D,
but a lot like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, we're throwing around a lot of crazy
terms here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my bad or our bad for kind of
fucking yell up, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We inspire them to learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're lost, Google it if you want to,
or just keep listening, and eventually
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll fill you in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may not be this episode, but all the
stuff that we're saying will sound like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll sound like us in just a few months
if you keep listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And to other people, and reading books,
and experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your favorite girl book?
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the roots of everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the first one I ever read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a reliable book you go to,
Michael?
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite one, I don't really go to it
as much anymore, but was True Living
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: T.L.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: is my pick up book if I need to go search
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not hitting the internet,
I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That book's pretty reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys need help building soil,
yeah, it's a great book.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about, Jesse and I talk a lot
about soil building on our outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if we go too fast, if you want
more specifics, that book will fill you
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll teach you a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: For myself, I like the Ed Rosenthal
Oakster Dam course guide because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: thorough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got bug explanations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got all kinds of, if I have a
problem, that's the first book I go to.
[SPEAKER_05]: If one of you guys is like, hey bro,
and I don't know the answer, I go get that
book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that one and read it and act like I
know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that available to the public?
[SPEAKER_13]: That is available to the public.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never read that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Between that one and Jorge's book,
you can cover just about everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jorge's book's great too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say it's outdated, but it feels,
it's like your dad wrote it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like that generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_13]: So is the Mel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Man, I don't feel like Mel Franks is the
dude to write.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Robert Connell Clark is what I think
you're thinking of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana Botany?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, not that far back.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, this one was written early 80s.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the title is How to Grow, or in the
first chapter, it's How to Grow a Million
[SPEAKER_13]: Pounds of Skunk Weed or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're talking about pounds,
UK pounds.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mel Thomas, I keep wanting to say.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Googler has had a breach right now,
so we'll just keep the conversation
[SPEAKER_05]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite at this point in my life is
Google.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got to sort through a lot of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you learn where the reliable sources
are.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you see one of their articles pop
up, you know, and most of the time,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they're probably referencing all
these great books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guys, if you read some stuff on
Google, read three or four articles on
[SPEAKER_05]: Google.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go smoke a fat joint and call one of your
grower friends or Twitter somebody here on
[SPEAKER_05]: the show and say, Hey, I just got this
high idea and I want to try this crazy
[SPEAKER_05]: shit to my plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of us on the show, usually we're
pretty friendly folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you catch us at the right time,
we'll answer your emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes me a minute, y'all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Grow Culture at Hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Grow Culture on Instagram and of course
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to message me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to the iRegenetics Colorado
website and go to the forum, create an
[SPEAKER_05]: account, log in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I make it a point to answer those
questions there personally, because that
[SPEAKER_05]: is my forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel responsible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So log in there, create an account.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll answer all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not, my buddy Tony, or Cut Proof,
or Goodroll, or somebody in there will
[SPEAKER_05]: help you out really soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good way to learn a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Be leery of information from a lot of
forums, especially.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to say any names,
but there's two specific ones that are-
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been banned from two forums for
talking shit about people saying the wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: shit on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ban me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to do stuff wrong and I
say, that's bullshit and you ban me,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're supporting bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ban me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to play anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't need to shut up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I read geneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one, I really want to say its
name, but I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it look like this?
[SPEAKER_05]: The ban motion that I'm making?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm banned from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am banned the fuck from that website.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you're twisting a joint.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So phenotypes, I should mention- I'm going
to turn the music down just a touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm yelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: The phenotypes, just to make you guys a
little familiar, Girl Scout Cookies is a
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two known phenotypes of Girl
Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody in the room is shaking their
head.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forum cut that everybody has, and then
there's the platinum cut that I guess not
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody has that they brag about having
in Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there more?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think there may be more,
but- There are more, but those are the-
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's why- The thin-mit cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the thin-mit cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: See?
[SPEAKER_13]: The OGKB.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a hybrid or is that the same- No,
it's not a cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a phenome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a phenome of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the funky, crazy looking one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've ever seen pictures of somebody
saying Girl Scout, OGKB.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, isn't platinum cookies a- Isn't
that a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: What about animal cookies?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hybrid.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a little bit of Girl Scout
Cookies hidden away over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jilly bean is something super popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: You always hear about that candy store
phenome and the orange phenome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Chernobyl, the golden ticket
phenome.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you grow my golden goat from seed,
you're looking for that golden goat
[SPEAKER_05]: phenome that looks just like mommy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plush berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a black cherry kim phenotype,
and then there's the space gleam dominant
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: That black cherry kim, or no, black cherry
soda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, black cherry kim.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black cherry soda, the phenotype that's
dominant to that is very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll know if you've got it about 20 days
into flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn off the grow lights and turn on the
normal lights and look from the underside
[SPEAKER_05]: of the calyx, and you'll see the purple
for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I do get that- Flo's got a couple
known phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Shortz, Flo.
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Shortz said that he put that flow out,
that he released that clone that's in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he let that out to show everybody
what was possible with those seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: what the potential of Flo was.
[SPEAKER_05]: That cut that we all have supposedly came
from DJ Shortz.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out DJ Shortz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have learned a lot of stuff from DJ
Shortz.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that he's doing the free week show
a lot more.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_13]: The new episode's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, listen to that one, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll hear a lot of the ... I've learned
a lot from just listening to DJ on that
[SPEAKER_05]: show, and it's great to hear that he's not
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually ... We all thought he was
from Canada for so many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a boot time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not touching that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't make fun of anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got something to say, Spence?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all leaned up on the mic like
you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand on the trigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to read your question so I can
think of some shit to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you grow out of a pack, this is why
is variation happening and useful?
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about why it's happening because
we're breeding a male and a female,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're making babies, and we don't
want all the babies to look the same in
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how plants survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you find that variation to be
useful?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want that stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want variation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Different phenos?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different phenos gives you ... We talked
about on a previous episode, we talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about how many phenos you should keep in a
seed pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you would want to keep a
couple of different ones, especially if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a seed pack that is a hybrid,
something like that where you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple variations of your parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy the different variations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants grow faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants have more side branching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants grow straight up, and some
plants, the bottoms grow almost as good as
[SPEAKER_03]: the top does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the type of plants certain
people look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need stuff that clones well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And clones well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking like, my clone game's coming
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coming strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think they did something to the
water around here or something because
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's clones, everybody that I know
in this circle of growers was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, my clones, bro, my clones,
bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've lost trays of clones, small trays.
[SPEAKER_05]: My game's back on like Spence said,
but for a minute there, there were some
[SPEAKER_05]: clone issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all calling each other like,
yeah, you got some clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all getting back on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: It had to be something in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something in the water.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like every year this happens
about this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also if you guys are indoor growers in
Colorado, be prepared to be fucked for a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of months because nobody's going to
want to buy your product because I've seen
[SPEAKER_05]: an outdoor crop in every other yard in
Colorado in the past few weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been sunny and everyone's out playing
with their trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good luck, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dispensaries are going to slow down a
little.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I haven't thought that
would happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw a dispensary the other day with a
really big outdoor grow looking pretty
[SPEAKER_13]: nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've seen some pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That thing looks pretty damn killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a really neat greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of really cool fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked about that place on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody's gone by and taken cool
pictures of that greenhouse I talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about, tweet me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw it the night of Jesse's wedding and
it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: How often do you get to do a fino hunt,
bro?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not as often as I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I could grow from seed every single
time, but I have some other plants I have
[SPEAKER_13]: to maintain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the best way to do that is clone and
run clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps reliable medicine for the
patients and that's what we all need.
[SPEAKER_13]: This winter I'm planning on growing pretty
much exclusively seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than just mother maintenance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever ran a whole pack of seeds
and not gotten anything worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your shop's got a nice amount of seeds
going right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you've got high hopes for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of different ones going on
in there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't find a couple of keepers of
each one, it's going to feel like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: work for nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already it's looking like there's a couple
that are setting themselves apart from the
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty promising.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many days in are those?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in veg still.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're on day 23 in veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look good in your pictures on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check them out guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks great on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got some stylish glass and some
stylish plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he takes the biggest dives.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put the gigantic dab thing to
a rest for myself because I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how you feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a little bit of effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do it in the mid afternoon and you
don't plan it right, you can ruin your
[SPEAKER_05]: whole day.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only so many times you can do a
gram dab and survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I actually said was that my
lungs, I've realized my lungs have so many
[SPEAKER_05]: inhales and exhales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think taking a gram dab,
it's just like you're just using up cat
[SPEAKER_05]: lives when you do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was 32 breaths you could have had,
but instead you smoked a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you're going to waste 32 breaths.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't waste any breaths.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially that many.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I mean, which better way to do it than
taking a hit of hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: At least you weren't breathing in concrete
dust or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely prefer the dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: While that music got really loud for a
second, that might've been my fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys want to give a shout out to
this hash that we're hitting here?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good work, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Off the haline honey hole even.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Spence for bringing the
haline honey hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was on point.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This conversation has gotten off track
because I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we want to talk about about
phenotypes, you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is order bag seeds considered?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like seeds you find in like- Mostly yes
ones, I would say.
[SPEAKER_13]: You would say they're considered S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you don't know the parent,
yeah, it's probably just an S1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know the parent if you get the
seeds out of them, but you don't know what
[SPEAKER_03]: the male was sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard of plants like-
Slightly herming?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, slightly herming and seeding the
plant and then taking the seed from there
[SPEAKER_03]: and growing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would that be?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how Soma, sorry Soma, I'm spilling
your beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how Soma actually makes feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He takes a female and flowers her for too
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after she goes, like if you got a
nine week strain, he lets it go for 13 and
[SPEAKER_05]: about week 13, it'll start spitting out
pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he gathers that and throws it on
the next crop that he makes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he says he can smoke those buds too
because he can cut down most of the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: and just leave enough of it to herm out
and spit out pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he can smoke the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you can't smoke it, you can
definitely probably extract it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you heard of his fire technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Heat stress to pick the plants out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little weird to me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I understand the theory where he's
coming from with the forest fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: His method is more organic than mine.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to smoke the flowers of the
plants that I have reversed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to smoke those.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can smoke his.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to smoke mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I would.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't encourage it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been sprayed with chemicals that I
don't trust smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: ChemDog was bag seed guys, so don't ever
doubt bag seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some great bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some crazy looking stuff from bag
seeds and done whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could be an F2.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could experience transgressive
segregation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could outperform its parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will because you don't know what the
parents were.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can outperform them.
[SPEAKER_13]: The person who was managing the room could
have a good idea what the parents were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people on Instagram sell packs
of S1s for $100.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of those forum sites I saw a pack of
S1s go for $8,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some old seeds go for ridiculous
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some OG Rascal stuff in a forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went for a really high price recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went to Cali, I met up with another
person through Instagram and they had the
[SPEAKER_03]: original fire OG cut from Rascal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said it was 20 Gs is how much it
cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an expensive clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's an expensive clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you dabbing over there,
Buster?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have it, it's worth it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a little bit of lemon cookies
from JP Wellness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemon cookies, full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to JP Wellness.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear a lot of good things about that
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Spence, you're ringing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cancel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you're up in the springs,
check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got pretty good extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to cut that out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that's a torch, you guys,
if you're wondering.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for me to take a dab,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take a sip of something and
take a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody got anything snazzy to say?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheers to good weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Snazzy weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got anything longer to say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you working on any breeding projects
right now, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got going on in your project?
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I was saying, I'm really happy with
BX3 of Depot Dog.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think I'm going to make a whole bunch
of seed of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe get it to the public, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a way you can make that happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell them what the cross is on the Depot
Dog again so they can get them excited.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an old school Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really have a whole lot of
heritage on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know the producer of it,
but it was a Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it was a freebie from an old
Amsterdam seed pack.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it had really, really early resin
production.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the initial reason I used it in the
cross was he was very different than Kim
[SPEAKER_13]: D.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was very easy to spot out the
phenotypes that were leaning harder
[SPEAKER_13]: towards him.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I kind of used it as a tool to make the
Kim line more pure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad that Kim was discovered.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody out there that's got a killer Kim
or Kim for Kim D for Jesse?
[SPEAKER_13]: We can trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Colorado and you're an adult,
we can do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can find some seeds or something
for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got a pretty cool Girl Scout cookies
cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be more thirsty for that cookie still.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got the Gorilla Glue 4 and I've got
Platinum OG, so let's talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if ours are the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are Gorilla Glue's?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we should trade cuts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's different phenotypes of
that, isn't there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a more sour, diesel-y one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's one that has more of that
chocolate tie that's in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Girl Scout?
[SPEAKER_13]: Girl Glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've moved on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should make Girl Glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should breed those bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Scout Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, let me think about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's like a Bug Sour or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's Sourdub Chocolate Tie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chocolate Tie.
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds tasty.
[SPEAKER_13]: Something else.
[SPEAKER_13]: And very lanky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can already tell in bench that
those bitches are lanky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those clothes are taller than
everybody else already.
[SPEAKER_13]: The ones I've seen, pretty easy to point
out.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're real bushy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess bushy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bushy lankiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow with more vigor than a lot of
the others.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of like a rose plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got a text coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's phone is not really advanced,
is the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be an antique.
[SPEAKER_13]: Two and a half years in the phone world,
that's an antique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes a lot of weird noises.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that was a good rant about Finos
because that Gorilla Glue, what's the
[SPEAKER_05]: other number?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's four and what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just four is all I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a seven or a three or some
shit that I've heard about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need cuts of that one so we can compare
them, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I really want to try that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a lot of great shit for trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be bringing Tangie to Southern
Colorado soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the Tang, because there's a strain
that everyone calls the Tang that is not
[SPEAKER_05]: Tangie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't taste like any of those goddamn
tangerines or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero oranges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why'd you call that the tange?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a blow, goddammit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's a blow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quit trying to front.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you growing now, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Platinum cookies, animal cookies,
Gorilla Glue, Matterport Shines Haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's cookie crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: That won the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whoever took that name, cookies and
cream, I wanted that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But has anybody ever smoked Starfighter or
ain't that what it is, Starfighter?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never smoked it, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Starfighter, is that Rare Dinkness or is
that- Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember you talking about that packet
seed this hour ago for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that and then Endo's Kush is what I've
got going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have a phenol hunt going right
now, by the way, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, if you have timers that have
more than one program, make sure you go
[SPEAKER_03]: through your programs and make sure
there's no extra timers chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can catch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I caught it, thank God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you almost flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you almost flower your plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost unflowered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost unflowered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had it like, well, my room,
some plants look good, so I don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a wrong timer, but it was just weird
because there was no off timer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been in my room and it's not on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what those fancy digital timers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you reset your timer guy,
just reset it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just reset and clear it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just try to go and reset everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually hit the button, default that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple that are just growing
right through it and it didn't matter to
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of happy with those.
[SPEAKER_13]: What light cycle are you running?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you doing the 12-12 or the 11-13?
[SPEAKER_13]: 12-12.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a good way to stress test
your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was mentioning this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is since our phenotopic kind of got
side railed here, we ran out of shit to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stress test my plants before I breed
with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a female and put her in a room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've got four or five new clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put them in the room and I'll run it
on 12-12 for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then about day 15, I'll turn it off
for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Day 15, I'll turn it on for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll put it back on the opposite
12-12.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I was coming on at 10 in the
morning, now I'm coming on at 10 at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll run that for a few more days and
just watch them grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll kind of freak out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll put it back into the normal
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that really pisses off normal plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you will see a lot of things start to
throw nanners and become a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't treat with them if they throw
those bananas on you because those are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be hermaphrodites in the future
that'll cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your passion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Same goes for males, but I don't want to
give away too many secrets.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Figure it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Male stuff is all, that's all proprietary
stuff that you keep on the down low.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, give them that at least.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want people breeding with a bunch
of hermed ass males.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, or the females.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can usually spot a nice hermed male.
[SPEAKER_05]: The top clusters are too close together
and they look like they got fur between
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They start to look like a pussy willow or
something, a foxtail sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a nice hermed out male.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell by that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want those big juicy balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will never say that ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about what kind of traits we
look for in a male in another episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse will come back.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we won't.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we totally, I guess we'll maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, like on episode like 500,
once everyone's listened for a long time
[SPEAKER_05]: and loves us.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing over there,
Spence?
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is being a pyro.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is fire and plastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just puts it down like, I already know
how this shit ends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ends with us outside staring at the house
going, that sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been going for, well,
we've been at it for 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got anything you want to talk
about on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you've ever wanted to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone just kind of shakes their head
and goes, nah, bro, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have one side note back to the feno
hunting thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good because that's what everybody
came to this show for.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big thing I look for is I grow mostly
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to have plants that respond well
to topping and super cropping so I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice even canopy versus having a lot of
lower growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certain strains really don't like
topping.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_13]: Purple.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a very phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: So things like purpling.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even some strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of a, because if you have an
unhealthy plant, they'll have purple stems
[SPEAKER_13]: too.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have seen healthy plants that just
have purple stems.
[SPEAKER_13]: Girl scout cookies purples up completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl scout cookies gets black and gets
purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a black leaf company or black leaf
society.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black leaf society.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have had a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of cookie shots.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might find some of my cookies on
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think some of all of ours.
No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence had something really great to say
and then backed up from the microphone and
[SPEAKER_05]: backed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or nah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or nah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: The notes are done, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've said all the stuff on my notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking over here like,
what can we say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had something you're thinking?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a press pause while you think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be scared to kill your... Red hair
buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael's taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, don't be afraid to kill off those
plants that are not performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I do phenotypes or both pheno hunts,
I usually do probably like a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: seed packs, not just one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of survival of the fittest
for me because seeds, I like to not really
[SPEAKER_03]: like feed them too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like to just let them see which
ones are going to do their thing until I
[SPEAKER_03]: have to start giving them food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, like I kill ones that if it's
going to get overgrown as a seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably going to get overgrown as a
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing wrong with getting rid
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes your hunt smaller and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can focus on other things instead
of now you have one less plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like picking players for the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want those slow runners or the
guy that can't shoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want me on your team.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a lot of spence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take me on your team.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can block, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stand, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right in front of the hoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're both about six, five issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're wondering why we're talking
about sports on a weed podcast events,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing a secret cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should be at the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going with a low cab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be a good time when I think
that September 27th, 28th, that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I had something else going on at
September.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you're playing with that carb cap,
we're going to give a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_05]: the man task rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: These, uh, blue carb caps.
[SPEAKER_05]: These new colored titanium pieces are
dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all don't even know about this shit
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got that new, new this episode's coming
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pre-recording this one because I was
out of town when we should have recorded
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, we're pre-recording, but,
uh, this stuff is new and they look good,
[SPEAKER_05]: bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: The color is not coming off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's looks just like the other carb caps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out task rock and highly educated
titanium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that anodized?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the word, but I'm not
certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it with heat and change the color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't it turn like a rainbow color when
you do that?
[SPEAKER_13]: There'd be a little more variation in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe if that was the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll ask him.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way we know since, uh,
but yeah, if that's anodized, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no doubt task is, uh, you know,
putting out top quality shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: So he's got a very high quality
anodization process.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could just be me, but I've seen so many
people that look like tasks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like people like dressing up like
cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just jeans and a t-shirt, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really an outfit or a costume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a good size dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a big old water hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let Spence go ahead and heat
up the honey hole for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hailing honey hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, thanks for bearing with a bunch
of potheads.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we tried to have a phenotype
discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like we covered a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see if we can name off any other,
uh, famous phenotypes or, or even some of
[SPEAKER_13]: your own, uh, heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's got a real, um, it's a
starbursty question, but I'm growing out a
[SPEAKER_02]: grape Samparogi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does anyone know of any popular
phenotype variation of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one that actually tastes real
grapey that Spence loves a super grapey
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it almost looks, when the buds start
to grow, they're real dense and they look
[SPEAKER_05]: furry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, there's, yeah, that's the one
that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole lot of hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of trichome and just, it's got a real
rigid structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks real crazy in the texture of
the buds themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, I won't be talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully one of these guys covers the
dead airspace while I take this dab and
[SPEAKER_05]: then I'll correct the radio silence.
[SPEAKER_13]: All three of us just looked at each other
like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeff totally leads the conversation for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have any of you guys ever had seeds that
you grew and didn't take clones on?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ended up being like some really,
really good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all of us have experienced that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on for the stab.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are many fish in the ocean,
but yeah, I lost a, uh, um, alien dog,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, that was really bomb.
[SPEAKER_13]: Real sad about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was from a private breeder though.
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't the, uh, alien dog that,
um, that is from a very popular breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently lost my, uh, flow strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone in this room has that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I'm going to get it back,
but what am I going to have to get up now?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had, uh, I grew DNA genetics,
holy grail, Kush from seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys are looking for a dank,
sneaky Kush, that's mostly indica that'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just set you down and tastes like stinky,
skunky feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bitch to grow and it will not
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I try, I gave cuts to other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They couldn't get it to clone,
but that stuff was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DNA genetics, holy grail, Kush,
it just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a pack of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's, uh, he just released a whole
bunch of them, I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I had a, uh, from, uh, from Arian.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't going to name them, but it was a
good phenotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought she had the DNA one,
but I think they're pretty much the same
[SPEAKER_13]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody seen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would, no, this is a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we still recording?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still totally recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask a stupid question anyway,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do shout outs at the end so you'll
know it's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it is a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So OGs are not a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are like, it would be a more of a
genotype.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, lately I think OG is just a sticker
used by a dispensary or a seed breeder for
[SPEAKER_05]: dollar signs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very well put.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: True OGs like the, you know, uh,
yeah, the original ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: According to the story, there's a bunch of
different phenotypes of the genotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, underdog.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, I really think there's two
underdogs and both of them are pretty well
[SPEAKER_13]: known.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys got to speak in an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to shout out another podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did an episode all about OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went up today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not had a chance to listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not on iTunes right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're having a little problem,
but, uh, you can listen to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's YouTube and I think it's
iCannabisRadio.com.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Recorded shows on iCannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those guys talk about a lot of great
shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: On YouTube is the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Adam Dunn and Mitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably don't listen to our show
because they have their own, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, they get a lot of cool guests on
because they're in Denver and because
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam's got a seed company that is very
well known from Denver.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mitch seems to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty well connected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mitch has a new book out, which is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out Mitch Shinasa's new book,
The Cannabis Aficionados Handbook,
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's called.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My pothead memory just pulled that out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's easy to remember pothead things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever grown any TH seeds?
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, no, not actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew sage and sour.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a freebie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really like it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard that called old man's weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't ever a fan of the sage and it won
cups.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sage, I did like it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's an acronym, but it does have
a, uh, a sagey taste to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's mental probably now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's everybody says that probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it is, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Kush and.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't, I say I've never smoked it like
a true Kim or a really, really good sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked some sours, but not like there's
a sour diesel cut that goes around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you smoked any of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew it and I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there wasn't a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be looking for a different salary,
you know, taste, but I've had,
[SPEAKER_03]: I work where I work at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one still haven't smoked it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_13]: First hour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That G diesel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you'll like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dank.
[SPEAKER_13]: When it's done well, that stuff is,
you know, actually the, uh, my friend Josh
[SPEAKER_05]: from La Plata labs rolled a joint of that
shit one night at a party and there were a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of breeders in the room and they all
gathered around that joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for a bunch of breeders to jump up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that your joint?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no, no, it was not mine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Was, uh, I was hoping to hear that Fino
was more of a so good.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been back in 13 years,
regrettably.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, every summer I plan a trip over there
and never happens, but, um, I'm totally
[SPEAKER_13]: gonna cruise through the shop when I do
get over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to do it being an outdoor
farmer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a long drive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse brought me some eggs and,
uh, I cracked open one of those eggs and
[SPEAKER_05]: it almost freaked me out because the,
was it not crazy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like just two times, three times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they taste so much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like store eggs make me nauseous when I
eat them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh God, I can't believe I decided to
cook this.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's factory farming too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's eggs tastes like food and it
seemed like I was supposed to be eating
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he brought me tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, after eating Jesse's
tomatoes, I can't even go buy a tomato
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I got food in Denver the other night
and they came with fresh tomatoes and I
[SPEAKER_05]: bit into the tomatoes and they taste like
soggy mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I am spoiled by Jesse's organic
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a deli downtown called Schlepps
that has my produce there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So shout out to them, bomb ass food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy local produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow your own veggies.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're on main street.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I ate lunch at Bingo burger today
and someone is supplying them with some
[SPEAKER_13]: bomb ass fucking produce too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bingo burger usually does pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good place to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a free commercial for Bingo
burger from a bunch of potheads.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a vegetarian, get that,
uh, that mushroom burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: You eat fish?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've said that I won't eat fish
anymore recently, but I may.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you got in mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a bang and a salmon burger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I ordered it, I was like,
I ordered it and I was like, hold up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go ask them if it's a filet or
if it's like a patty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yo, is this a patty?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like salmon patty?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, no, it's a filet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that on the menu today, but I had
already decided what I was going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green onions, avocado, tomato lettuce,
pesto sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get like a whole wheat grain
bun.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody listening right now just got the
munchies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been all taking dabs and talking
about growing wheat and now Spence just
[SPEAKER_05]: killed everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the munchies.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know we're all the best food in Pueblo
is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, potheads know where to eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a vegetarian, there's like four
spots.
[SPEAKER_13]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cook.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a vegetarian, it totally makes
you just cook at home.
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes me want to open a vegetarian
restaurant though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put a little station in the back where
nobody can see what I'm doing back there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't bother me between bringing me
plates of food and the office.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just call the place the office.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be hard to, in the winter,
it'd be hard for me to have a vegetarian
[SPEAKER_13]: restaurant because I'd just be so
disappointed by the produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know organic vegetables would be really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if we could grow some vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's probably one of the
downsides of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you want to build a greenhouse,
there's certain you're going to grow wheat
[SPEAKER_05]: in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like $1 million.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my retirement plan is, but not for
full of cannabis and yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Greenhouse, flowers, vegetables,
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the music.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally had something I was going to say
we should talk about and just forgot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, have you guys ever grown any produce
inside?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not inside myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like actually like fully ran it
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it inside like to start seed and
shit, but besides that, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say I did the little like
window side herbs and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but nothing other than that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done real basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lettuce, basil, tried a tomato plant one
time and it was taking up room.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got put outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown some great shit outdoors,
but never inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's growing an outdoor vegetable crop for
yourself is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're eating a meal and you're like,
I grew 90% of the stuff in this meal right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I knew how to make tortillas,
man, I would be self-reliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure learning how to make a tortilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smith's is looking at me like he's going
to make tortillas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be over all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, we've almost gone for an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet if I put commercials on this thing,
an intro and an outro and a big shout out
[SPEAKER_05]: to Task Rock, I bet I can make this a nice
even hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got anything fancy to say?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've asked that once, but we've
rambled on for a few minutes since then.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to give a shout out to a chick on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's 710 nurse or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: She replied to my shout out for the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up hippie nurse 710?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a loyal listener.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually know that person in person and
we give her a lot of grow advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know she shouted out on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, chick?
[SPEAKER_13]: She let me know that she's listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: She certainly is.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got some outdoor stuff going on that
looks pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she could.
[SPEAKER_05]: She puts pictures of it on fucking
Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't just call her out on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might give her advice on that once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any shout outs over there, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all looking into your phone,
no?
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence, shout outs, plugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just turned 21.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're finally old enough to go where we
can all go now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to iRogenetics, Jeff,
Jesse, Michael, anybody that's ever been
[SPEAKER_03]: on the show that's not here or anybody
that supports the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for supporting the show for
sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: You gave me a shout out and I got four new
followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the whole Garden of Whedon
crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Fong way out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the guys in other states.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to call out their states,
but even if I met you once or twice in
[SPEAKER_05]: your Garden of Whedon crew, I know who you
are still.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are events in Denver on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Thursday, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a podcast while they're
kicking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say everybody get out in
the community and start enjoying the
[SPEAKER_03]: atmosphere of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado is a special place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other states, you can't do what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got places where we can just go
mingle and eat and hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of getting drunk, we're taking
dads and smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live here, go enjoy it if you're up
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the community, go enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to be a certain type of
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use anybody there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all happy people that all like to
smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come taste some amazing herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come see what your herb can be grown like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come meet a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come meet a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to come out, just don't
mess it up for everyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to learn how to behave
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're too high for crazy stuff,
so we're just going to kick it and smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't try to come take a gigantic dab and
fall over and shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Alcohol in these vins don't really seem to
mesh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that it's ever been a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very little alcohol consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just for the cotton mouth most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually a fruity drink if you see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: This episode won't go out until the start
of next month.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be kind of busy for a couple of times
here, so we're pre-recording.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for us at events, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually post it up on Facebook or
Instagram when we're going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it, because I was going to say
it's at jessigrowse on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_13]: On Twitter, actually, it's at
jessigrowseog.
[SPEAKER_13]: Had to adjust some stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: How did that even happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Twitter painting on your shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at jessigrowseog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado bearded dabbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: On Instagram, that's our buddy Michael
over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get him on the show more because
he's got a lot of good shit to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are always better on the show after
the second or third time.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out garden of weed N on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: He posts a lot of great pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, make sure you check out at
iregenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I post a lot of weed pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been posting, trying to broaden my
spectrum of type of pictures I post.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait till the camera, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, the camera will change
your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine all the pictures you can take of
your plants, but then there's like dab
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures you can take.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the kind of guy that once I buy it,
you're not going to see me for like a
[SPEAKER_05]: week.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be like, where are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking pictures, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have convinced me to just drive to
Best Buy and go pick that shit up pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want one too.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on my Christmas list.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was on my wedding registry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to probably catch one for a
steal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the first one to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you need to support Black
Friday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the epitome of America.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cyber Monday sounds dirty.
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of that, Hygro Supply is about to
launch a nationwide website with the
[SPEAKER_13]: shipping department and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll have our, actually, I think the
prices are going to be a little bit lower
[SPEAKER_13]: than they are in the store, but nationwide
shipping.
[SPEAKER_13]: And everyone can get great deals like we
get here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe there'll be an in-store
pickup program too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll be helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Tote of Soil deal is now over,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't buy one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you going to put that shit?
[SPEAKER_13]: We sold a couple, but I never even saw
one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was wanting to see it, but I never got
to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, how many gallons was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was, I said it would fill 48
seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have lasted me a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I don't need the, if you got the
right spot, you could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Reuse, recycle, reduce, reuse,
recycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The tote bag it came in, I really want one
of those.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to grow some stuff in it?
[SPEAKER_13]: A huge one?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's great for recycling soil in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, make a great compost
pile or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys, we got three minutes
before it's an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody out there in podcast world,
we've been getting over a thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: listens.
[SPEAKER_05]: A thousand people are going to hear all
your guys' crazy voices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's faces just changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael had no idea what he was getting
into when he came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish y'all knew how crazy I looked,
but you don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take some pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll post them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take some pictures and show
everybody how crazy you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes he wears a grill.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't have the grill in today.
[SPEAKER_05]: When he wears the grill, white people get
nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to a wedding.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, maxed it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to hear a wedding grill story.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the normal people that were more
normal were Spence and Matty and myself
[SPEAKER_05]: and Slop and Big Mike were walking through
the crowd and they kind of looked and they
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't sure if we were there to steal
everyone's purse or if we were friends of
[SPEAKER_05]: the groom.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone says they're the black sheep of
their family.
[SPEAKER_05]: You proved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You proved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to everybody that we saw at
that wedding.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Best wedding ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep talking about it on the show
because it was amazingly cool.

Dialects and Con and Boogie for rocking it

[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it this time.

5,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like I'm going to fade out the
music and fade out the show.

[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody knows Adam.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been here a few times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint has been here a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a non-smoker the first few times he
was on the show, but now Clint has
[SPEAKER_05]: converted to the dark side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint is now a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: For you guys that do not know Clint,
he is a comedian or an aspiring comedian.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just a silly open miker.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually been hosting the open mic at
a local bar called Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_05]: When is that and how has it been going,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Tuesday about 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: and come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a place to try out new jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been getting mixed reviews as to
who's coming down and stuff, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's starting to blow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It always takes a little bit to get stuff
going in this town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is Phil's?
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil's is Pueblo, Colorado, C Street and
Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Union and C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or D, whatever it is down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go downtown.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the spot with the nice outdoor patio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys do comedy inside or outside
right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just they got a stage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: What time do we need to get there to sign
up if we want to be on the stage?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to come be a comedian,
try to get down there by 9.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, I'm not going to hold you
against the coals if you're a little late.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get you on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you performed at Phil's yet,
Adam?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've not performed at Phil's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down there last week and just saw
the show and it's a cool place,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam's got dreams of doing some standup
comedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done a couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I didn't make it,
but I've heard he's... It's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's shocking, is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's better than shitty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts with the same letters,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they may have been being nice to you,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've heard what your act is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to go into it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you said that on a show, that is
shocking, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's big balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you guys want to hear some guy with
big balls talk about funny shit,
[SPEAKER_05]: go see Adam the next time he gets his big
balls ready to perform somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you got to go do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I got to go do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got all like monster truckish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome brag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam and I and another hot friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so pumped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it'll be the night that you guys are
listening to the show, probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to go smoke cannabis with
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be getting Doug with high.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not on the show, but we're going to
be doing actually getting high with Doug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to get Doug Benson fucking lit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys are listening to this on
Monday, this will come out Monday the
[SPEAKER_05]: 15th.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug Benson is at ComedyWorks in Denver
tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last I checked, it was not sold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug Benson is well worth your drive to
Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a smoke session somewhere
and it'll be your chance to smoke with
[SPEAKER_05]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a good time if you show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite weed comedian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the most popular weed comedian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you listen to one of his podcasts
almost every weekend and then I watch the
[SPEAKER_05]: other one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just about every week.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two different tastes, you know
what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're still right there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug Loves Movies is one of my favorite
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess go listen to that one when the
show's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're into movies and pop comedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you only have a few minutes
for a podcast, Doug Loves Minis is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a perfect short little show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to it when I take a shower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does about 15 minute episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's long enough to hit play, jump in the
shower, clean your ass, get out and dry
[SPEAKER_05]: off and get dressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got about 15 minutes for a guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Doug, we've promoted you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need you to start promoting us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, we just went on for
like a minute about Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just pumped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Top of the episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been going to ComedyWorks quite a
bit and man, there is nothing like a good
[SPEAKER_05]: show at a good comedy club.
[SPEAKER_05]: ComedyWorks has it freaking correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: We bragged on the show about seeing Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint went the night before us and sat
front freaking road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: They let your hairy ass up there?
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't filming that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just let us up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course they wouldn't have let my ugly
ass up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they were filming, they would put
decent looking people up front,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then a sexy young lady and a guy
showed up and they had no problem telling
[SPEAKER_05]: those people, sorry, you have to move.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would reseat you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this girl in like a tangerine or
melon colored shirt with giant boobs and a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of makeup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could tell she was going to go out
front row.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just walked her right up to the
front row and put her in the front.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they had no problem making people
move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Rainey and Matt Chapman were at the
show and they kind of got put up towards
[SPEAKER_05]: the front, but then they slowly moved them
back to our section.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got moved five times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sat me down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to in line kind of early,
like maybe 30 minutes before the doors
[SPEAKER_04]: were supposed to open.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were in line pretty early and
that's, they just let us in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the group ahead of us was like of
six dudes and there's only seven front row
[SPEAKER_04]: seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like they already had most of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, all right, you guys go to
the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if it's like an ideology
of like, they're going to want to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: more because there's six of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to be talking louder.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only two, me and my buddy Riley,
we go up and we thought, oh, second row,
[SPEAKER_04]: that'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy goes, Hey, there's two more
front.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys want front?
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, yeah, I think I do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's a cool place to be front
row.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm really hoping we get there good
on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Rogan does a beard joke and it felt
like it was directed at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys get that joke too?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ruin the joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not get a beard joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a grateful dead joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I felt as if he were staring me
directly in my eyes telling this grateful
[SPEAKER_05]: dead joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't say that to anybody,
but on the ride home, the girl I took with
[SPEAKER_05]: me said, he looked you straight in the
face when he said the grateful dead joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was talking about Duck Dynasty beards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he did mention Duck Dynasty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mimed a part of his joke because I
really don't want to give it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't want to be on Comedy Central here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to go to that show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Him and I were in the taping.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to be in the taping,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather not next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was stressful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't go take a piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't have to piss, but just
telling me that I can't go take a piss and
[SPEAKER_05]: now I have to piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you're just like, Oh,
I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, suddenly I need to pee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to be sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to pee the whole time he was on,
but I was like, I'm not leaving.
[SPEAKER_05]: No food or drink service during the entire
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: They came and took our beverage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at ComedyWorks, they have a menu
hanging from the chair in front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took the pen.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made everybody take off their hats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little, no logos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, they were moving ugly people
to the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was definitely intense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back row.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sat me under a camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the camera was right above my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I feel like a couple of the
jokes, Joe was looking me in his eyes,
[SPEAKER_05]: telling them to me because it gave him,
yeah, the camera was above my head and
[SPEAKER_05]: they made it feel, instead of talk to that
machine, he could just talk to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it felt a little more natural because
I was high and laughing my ass off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I was just laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a fun place, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just, we went for a walk after.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was fun having, I had a lady friend
with me and I had Adam with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was fun because a dude walked up
and recognized me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, Hey man, are you that guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I am Rasta Jeff from
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked about seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he ever get a hold of you?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're listening out there,
brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phil was his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's up, Phil?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't contacted me yet,
hit me up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me a direct message.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking flyers with me to Denver
Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what you say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've only got a couple of few left.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may need to go to Kinko's and get some
printed.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take five with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to give Tony Hinchcliffe a big
shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we talked about Tony
Hinchcliffe on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about the Joe Rogan show,
but Clint got to go too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really excited.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Hinchcliffe nailed it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is one hell of a comedian.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really, but you could still see,
yes, he's been doing comedy for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you could see another step when you
watch Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say that Tony Hinchcliffe wasn't
great, because that's what I like seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like seeing guys that are better than me
because I can go, oh, I'm not the big fish
[SPEAKER_04]: in the little pond.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little fish in a little pond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit being a, like get better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what I get to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when we bring guys down and they've
been doing it for like five years,
[SPEAKER_04]: eight years, 10 years, you get to see
like, oh, that's where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But seeing Tony Hinchcliffe, and I don't
know how long he's been telling jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's 30, he said.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You listen to the Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that, but he also said it when
he was talking about being, did he do his
[SPEAKER_04]: knit cap bit?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he was like, I'm a 30 year old man
in the knit cap now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I listened to him on Tony, or on Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was, it was magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put my fucking shit in the
microphone to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but Tony Hinchcliffe was on par.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got some really good jokes,
but.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, not only that, but you say Joe
Rogan killed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as a comic to be up there for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I, me and him talked about
it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he was really nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could see the nerves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then a lady heckled him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You told me about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as she heckled him, he came out of
the like nervous thing, went away and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, what bitch?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he kind of went off on her for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when he came back to the set,
he was on point from then on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that heckler kind of helped him
out, kind of helped him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it brought the crowd and him together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before, before that there was a barrier
between the performer and the crowd.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That tension in there affected our
laughter and his performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once that heckler, all of that,
we became one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Tony Hinchcliffe, and you guys can
laugh your asses off if you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Tony Hinchcliffe slightly remind you
of Inea Lujan?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the look.
[SPEAKER_05]: The really mellow calmness.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't shake him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerves of steel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of feels like he's, you know,
he's kind of always up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold his hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And slightly a hipster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't know what I, I looked at
him and I, I didn't think that he felt
[SPEAKER_04]: like, like he was having fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just, like his sense of humor is so
like, yeah, that's kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just, it wasn't, I wish he'd
have been having more fun while he was
[SPEAKER_04]: telling his jokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did invite him back for a weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got to pay attention to when Tony
Hinchcliffe is coming to ComedyWorks and
[SPEAKER_05]: go to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see, I'd love to see more than
how much, he probably did 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did about 15 when we saw him,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So almost talking comedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday night, I went to the Oddball Comedy
Fest, the Oddball Comedy Tour with
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was he like headlining it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was he?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he was actually second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis CK headlined.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were nine comedians.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there were, Brody Stevens was the
host and he said nine comedians and he
[SPEAKER_05]: must've been one of the performers that he
counted because I can't think of who the
[SPEAKER_05]: others were.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Brody Stevens, Whitney Cummings,
Chris Hardwick, Demetri Martin,
[SPEAKER_05]: Hannibal Buress, Sarah Silverman.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to forget somebody because I'm
on the spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Marin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say Louis already?
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody and then Louis CK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was before?
[SPEAKER_05]: Joan Rivers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might've been Joan.
[SPEAKER_05]: That set was quite stale.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Google it because I feel bad
missing somebody on that list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Losing prices, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to get it right because I
feel bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was, I mean, Red Rocks seems like,
I haven't been down there yet,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it definitely, I saw the picture that
you posted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aziz Ansari is who I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you forget Aziz?
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're so little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aziz was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody got 15 minutes,
but I think Louis may have gotten,
[SPEAKER_05]: it seemed like Louis did 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're a comedy fan, we've gone on
for a minute, but you'll get this part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single second of Louis' set was
calculated.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew where to breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew where to take a couple of steps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, and I'm not a comedian,
but I've paid enough attention to you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm friends with all you comedian guys and
I've paid enough attention to what you
[SPEAKER_05]: say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, and I could feel every minute of him,
he crushed it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always be crushing was Louis' motto that
night.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was killing it, dude, on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to see him now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to see his mannerisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've performed, you know,
so it's also performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: You understand like when the singer does
it in this note, it sounds a lot better
[SPEAKER_04]: than this note that's like one octave
higher or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being the drummer, my thing is to play
less.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I overplay as a drummer, then you sound
like you're insecure.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you learn to get older and play less
notes, it's when you sound better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Louis has learned each note
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis, and honestly, not to sound like an
asshole, he was one of the comedians I was
[SPEAKER_05]: not most excited to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't you seen him before?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've never seen Louis CK perform
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen any of those guys perform
live before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to see none of the world's best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aziz was good, really high energy,
stuck to the same joke basically the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: time, told like a story with a lot of
taglines and a lot of callbacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardwick, this affects my podcast hosting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to Nerdist often.
[SPEAKER_05]: I watch At Midnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've followed Hardwick since the freaking
Singled Out days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know he's from Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how he used to play in a band with
Furman called Harden Firm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he comes out at Red Rocks and he puts
his hands up in there and he's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see the 15 year old boy in him
that's wanted to do that since the first
[SPEAKER_05]: time he touched a guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that was his dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just clung his pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of got to share that with my
friend Chris Hardwick through podcasting
[SPEAKER_05]: and that relationship that I feel,
that stalker relationship that you feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like you have with all the celebrities you
follow now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did feel like that with Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like this is my buddy performing
and I've known him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I wanted to, as he was walking
off the stage, I wanted to shake his hand
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, but I was just also like,
he's not a guy you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a weird thing to have this
relationship with people that is a
[SPEAKER_04]: one-sided relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably do the same thing with
Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt pride for him because one of my
buddies just crushed it at Red Rocks
[SPEAKER_05]: because he was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a great, great set.
[SPEAKER_05]: His set was, man, he's kind of a pervert
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a joke and I don't want to blow his
bit, but half of his bit was about fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: your mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for Hardwick to go that route at Red
Rocks, it was funny for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Demetri Martin did his thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Demetri Martin, he surprised me how funny
he was.
[SPEAKER_05]: My date that I took with me, she loved
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who she went to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to chuckle at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Trauma is a killer DJ by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the one that ran music between the
comedians.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we took a 15 minute intermission.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about a 30 minute intermission.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe if you do comedy for too long,
you burn out your funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they gave a nice intermission and we
stood up and danced for a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hannibal Buress was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did his thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made a joke about Colorado having the
ugliest crowd.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he said, it looks like y'all came
from a hike.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he thought about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, you probably all just did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he made a joke about who was the
white guy that broke down out here and
[SPEAKER_05]: decided, let's build a venue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do shows here because Red Rocks is
kind of in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis CK Crush, like I said, Mark Marin
was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: His closer was solid, but you could tell
he was frazzled and didn't know what to do
[SPEAKER_05]: with 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marin's used to 45.
[SPEAKER_05]: To whittle Marin down to 15 minutes is
kind of like, you got to give him time to
[SPEAKER_05]: get out on the stage and sit down at the
edge of the stage and get pissed off about
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he gets into that Mark Marin
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't get time for that in his 15,
I didn't feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: His closer was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't blow anybody's bin on purpose,
but his closer was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah Silverman surprised the shit out of
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her set was great, but she is funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: She is naturally funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could just tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whitney Cummings fucking yells her set at
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Whitney and my jokes are funny,
so you're going to laugh punchline.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's what it feels like the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like you're being barraged with
jokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was funny, but it was a bit fucking
too much for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying the way she delivered them
could have been better.
[SPEAKER_05]: She forgot she had a microphone and she
had to yell.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was Roman style.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I felt that way about her TV shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: When she's on TV, she doesn't feel like
she's speaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: She feels like she's over projecting to me
too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Brody Stevens needs medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brody Stevens was the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brody, take your medicine, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you need to fucking calm down,
Brody Stevens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking harness that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you smoke too much of that good
Colorado weed, but at that show,
[SPEAKER_05]: you were fucking losing your fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a huge fan of Brody Stevens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personal preference there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad that there's some people that
don't like my comedy because if everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: liked it, it'd be like, wow, that was...
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's as fucked up as me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants another Dane Cook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep telling my mom that she doesn't
want to hear that she doesn't fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom's going to come see your comedy?
[SPEAKER_05]: She wants to.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to tape it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to have the camera pointed
at you at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be her reaction the entire time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make sure that nobody's coming to my
shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like family-wise, they don't know when I
do stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be terrible.
They do now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they listen to the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday nights, nine o'clock, Phil's
Radio, downtown Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free to get in, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free to get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any smoke and weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's grounded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grounded.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of smoke and weed, this is a
podcast about consuming cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: growing cannabis, and cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should probably talk a little bit about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a little ranty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, I think our listeners enjoy
getting a little inside of our heads and a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of our world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And knowing what's up with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, that Chris Hardwick talk,
they're my friends now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 29, 30 episodes into being my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've spent 30 hours together now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're bros and sissies, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a lady out there, you're my bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to call you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're family.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for listening to the show,
just as much as all the dudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a female friend who is encouraging
me to do an episode all about women and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told her to research it for me and help
me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys have any ideas for women and
cannabis, it feels sexist.
[SPEAKER_05]: A guy doing a show all about women and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything I come up with, I feel like
it'll be gender biased and it'll be weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ladies, send me some stuff so that I
can do a ladies podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I want to satisfy the listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're asking for it, that's what
we gots to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ranting again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So- Women and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the tremors, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Clint is a comedian, we should remind
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are jokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that one wasn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't even going to open my mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to give a shout out to
Miss Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jessica, you're a badass grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stand up for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite female growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, do you not know any
kind of people from Denver that maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: could travel down and, you know- Yeah,
we can get people on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to do like an hour and
it's easier for, yeah, we'll do a report
[SPEAKER_05]: on it instead of bringing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll talk to Jess and get some info
from her because she's a badass female
[SPEAKER_05]: grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: She grows as good, if not better than
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give her that credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: She grew some Kong that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow at Miss Green Thumb on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll find out the proper, the exact
Instagram address and I'll tweet that shit
[SPEAKER_05]: out so you guys can follow her because
she's a great grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Clint came, I had Clint here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint is, he used to be a nonsmoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he is a new smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny because- New smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took two puffs off of a bowl earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously did not come from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought it in myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt bad about it immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I saw him get plenty high off two good
puffs of some, some shwaggle weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't really shwaggles, but it was not
the dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: You smoked it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not, it's not rasta weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not iry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks similar to that stuff that was in
that bag over here the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on the smoke team now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, he's joining us and now he's
got some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of his main, I wrote down the
questions because we got blazed and I
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't want to forget them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he knew, he looked into my eyes and he
goes, Clint's not going to remember
[SPEAKER_04]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the questions Clint had was
storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, cause I don't know, you know,
I, I, my little bag of weed is my plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking up my weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hate to dis your weed that you got
now, but that's fine to keep in a sandwich
[SPEAKER_05]: baggie.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you upgrade and you get some
quality weed from somebody that's a good
[SPEAKER_05]: caregiver that likes you and doesn't want
to see you smoking that shit anymore,
[SPEAKER_05]: keep your little to-go portion in a baggie
maybe, but keep the rest of it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I store, usually, you know, most people
have like a quarter to an ounce of weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe an eighth of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep it in a glass jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your glass jar size can depend on the size
of your stash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use baby food jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say Adam uses a baby
food jar to keep his weed in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you go to Walmart trying to buy
a jar, for number one, we live in Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's no jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: For number two, they're $6 for a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same size and the same price,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get baby food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I like peas and carrots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carrots and peas, peas and carrots.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So butchered weed in a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully when you get it, it's not too
dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not too wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's at the right point.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I dry and cure my own weed... Guys,
you keep asking for a drying and curing
[SPEAKER_05]: episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse and I are putting that together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're putting a lot of thought and work
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be episode 30 is the drying
and curing episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: So be patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got about a week until that's out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_04]: God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait your turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening and being patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are listening to this next week,
I got a big show coming up September 22nd
[SPEAKER_04]: at Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bringing Ron Babcock through and
he's a professional comedian who's been on
[SPEAKER_04]: TV before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's been on HBO.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been on Comedy Central.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he do weed jokes?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has to.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's from LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's coming from LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to hit Phil's Radiator Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only $5.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good... And he's going to do as
long as he wants to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do maybe 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul's going to do 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Rosales is really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Paul?
[SPEAKER_04]: Garrett Waller is going to be on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Garrett Waller, what's up you giant
fucker?
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge, huge jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he might do a fat guy joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will.
He will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then John Bueno is on that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, John Bueno.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope he wears a fancy sweater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He probably will.
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was rocking Mr. Rogers last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just derailed to plug without asking at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I caught you doing it and I like the
natural flow of this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we expect out of Clint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just ruin the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we expect out of Clint.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where we are because I took notes
and we let you get nice and high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not going to ruin anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the captain of this ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start something called the
Cust jar here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I say, starting on episode 30,
every time I say the word fuck,
[SPEAKER_05]: I will donate a dollar to a charity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a conversation with the guy on
Instagram today and he asked me to donate
[SPEAKER_05]: to a charity and I will find out the
charity that he was asking about and I'll
[SPEAKER_05]: donate a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting on episode 30, every time I say
fuck in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about each episode?
[SPEAKER_05]: However many times you say fuck,
you have to donate to a different charity.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way you're spreading it around maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully I don't say fuck more than
like six or seven times before it starts
[SPEAKER_05]: to hurt my feelings because after I start,
I'm going to throw down the dollars on the
[SPEAKER_05]: table and watch them happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last one you only had two, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully I can get to zero and
hopefully this guy's charity doesn't get
[SPEAKER_05]: anything out of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what your charity is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a good conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a new friend today on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started off mad at me.
[SPEAKER_05]: By something that I posted and I turned
him right around once I explained what I
[SPEAKER_05]: meant and made a friend with the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out Dr. Green thumbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, there are so many Dr. Green
thumbs on Instagram that you won't be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to find which one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that dude, I'm going to donate to his
charity if I say fuck on episode 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anytime after this episode,
the F word cost me a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start to, once it keeps screwing up,
I will increase my value for the F word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and we're also not going to keep
track.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to tell us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, people tweet me.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just we're not going to keep track.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dreadful J has been tweeting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody else has tweeted me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they remind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a compilation of you saying fuck over
and over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've just said fuck like 14 times in
the past five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, me and Clint are allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember putting up any money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll make that a guest stipulation
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll all start matching dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time somebody says it, then we all
got to match it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I'm below poverty level,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that I would just be doing it
just to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint works at a steel mill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck is in his daily vocabulary and
Adam is from the South and you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: he knows like six words and two of them
are fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're talking about storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying baby food containers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, baby food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's just what I use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I literally got tired of going to
Walmart and there being none.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, after you drive to both Walmarts
on either side of town and you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: do I really want to go out to West?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, 98 cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you scoop it out, you clean it
out, let it dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, it's good in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's perfect for an eighth,
you know, especially like a fluffy eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got to wait until you got to make
sure your weeds dry enough to go into a
[SPEAKER_05]: jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was about to say- That's where I
derailed you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm on it, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting good at this podcast thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When my weed, when I'm curing and drying
my weed, I'll leave it a little bit extra
[SPEAKER_05]: moist for my personal so that I almost
have to open.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do smoke flowers still.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't believe that I still smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not always dabs, but I'll leave my
weed a little moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I got to open the jar and take the
buds out and set them down for 10 or 20
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes before I can actually roll a joint
with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my personal.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a production crop for my patients,
I'm a caregiver and the herb that's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to get delivered to a guy later on
tonight, that stuff's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been cured and it's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ready to go into his jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll keep, he's getting a half,
so it's probably going to go in a mason
[SPEAKER_05]: jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be sealed up and he'll just,
he'll probably pull out a little baby food
[SPEAKER_05]: jar worth for himself every couple of days
when he needs it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he hides the mason jar away from the
family and has that in a safe place and
[SPEAKER_05]: keeps his jar in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will also, if your weed is really
dry, that may bring back some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture in the Christmas too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your weed's really dry, I see a lot of
people trying to put fruit and shit in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to bring pathogens and molds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't take a lot of moisture to start
molding up a jar if you leave it in there
[SPEAKER_05]: long enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: This company does not pay me shit,
but I do highly recommend a Boveda or a
[SPEAKER_05]: Boveda Humidipac.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your weed's a little bit too dry or a
little too moist even, you put the proper
[SPEAKER_05]: Boveda Humidipac in with your herbs and it
will properly moisten your herb to the
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture content that is desired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it like 67 or whatever?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to the Boveda website right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the humidity, the perfect humidity
should be around 67 or 76.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhere in between there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the same thing as a humidor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also, yeah, well,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are humidor's for marijuana
specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to mention the name because
I don't want to give them a plug either,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're shiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're metal.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're cans.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a locking seal to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they come in all shapes and sizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's if you're the high roller,
the pro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see people use them to transport
cannabis for the cannabis cups and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll basically have four or five of the
big pound storage ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's three of them in a backpack
and they're loading, getting on an
[SPEAKER_05]: airplane.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's completely, no one ever knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's completely sealed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still scary as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that has your package,
your humidifier package that he's talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about that keeps it all at the same
humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really tell you what it keeps
it at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says that it keeps it within a certain
range of ambient humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have so many products on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know they had so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys go check out the Boveda
website, Boveda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Coral Reefer.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's actually the one that introduced me
to the Boveda products.
[SPEAKER_05]: You a big fan of the Coral Reefer over
there, buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go along.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going to keep your weed
longer than, if you've got some herb that
[SPEAKER_05]: is dried and cured and you know it's not
moist enough, somebody hates the word
[SPEAKER_05]: moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people hate the word moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know your weeds- Why would they hate
the word moist?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if your weed's not too damp and you're
not afraid to get mold in it, you can put
[SPEAKER_05]: your herb in a vacuum sealer bag and
vacuum seal that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vacuum sealers aren't too expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bags aren't too expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seal it up, label it, mark it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people- DJ Short says to put it in
the freezer at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what my dad always did.
[SPEAKER_05]: He put it in a brown paper bag and then
stick it, put it in a bag, put it in a
[SPEAKER_05]: brown paper bag and stick it in the
freezer because that way none of the light
[SPEAKER_05]: would get in through the bag.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to say that also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your jars and stuff in a dark place
when you're not smoking them if you have
[SPEAKER_05]: the opportunity or if you can get an
opaque jar to keep the lights out.
[SPEAKER_05]: A large quantity.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's an eighth or a quarter,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you got an ounce or quarter pound,
keep that out of the- Out of the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that in the dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel really good about that question
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That took a lot longer than I was thinking
it would.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about in jars- if you keep stuff in
jars for longer than I do, obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: so would you go in there once a month and
kind of dump it out?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once it's- once I feel like we're going to
do a whole episode about drying and
[SPEAKER_05]: curing, once that process has ended,
once drying and curing is done,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can put it in your jars and just leave
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost better to leave it because
every time you open it, you're introducing
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen and you're changing the gases that
are in the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plants are actually releasing ammonias
and chlorophylls.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't studied for this part,
so I'm going to say wrong shit and a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of people are going to correct me,
but they're releasing gases inside of
[SPEAKER_05]: there and you're exchanging those gases.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've quit introducing more gases,
the decarboxylation and the changes will
[SPEAKER_05]: stop happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starches will quit becoming sugars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything will stay right where it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like opening a- Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Opening a food product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get it- just gets stale eventually
because it's a change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing will pretty much happen with
your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about this on the show before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like mine a little bit drier because I
put mine through a grinder and still get
[SPEAKER_05]: the keef off of the bud onto my grinder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it when I bring it home.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll sit it in the jar and just leave the
lid half on, half off for 12 hours and
[SPEAKER_05]: then put the lid back on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still moist inside the bud a little
bit, but that outer stuff is flakier and I
[SPEAKER_05]: get dry samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it a little more sticky.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a little more flavor out of it
when it's a little stickier.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't let it dry out so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then your joint burns a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, Hygro Culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a question answered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint came over and asked a great freaking
question after he got high.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also asked, since he's a new smoker- I
did.
[SPEAKER_05]: He asked, so I hope we wrap that up,
how to store your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Baggies are cool, but the baggie has
static electricity and it's stealing all
[SPEAKER_05]: your shit and all your shit's sticking to
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: A nug jug of some sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have to be sneaky, they sell
skunk-proof bags that are smell-proof.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also, at Hygro Pueblo, they offer a
duffel bag-style bag and a backpack that
[SPEAKER_05]: they claim is smell-proof.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not tested it by putting any
products in it, but they claim such and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're decently priced.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they work, that's worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also stash cans and things like
that that you can get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you've seen them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's hiding.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more being secretive here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really looking to keep it secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can keep it- Well, you already got it
like a little case.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So his next question was a normal new guy
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: How am I going to pass my P test?
[SPEAKER_04]: Working sucks, right, everybody?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working for the man does suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, you with me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies, you listening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Working sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to tweet all that stuff
at at tall Clint and not at Hygro Culture,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send your comments to at tall Clint,
ladies.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I meant watch us work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, work sucks, but I like my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, my job does not like people
that smoke marijuana and it sucks because
[SPEAKER_04]: I like my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could quit, I would, but it's
just life's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got three women asking me for money all
the time and I got a family.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just cracking up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want somebody to come crash your
podcast, invite a comedian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just destroy this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we need to loosen up and have more
fun on this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always been real tight reading news.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today on the news, there was weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that we got somebody here to just-
What's that character's name?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but he was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to stick around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you worried about them popping random
drug tests or are you worried about
[SPEAKER_05]: getting hurt and them wanting you to pee
in a cup for workers when they come?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two times that I can get
UA's.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like randoms are I don't know with
anybody that's got- Coming from a weed
[SPEAKER_05]: smoker that's dealt with this time and
time again, randoms, it's just the dice
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're rolling, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the iRegenetics only surefire way
that I think I know how to get past a drug
[SPEAKER_05]: test that has worked for me multiple times
when I was a heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually went 63 days without smoking
cannabis at one point and took a pee test.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to get a bad ass job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was promised a killer job.
[SPEAKER_05]: 63 days and could not pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was drinking cranberry juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was killing the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: My family was mad at me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, honestly, I went to reggae
on the rocks and didn't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I quit from the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_05]: I puffed down and then for 90 days after
that or 63 days after that, I didn't smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: and still could not get this job that I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told them, I was like, I haven't
smoked in 65, 63 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, sorry, you still didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, can you give me 30 more days?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were already hiring for the
position.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so the next time I needed to take a
pee test, I could not risk my pee even
[SPEAKER_05]: going in the cup, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your best bet is to use fake piss
because they are not checking for fake
[SPEAKER_05]: piss or piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking for THC, crystal meth,
opiates, ecstasy, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our case, hopefully guys, if you're
listening to my show, hopefully the only
[SPEAKER_05]: thing they're going to find in your pee is
some fucking medicine, some cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's not my spot to judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they sell a product that is straight up
fake piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is designed to be fake piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually at some kind of a hedge shop
around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of spots you can go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't know where they are if you
live around here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't endorse either one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got to work out a sponsorship if they
want me to say their names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start paying us Mr. Money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you go there and you get this fake pee
and it's got a thermometer on the side of
[SPEAKER_05]: the container.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottle has a thermometer on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should come with a, it's a glove warmer
for the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: You crack the thing open and you put your
gloves, you put it in your gloves and it
[SPEAKER_05]: warms your hands in the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it doesn't, you got to go buy one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I do, this is how I surefire
passed more than one drug test.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get this product and I microwaved it for
seven seconds in my microwave and that
[SPEAKER_05]: made it a little too hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took a sock and I cut the sock off
and I stapled it to the inside of my
[SPEAKER_05]: boxers to where it looked like it was my
dick swinging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put that warmed up bottle of microwaved
fake piss in the sock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could tell that it was going to be warm
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went too long in the microwave.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing got down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need it between 96 and 100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where your body is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me intervene here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just use the heater in the car and a
plastic bag in my boxer line, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not probation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one should be watching you piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be taking you to a lab and you
should be going into a closed area where
[SPEAKER_05]: you can pull out your dick and go,
woo!
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they wash your hands and check your
pockets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what I'm saying in the boxer
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got this swinging sock with a fake
pee in it that's been microwaved and I've
[SPEAKER_05]: let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've driven around long enough to let it
get to the right temperature because
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got so much time to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, if you're a union worker,
I would assume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to send you to the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means you're going to get off of
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a couple of minutes to go drive by
the house or 7-Eleven even and hit the,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to piss and run into 7-Eleven and
use their microwave or a crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to, if you're working a
job where you might get pee tested,
[SPEAKER_05]: you need this shit in your locker or in
your truck or somewhere close.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can carry this fake piss in your
cigarette pack, you're a fucking genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a small bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little tiny bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got fake pee, keep it in your shirt
pocket, do something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get hit with this pee test.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go, you're driving, maybe they take
another car to drive you to the gas
[SPEAKER_05]: station.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, I got to pee, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or can we stop and get a pack of
cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Go in there and hit that microwave for
seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do whatever you got to do to warm that
piss up to the proper temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you got that glove cracker,
use that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrap it around it, put a rubber band
around it, put it between your legs and
[SPEAKER_05]: squeeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you feel your legs getting too warm,
that shit's probably right at the right
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got that little bottle,
it's tucked inside of a sock, it's
[SPEAKER_05]: strapped inside your boxers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls, you're going to have to modify.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to look like you got a dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you follow my method, maybe it'll help
you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't wear a skirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pull out this little bottle and just
stick it out of the pee hole you're
[SPEAKER_05]: flying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick your hand in there and stick your
thumb out so it's like your dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if they're standing behind you or
something, you're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_05]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stick your thumb out, make that look like
your dong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always fart during a pee test if someone's
watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just mandatory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I squeezed the bottle the first time I
did it into the little sample cup and it
[SPEAKER_05]: went when I let go of it because it tried
to suck in more air.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tip it up so that you don't make a bong
sound when you're fucking doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or fart right at that point if you can
time it because you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then stick that thing, close it back
up, screw the cap on, stick it back in
[SPEAKER_05]: your underwear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't wash your hands, leave the cup there
like you're supposed to and hope that you
[SPEAKER_05]: just put enough of the right temperature
fake piss in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that fake piss worked for me more than
once.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fake piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't trust.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend, I won't say his name,
he had his girlfriend pee in the cup and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's how they found out that my buddy
was pregnant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely don't use female's piss,
but I have, I've never used my own piss
[SPEAKER_05]: ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even want to ask any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not trying to mask it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to replace it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they're not looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of things you can drink,
eat, or whatever to take.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all they've done is upset my stomach
and give me diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time you get to the lab,
you got to pee so bad that your pee is
[SPEAKER_05]: clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go, oh, this is diluted.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't even test it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it comes through you and if you
smoke like Adam and I do, I dab at least a
[SPEAKER_05]: half a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could honestly probably quit
for 15 days and you would be fine,
[SPEAKER_05]: but don't, you know, it's technically 30
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, is I don't want to quit
smoking weed though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, and it's just the random that's
going to come up, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanted to quit, I wouldn't have
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you should, you should definitely get
prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, that's one of the best
options that I've heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would just keep hand warmers on
the ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'd start wearing shirts with pockets
and like, you know, don't touch me.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day you're standing there talking to
your boss.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this big, are you lactating Clint?
[SPEAKER_04]: My pocket protector's not working today.
[SPEAKER_04]: My nipple peed all over me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be a joke there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's definitely a joke there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't take your jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like your jokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm not going to use them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a 40 minutes, 41 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys want to, you want to do one more
question or you just want to answer one
[SPEAKER_05]: more question?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one more, but I bet we could go on
for quite a while about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we do it, it'll kind of make it a long
question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to know what it's about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the question was what kind of lights
are you using for each phase of growing?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be really long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it could be really simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So quick rundown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I started off doing a bunch of grow
lessons and we got sidetracked because
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse came over and started doing outdoor
grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started talking about all kinds of
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of lost track of the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise to get you caught up on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so much shit going on that
it's hard to even catch up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a busy season.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a great year to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been so much cannabis news and
stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a busy season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse will be here in a couple of days and
we're going to work on finishing up the
[SPEAKER_05]: drying and curing episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll definitely be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what kind of lights do I use?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_05]: For seedlings and stuff that's just
starting, simple T5s are fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of guys- You mean fluorescents,
correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: T5 fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_05]: T5s are the little skinny bulbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they name them T5s are the skinny ones
and T8s are the bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what size they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I keep my seedlings and my clones under
T5s until they're good and rooted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on which room they're going and
what I'm trying to do with them,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes they'll stay under T5s until
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm just doing a three gallon pot of a
little plant- And the reason why you run
[SPEAKER_05]: T5s is not only because of the heat,
but because you can get them closer to the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put them right on the plant and
they're more energy efficient than a big
[SPEAKER_05]: light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that the plant really
needs a thousand watt light when it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just give it enough just to end
that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell two different color bulbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get the blue ones, those keep your
plant short and squat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we want for veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until your plants are two and a half,
three feet tall, that's plenty of light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't keep them too crowded in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them plenty of space with the T5s.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's definitely helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people flower with T5s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not impressive, but if you're in
Tennessee where you're not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_05]: growing weed and you can't get a big light
built, that's going to be better than
[SPEAKER_05]: buying weed off of some dirt on the
street.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen some people grow some pretty
dank stuff, you know, with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to start, I like the T5s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they get a little bit larger,
I will throw them under- I go straight to
[SPEAKER_05]: the thousand watt metal halide for
vegging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a nice veg room with thousand
watt metal halides in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep them kind of close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Hortilux, I think it's the blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget which one they make for- it's the
Hortilux lights they make for vegging,
[SPEAKER_05]: the blue one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome for vegging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hortilux makes a high pressure sodium that
is red.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's super awesome for flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to switch to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now with your- when you step from the T5s
to the bigger lights, how- just give us a
[SPEAKER_05]: range on like how far you want to keep
them, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: As far- as close as you can get them
within- you don't want them- you don't-
[SPEAKER_05]: you kind of want to get them as close as
you can without burning the plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there is a range around a thousand
watt light bulb that is unusable light for
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too intense and it's the wrong
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to back up about a foot and a
half, two feet from the bulb is probably
[SPEAKER_05]: your best bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But only the tops of your plants are up
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bottoms of your plants,
you got to- there's a lot of factors to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep in there, but about a foot,
18 inches to a foot is probably about as
[SPEAKER_05]: close as you really want to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you've got some amazing cooling,
you know, if you've got really well-ducted
[SPEAKER_05]: and ventilated lights, then you can get
them 10, 8 inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes that burst of light coming
right out of there isn't what the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: really want.
[SPEAKER_05]: That will kind of stress the plants and
change the flavors and kind of do a few
[SPEAKER_05]: things that if you want a certain effect,
that's how I achieve one effect when I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to do something, is light stress
the plant a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to tell too much about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm vegging under the T5s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm moving to the metal halides and then I
go to high pressure sodiums to finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: A long time ago, I tried an experiment
using high pressure sodiums and metal
[SPEAKER_05]: halides and I honestly get the best
flavors using a mixture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got four high pressure sodiums with a
one metal halide right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_05]: the room and all the plants in the middle
of the room were a little more dense,
[SPEAKER_05]: had a little more flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned that by running the old
reflector called the Grozilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: It holds two bulbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a 600 sodium and a 400 halide in
there and everything in that little tester
[SPEAKER_05]: hut came out dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the pictures of headband on my
Facebook are actually from that hut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen those pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is headband yours?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to plug your shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice try.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I got to talk to Dr. Dank today
or Mr. Dank today, the creator of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a little conversation on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of nice because I did not
create Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people try to give me credit for
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Dank created Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I simply put it into seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I reversed a female, made a male out of it
and put the pollen on another female and I
[SPEAKER_05]: made seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dank cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made seeds out of the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to give credit to the guy
that made it, thank Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks Mr. Dank for letting me use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually gave me permission to put it
into seed and he said all he wants is
[SPEAKER_05]: some- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought everybody deserved good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of why I started making seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I usually do fluorescents, halide,
sodiums.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people will ask about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to knock an LED light, but my
friend Nancy- Kills it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She is killing it with an LED light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's running Capelton too.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both look frosty and dank and- Pretty
much all of her stuff is on point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just about to say she's running a
lot of stuff that's from other growers,
[SPEAKER_05]: not even me, that looks amazing just as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the one that she's got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it DB Cooper?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just giant nugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nancy's doing a great job with the grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Nancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about women growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always get her to write something
a little- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's probably a well-spoken individual
that could probably put a paragraph in
[SPEAKER_05]: that you could read.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support those women growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what Clint says.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I was just making a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to have an approach as a comedian.
[SPEAKER_05]: One time Clint told me, go on the
chauvinist route and I believed him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a little misogynistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no denying that you were good at
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's really easy and that's why I
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is because for me, it's easy to write
those jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an easy target.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying women are easy targets.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the- I'm staring into my computer
like, how do I fix this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just took it this direction almost on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got any- I'm going to let Clint
do some plugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint has a lot of shit to plug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about your Facebooks, your
Instagram, your shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we call you to cuss you out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do we email you to send you hate
mail?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best way to get a hold of me is probably
Facebook or Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at tall Clint and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find the wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been doing a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably have about one showcase a
month and this one, this one's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: rough because it's on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just, but he's just passing
through and somehow we booked him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Ron Babcock and he's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look him up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a funny guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm free that Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for five bucks, I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a professional comedian coming to
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not like, Oh, it's unheard of,
but it's like, you guys are going to miss
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want anybody to miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh, I didn't even hear about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I heard like one of my favorite
bands, Baroness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard, they're like a metal
band.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite bands and my buddy
Paul, who does comedy with me,
[SPEAKER_04]: told me, yeah, we had them back in like
2000 come through and play some house
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like a huge band in metal and
they're just like, I missed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's why you miss it though
is because you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not enough to do in Pueblo to
where you guys can be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, that's fine during
the fair, but you don't have anything to
[SPEAKER_04]: do right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something going on down there
every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like though, you know,
it's hard to distinguish what's good and
[SPEAKER_05]: what's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why I'm inviting you to this
for five bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can watch a professional comedian.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can watch me be a fucking piece of
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Paul and John are there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got two out of four, at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be a good show.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have faith in you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, we talk a lot of trash about you
open mic or comedians, but you guys are
[SPEAKER_05]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been at it for quite a while and
you're getting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are funny now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Comedy scene here has definitely blossomed
and evolved in quite a nice way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another one opening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's we're just getting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Comedy heals the world guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Comedy and cannabis, they go well
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's a good way to end this
portion of the show.

[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse came over and we pretty much wrapped
up the flushing and harvesting and
[SPEAKER_05]: trimming section of the outdoor lesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to waste any time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go ahead and get right to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to pretty much wrap up the
outdoor groceries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jesse's with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, bro?
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_13]: How's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're both dabbed out, so we're going to
have another one of those episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grab some pins and paper, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys might want to take notes for this
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was told that people are writing down
shit that I say that kind of scares me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at a grow store.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just there to pick up a couple
of small random items.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lady at the counter turned around
and she said, Jeff, I know you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she made me come over and shop for her
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, the solution that I gave
her, I learned from our good friend,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the problem?
[SPEAKER_05]: She was trying to figure out it wasn't a
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just wanted to know which which bat
guano to use late in the bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: season.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one should she have used?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I told her, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gosh, I'm so glad I was right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told her Jamaican late in the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned that from my buddy,
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope you listen to the podcast,
because I told you that you should.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we have proven that you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have also admitted that I was only
90% sure of that when I told you that at
[SPEAKER_05]: the grow store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Burn knew what she was talking about,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do a good job at the Hygro Shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, go to Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: The place is awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got some big news coming up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't say it yet, but it has to do with
a really popular new lighting system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know the news yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to grill Jesse here in a
second and find out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: What else?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we got to sell on the... Black label?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, black label.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black label nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they 50% off?
[SPEAKER_13]: 10% above cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10% above cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever... Check it out, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever they paid for these nutrients,
they're going to sell them to you for 10%
[SPEAKER_05]: above that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after that, it will no longer carry
the line of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not a big seller for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a small shop also.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't carry every single line in
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: We replaced it with some Botanicare
products and we already sold out of the
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff we stocked in today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recommend Botanicare strongly to
everybody that I teach how to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could have some small factor.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to carry every product they
have.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, if you listen to this show,
I don't talk a lot about the nutrients I
[SPEAKER_05]: use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to keep a lot of my... That's kind
of stuff that I like to let people
[SPEAKER_05]: experiment on their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Botanicare doesn't pay me anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Hygro Pueblo, support their new
adventure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a venture?
[SPEAKER_05]: Their new business venture in stocking
their store with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what I use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about grow, feeding recipes
and shit, and all of it is included
[SPEAKER_05]: Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peerblend Pro Grow, the soil-based
formula.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells almost drinkable, and for your
nutrients to smell like you would
[SPEAKER_05]: almost...
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's chicken shit in there,
so I don't really think about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we got that stocked in now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cannabis cup winning nutrients right
there.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've used the NC... Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_13]: SN91 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more their commercial line.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: You get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_05]: They seem to pay attention to what we're
trying to do, and they're also good to the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't seem to be real dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Liquid Karma is a good product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can add Liquid Karma to any feed
regimen, and it will help you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the pure blend tea or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vitamino is a new product that they're
putting out that is a good product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got that now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fulvex and a foliar spray is a good
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And OGT.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not getting paid for any of these
free commercials we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just from our heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what we use.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's high quality products that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't talk about bullshit on this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is time to talk about the end of the
grow season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that music was distracting both of
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's focus a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoor season has been fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's stolen your shit, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have to shoot anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll accept one guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll accept that one guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you got to harvest everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you didn't get that frost on it
that one night.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming up guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't cut down yet, you're a week
or two away, maybe three or four weeks at
[SPEAKER_05]: the most, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Either that or you're prepared for the
long haul.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a greenhouse covered and you've
got a heater out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're just out in the backyard,
it's really time to get your shit
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to flush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flushing is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you're good, this is something
that I've always wanted to touch on on the
[SPEAKER_05]: show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk for, we'll give it however much
time this takes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you're feeding all of your cannabis
plants, you are pouring, even if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: using organics, you're pouring stuff into
the root zone that is staying in the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: and your plants are feeding off of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to smoke whatever you're
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want that taste in your buds at
the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want potassium in your buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plant actually takes up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: It puts the nutrients where they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then yes, your plants do spit out the
excess nutrients through the roots again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It basically shits them right out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm keeping this real simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we need to do now is flush the
toilet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get that poop soil out of
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want clean dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're recycling your dirt,
this is a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where you actually start recycling
your dirt is at the flush of an indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this works for the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to do this to every cannabis plant
you ever grow before you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 to 14 days before you cut down that
plant, water the shit out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Water it as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from then on out, only give it clean
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just clean pH if you can, but this is the
end.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just give it a lot of clean water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Water it real well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you jump in.
[SPEAKER_13]: On a container plant, say it's a 20 gallon
container, I'll give it 20 gallons of
[SPEAKER_13]: water.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, I want to see, you know,
pretty much you'll have, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_13]: 17 gallons of water come out probably.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, run off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I drag a seven gallon pot to an area where
I have a drain and I will pour about 15
[SPEAKER_05]: gallons of water through a seven gallon
pot and repeat it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is, yeah, just keep pouring
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get, you get however much water you
can fill that pot with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour it in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it drain through.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll pour out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back in a couple of minutes,
pour another pitcher or a bucket or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour more water in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can set the hose in your plants,
on your pot plants, water them until
[SPEAKER_05]: you're afraid that it's overwatered.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not too worried about killing them
at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't overwater them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: That water will go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to get all that nutrients off
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The indoor container plants, Jesse's
perfect on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just water that pot as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have to, it's kind of hard to get a
plant somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're working a seven gallon pot,
you need to get it kind of up off the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground so it'll drain properly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: A shop vac is your best friend if you
don't have adequate drainage.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or set that, a lot of you guys are growing
in the basement and you got a dedicated
[SPEAKER_05]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Set that sucker in the shower,
put it up on two cinder blocks under the
[SPEAKER_05]: pot so that it doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that creates a lot of drainage space.
[SPEAKER_05]: That water will pour right out of those
bottom holes of the pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got a three gallon pot,
set that, put a couple of cinder blocks in
[SPEAKER_05]: your garage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe where you can get some water going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you've got a cool backyard where
your stash is kind of hidden, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: want to, don't show your pot plants to
your neighbors and be real careful about
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing bugs in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to flush them real good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always 14, it's 10 to 14 days with nothing
but water.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had any nutrient burn problems,
get in there maybe a week before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, I don't think you can over flush.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing you're going to do is kill
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's going to run out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be starving to death.
[SPEAKER_13]: You drown the roots because you're giving
it, you know, 15 gallons.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flushing will help your plants burn
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll dry and cure better.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll smoke, they'll smoke better.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll smell better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever smoked pot that it almost
tastes like you just stuck your tongue in
[SPEAKER_05]: a light socket and like leaves that burnt
shit on your tongue?
[SPEAKER_05]: That probably had not been flushed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I can name the brand of
nutrients sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can taste worm castings a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes in people's weed, I can taste
advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, if you overdo a couple of things
in botanic care, I can taste it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you overdo it and don't flush it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Lucas formula always has its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think GH always has a, it brings out the
limonene smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a candy, lemony, lemon head candy
kind of a smell when you use GH.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've got something that you want
that is a lemon strain and you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring out that lemon feed at the general
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I don't say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of a secretive thing that a
lot of us know that one of those things
[SPEAKER_05]: that you have to like read a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stressing the plant with light stress and
heat will bring out limonene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're trying to lemon up your lemon
strains, drop that light a little bit too
[SPEAKER_05]: close around week six of ripening and
you'll bring out the limonene terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard you say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll also stress your plants a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to have to adjust on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your top leaf is going to brown up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we're not grown for pretty
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, sometimes it's what you got to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl Scout cookies is gorgeous right up
until about week eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she's so damn ugly.
[SPEAKER_05]: She just goes, wow, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, she's pretty up close.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's, oh man, you get to taste her head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, my girl's got cookies bag is in
another room.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm teasing you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out this girl's Gorilla Glue number
four nugget.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to reach.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually haven't seen anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the finished product of the Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody around here is passing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like an old skunk nug.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or some cola, I should say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's that's a nice shout out to
Elbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does not listen to the show,
I don't think, but I'll get him to and
[SPEAKER_05]: he'll hear this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's well done.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a good job with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's ready yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it smokable?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little, it's moist.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, there's a nice little prop for when
we get to curing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people hate the word moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to throw in moist out there
because, you know, it does that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've kind of ranted on about flushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The point here is flush your damn weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can tell the people that can tell can
tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're the ones that you want to
impress.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's hydro flushing is even more
important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't really talk about hydro growing very
much.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have zero experience in hydro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about as far as I get.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen sparky weed from hydro weed or
from hydro systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're constantly, if you've got a res
full of nutrients, you're constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: pumping that plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, it's important throughout the
entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every couple of weeks, you should be
flushing and using one of those flush
[SPEAKER_13]: products, Clear-X.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just about to ask, how do you feel
about those flush products?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not necessarily for dirt, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: But for hydroponics, you needed to help
flush your medium off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those things break up salts is mainly
what they do.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all like a sugar of something,
like a sucrose of something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never researched what they are.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know exactly how it works.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm dancing all over the mic on Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get him honed in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm turning myself down so that I can turn
you up and it'll make us sound even.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am super fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not getting you very well on the
computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to the mic real good for me for a
second.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come up kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to come up good enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll keep you going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to turn just you up
anymore without making it weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, if he's too quiet, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So flushing your plants really good is
really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to impress Jesse and I with your
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only way you're going to do it,
the only way you're going to win a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis cup is by flushing your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you don't want to give sick people
weed with shit in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what a caregiver does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what a compassionate person does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not what a responsible person does.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on the other team and you're
growing that weed that should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on this reason that makes
prohibition happen if you're growing weed
[SPEAKER_05]: that has not been flushed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly what he said.
[SPEAKER_05]: The look on your face is like,
shit, you think about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even know which side you're on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not even sick people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you just don't want to put that in
anyone's body.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a horrible thing to do to someone.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're going to talk about de-leafing.
[SPEAKER_05]: After you flush, a few days before harvest
time, you want to get in there and take
[SPEAKER_05]: off the fan leaves, all those big leaves
that are in your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they've got what's called a pedial,
that's the stem that reaches to the large.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some other people pronounce it
differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tweet me and argue me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just how I've read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything with the pedial, you can reach
and cut off, chop all those leaves off,
[SPEAKER_05]: clean those things out of your grow room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just chop them and leave them on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those bring bugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Feed them to your chickens.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've had a clean grow room,
you can possibly juice those if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw those right in there with your kale
and your white people smoothie.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get in there, cut off all those fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can cut off some of the outer leaf if
you want, but you might want to save that
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're making hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just decide how much dry comb is on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's not a dry comb on it,
you can take it off right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you mentioned, Girl Scout cookies,
they always have a little pedial coming
[SPEAKER_13]: out of the nug.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, such a long one too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Depending on how far it is, like you said
with hash, some of them are a little
[SPEAKER_13]: closer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll keep that one on there just because I
see that little bit of resin on there and
[SPEAKER_13]: I can get greedy with resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're resin farmers, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our goal is resin.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, if it's very long, I've cut that
fucker off, coming out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: So clarify that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a knob that'll turn everything up
a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cut off all those fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, while you're flushing, you've got a
few days now, you know you're flushing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know harvest is coming, you've taken
off the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's the time to prepare the harvesting,
the trimming and the drying area.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a space.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go back real quick to flushing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you feel about like the sweetening
agents, molasses and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I use this shit out of molasses.
[SPEAKER_13]: With my outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first, I start flushing really early.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I actually, I started two plants
flushing this week.
[SPEAKER_13]: I give them two molasses feedings before I
actually start flushing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just molasses, but it's pretty
heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know what's going in my plants and
this is, so I try to keep it basic because
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to steer anybody wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want everybody to learn the right steps,
but I do sort of something similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feed them enzymes, carbohydrates and
molasses at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll get some hygrozyme is the
enzymes I prefer and they'll get the
[SPEAKER_05]: molasses and sometimes maybe some yucca
extract and coconut water and sucanet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's yucca extract and coconut water and
sucanet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hygrozyme on that last flush day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got 14 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like day 14.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really strong mat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from then out I flush,
but I don't overfeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I don't overfeed and I've got
plenty of space to flush properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can, I drag a plant to a watering
area and just fucking hose on it until
[SPEAKER_05]: it's flushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually just, I converted the old
bathroom that was in the work joint into
[SPEAKER_05]: just the flushing spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the guy's got to pee with no stalls.
[SPEAKER_13]: My building doesn't have indoor plumbing,
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, if you have all that stuff that
you're taking for granted, you're way
[SPEAKER_05]: ahead of the game sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are guys that have been growing
since before we could talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to go to the hydro shop with your
hat down in your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rent a car.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get looked at like that guy grows weed,
even if I'm not at the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Colorado is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we flushed, we've used some sugars and
enzymes and coconut water and some yucca
[SPEAKER_05]: extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to use them all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use these differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sucanat may need a little while to
break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may need something to help that
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: The enzymes are going to be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're preparing the dry space,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that where we are?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean up your drying and trimming space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any dust, dog hair, hippie hair,
all the crap that's on my table.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just, a bunch of dab resin to
tell you the truth, but all that shit is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to end up in your weed that you're
cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once again, that's just as important
as having a good flush.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want crap on your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just spent 70 day flowering cycle,
plus however long we took to veg that
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus if you're doing a pheno hunt,
you're risking, you got to tell which
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds are good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if they're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a big plant too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Put a lot of work and nervous nights into
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And have a nice secure area while we're at
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not write that down, but have a nice
secure area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And think about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're making concentrates,
every piece of dust and hair and
[SPEAKER_05]: particulate is going to end up in your
concentrate somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you're blasting butane over it,
you're going to blast dog hair juice into
[SPEAKER_05]: your hash, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know technically what you're
getting, but that's what you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: find in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all going to end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in your trimming area, your work area,
cover your table, get a plastic cloth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys use rubber gloves when you're
handling your plants, when they're
[SPEAKER_05]: growing, when you're chopping them.
[SPEAKER_13]: For God's sake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen how you do fingerprints when
you commit a crime.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're leaving oils and hippie goop and
human goop and Cheeto stains all over your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are some rubber gloves?
[SPEAKER_13]: Our oils actually affect the plants for
long-term storage and plants that have
[SPEAKER_13]: been handled with bare hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a BHO dab, you can decarboxylize a
BHO dab enough with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think by rolling BHO around in your
fingers, you can decarb it enough to be
[SPEAKER_05]: edible, like processed as a Delta-11 THC
by your liver.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can do that by rolling it in
your hand, imagine what we can do to a
[SPEAKER_05]: trichome on a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can butcher it, ruin it, kill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're leaving weird oils that are
fighting.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you said decarboloxing, I was
thinking of de-waxing and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_13]: floating in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody asked me what is de-waxing,
we need to get a hash maker over to say
[SPEAKER_05]: more technically what it is, but I'll
explain it on a later episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have nothing to do with explaining that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in your trim room, you should have
comfy tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have some good music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's going to argue over the music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put on the agriculture podcast episode one
and hit play.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually like to put up stand-up
comedian shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to comedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly listen to a lot of Joey Coco
Diaz and Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to a podcast when I'm trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite podcasts hasn't posted
an episode in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little annoyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up Adam Hill?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my new podcast buddy?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to keep on track here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting into the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Preparing the area.
[SPEAKER_05]: The area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gloves, comfy chairs, good music.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go back to dry area.
[SPEAKER_13]: Preparing that dry area.
[SPEAKER_13]: Preparing the dry area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humidifier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fans.
[SPEAKER_13]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly a fan or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either and or air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to need to keep it between 60
and 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go up to 75 degrees if you need
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's in your bedroom or something,
you're going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't stress.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep in mind though that heat is one of
the biggest enemies of a drying plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you want it dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Light.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've had all kinds of light beaten down
on your plants for months, but now we want
[SPEAKER_05]: it dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want those to stop growing and
degrading.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to kind of suspend the animation
right where we are.
[SPEAKER_13]: It protects the trichrome heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We picked them at the right maturity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want them going much further.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also want our humidity at 40% if we
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much more than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go any lower, you're going to dry
too quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go any higher, of course,
you risk molds and it's going to take too
[SPEAKER_05]: damn long to dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're in the dirty south, do the best
you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Us in Colorado, it's funny that you say
that because in the south, you read
[SPEAKER_05]: stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, so when you harvest your
weed, you got to dry it for 20 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what the?
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you read in Colorado,
you're like, so cut it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five days later, you got dried buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, oh yeah, they must be must be
in Colorado in February.
[SPEAKER_13]: It really varies from region to region.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even like what side of the state
you're on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humans dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got your fan, you got your
dehumidifier, your humidifier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to have, if you can afford it,
if you can do it, put a carbon filter and
[SPEAKER_05]: a blower in your drying room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvesting plants stink.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm choking on a dab over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvesting plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your neighbors will smell it 10 times more
than you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been around them every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so used to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had just gotten done trimming and didn't
have any plants on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody came over and they're like,
damn dude, I can smell your plants from
[SPEAKER_05]: the garage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't even have plants
at this house.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just me reeking of trim.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had lady in loaf and jug always tells
me I smell good.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just coming home from work.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people at Lowe's know what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're buying weird shit smelling like
dank all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The restaurant owners always love me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's hungry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got that carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you need a hygrometer that just
tells you what the humidity is and a
[SPEAKER_05]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell a great one at Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, that is something you can get at
Walmart anywhere in the nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lowe's has remote control thermometer
hygrometers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can set the unit in the room and then
you can carry the thing around with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever you're curious, you look at
the thing and it tells you, you don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: to run to the grow room and look.
[SPEAKER_13]: My dad has one.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has a chick on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he seriously got this at Lowe's or
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when it's hot, she's in a bikini.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it's cold, she's in a coat and a
scarf and everything all bundled up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a great moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see your dad smiling at that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put more heat on your mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got, yeah, the rooms are looking
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a place to harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a place to dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you need a spot to hang your buds or
your whole plants, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Set up a hanging space with plenty of
space between your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a small crop, you can use a
coat hanger and put two plants on one coat
[SPEAKER_05]: hanger if they're little, like three
gallon pot kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got a five gallon pot,
hopefully you've made enough pots where
[SPEAKER_05]: you need one coat hanger per plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any bigger than that, we're going to need
little hanging lines from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use hemp twine and freaking hooks and
just put hooks in each end of the wall and
[SPEAKER_05]: run some twine across.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you guys may not have space.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fishing line works good too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fishing line is perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any kind of string to hang it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want them, you know, I've seen
guys take chicken wire and make a big
[SPEAKER_05]: cylinder out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way you got a bunch of hanging
spaces at different layers.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically what we do at the farm.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tomato cages work great too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recycle that tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a long time ago I harvested a
crop and dried it in the hydro hut that
[SPEAKER_05]: the crop grew in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just took out the light, flipped the crop,
hung it upside down right inside there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kept all the blowers going, kept the
carbon filter going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Worked very well.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I had the space to be able to do
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's moving.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Avoid the drying racks if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people were talking about those
online the other day when I was talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about drying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those put a dent in your, they make a flat
side on your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make it taste longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you start squishing the bud together
like that, you're messing up your
[SPEAKER_05]: trichomes and your flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trapping in air, trapping in
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trapping in moisture, which is what
we try to get out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Raise chance of mold.
[SPEAKER_13]: It centralizes a whole bunch of humidity.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've always felt the mesh damages the
bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shaking around and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to poke through the mesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you always end up with,
I have to put something underneath those
[SPEAKER_05]: to catch all the stuff that falls out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much that falls off.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always wonder what should I do with
this?
[SPEAKER_13]: Although that was a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know what to do with it now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I quit using those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you make B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure where you came from.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is useful for if you have gigantic
plants, all the larv and the little buds
[SPEAKER_13]: that you end up with inadvertently.
[SPEAKER_13]: It always seems like you have a pile of
that stuff, no matter how hard you try to
[SPEAKER_13]: fight it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be mad if you chop a bud in half on
your first trim session either.
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That always happens occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got the rooms built up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're wearing rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have everything done before you chop down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be scrambling around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really when I've seen a lot of
good crops go right up to the point where
[SPEAKER_05]: it's time to put scissors to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when somebody fucked them up or
right after you put scissors to it and
[SPEAKER_05]: trimmed it and then put it all on a
Tupperware while it was wet or hung it out
[SPEAKER_05]: too long to dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is where it counts, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've spent 60 days, 70 days on a
flowering crop, let's do the harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where the money happens.
[SPEAKER_13]: My aunt in a highly illegal state grew a
crop when I was younger and she didn't
[SPEAKER_13]: know how to handle any of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course there was no information.
[SPEAKER_13]: This was the 80s.
[SPEAKER_13]: She stuck it in a black trash bag and then
hung it in her basement.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were swamps in the area of the
country she lived in or not her basement,
[SPEAKER_13]: but her attic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And needless to say, it created a whole
bunch of mold.
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: A horrible waste of a summer's work,
especially in this locale.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Risk your life for moldy buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_13]: She was a crazy one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be a boy scout when it comes to growing
your crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should always be thinking two weeks
ahead in your pot plants, because anything
[SPEAKER_05]: you do today, you're not going to see it
for seven to 10 days probably.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything you've messed up on in the
season, here's your chance to make a
[SPEAKER_13]: little right of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess this is the time where we are
going to get the plants and harvest them,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should also branch out to dry trim and
wet trim a little bit before we get too
[SPEAKER_05]: far.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way I'm going to talk about how I
harvest a plant, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: hypothetically have a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to drag that three gallon pot
with my three foot tall pot plant over to
[SPEAKER_05]: a nice area where I've got plenty of
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to chop the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that I do it, I chop the plant
just above where the first nodes pop out
[SPEAKER_05]: so that I don't have a lot of stick
hanging off the edge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chop that.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unnecessary water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flip the plant upside down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use a fuzzy stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a pipe cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wrap that bitch right around those
bottom two nodes so that I got a nice
[SPEAKER_05]: hanger and I leave some hanging off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I tied that onto wherever it's
going to hang from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different situations at this point,
I hang in different areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see, I'm using my main dry room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hang it from the dry line that hangs
up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I myself dry trimmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got a plant that's been flushed,
de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_05]: My rooms are clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's going properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I've just got this giant wet plant
that is mostly little leaves and just
[SPEAKER_05]: donkey dick buds hanging upside down in my
dry room.
[SPEAKER_05]: The temps are perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now if we were going to wet trim,
this is where a wet trim and dry trim
[SPEAKER_05]: would branch off a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to keep everybody on the same
page.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we go too fast because we've
done all this and sometimes people are
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you skipped like four days worth of
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to keep it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going to wet trim,
the difference between wet trim and dry
[SPEAKER_05]: trim is obviously you let your plants dry
if you're going to dry trim and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: get in there and take the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wet trim, you would do it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to hang it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time to get in there and chop
everything off.
[SPEAKER_13]: You trim it into the bud that's going to
be smoked at this point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to go as close as you look
like you want to because those little
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves are going to shrink up into the bud
a little, but still do a hell of a good
[SPEAKER_05]: job getting in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse said earlier, I definitely prefer
dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse and I agree that we say dry
trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: We agreed earlier that some of those
southern states we're talking about with a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of humidity, you guys may want a wet
trim because you need to get those leaves
[SPEAKER_05]: off of there and kind of speed up that dry
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Colorado, there's not a lot of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it gets super dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We leave those leaves on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to talk mostly about dry
trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wet trim is basically I cut the buds off
of the stick store.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good hand size bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to hold onto just a stem and then I
spin that bud in my hand and just slowly
[SPEAKER_05]: clip off all of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can trim it to your preference if it's
going to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're trying to put it to market,
you got to trim that shit close.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to look good.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's not a lot of trichome on that
leaf, take it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that leaf is sticking out, take it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not leaf heads, we're pot heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to smoke pot, not leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's basically wet trim.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some patients that they don't want
it trimmed at all with their old tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess you should leave it on the
sticks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave it kind of on the sticks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't cut it into two smaller parts
because you need a way to hang it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how the branch is a branch and
then there's a little node coming off
[SPEAKER_05]: where your buds grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say one of those little branch parts has a
little hook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can hang that in your dry room
because after you get done trimming these
[SPEAKER_05]: buds, you want to hang them up so they
don't get a flat spot in your cure rack or
[SPEAKER_05]: your dry rack.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want them hanging.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trim them up, hang them up,
and then let those dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those wet buds need to dry after they've
been trimmed until you grab them and bend
[SPEAKER_05]: the stick and the stick should pop and
snap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should just go crack right on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be obvious when it happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on where you are,
that should take between five to maybe 15
[SPEAKER_05]: days just depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_13]: They dry from the outside in.
[SPEAKER_13]: The outside of the bud is going to be dry
before the entire bud is actually dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So don't get too happy and jump the gun
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really going to make a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just slightly wet buds to dry buds to
properly cured buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jesse's learning how to use a straw
here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cough wasn't that impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: The look on his face was like,
did I just cough from a straw?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did, bro.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wet trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about dry trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, dry trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hang the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people chopping the branch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about a three gallon pot here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd hang the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people chop it into smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can get it into just branches,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to let the whole thing hang.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it dries up just the right
speed here just because of where we are.
[SPEAKER_13]: For indoor plants, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're growing those big outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to chop them into smaller
parts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Outdoor plants with three levels and cages
around them.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not really an option.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even get out of the cage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I told somebody to cut down the
whole plant and they said, I grow a scrog.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are going to have to cut out
branches.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll just go with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go, we've got a bunch of branches
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're cutting off one branch at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hang those.
[SPEAKER_05]: They dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: However long it takes, just kind of sort
of similar to the wet trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to let them hang until right
before they snap.
[SPEAKER_05]: When that first part snaps, now it's time
to get to work because your stuff's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to dry slowly and you're going to catch
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get a little behind in
trimming, but you'll catch up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially if you got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had that thousand watt light created.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the 52 ounces.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: One ounce per week is all we need.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a flashback to an old episode.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys remember that because I
got where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got these dried plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You chop your plants down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hung them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You let them dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you've cut off a stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to your drying area and you got your
stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much just take your thumbs and just
knock those little dried leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put them, get a little container and have
that where you can just knock the leaves
[SPEAKER_05]: right into that container.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you're going to make some sort of
concentrates out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or food or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: With your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_05]: With your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your gloves on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to eat your skin flakes and
your fingernail dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got these buds and I kind of hold
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of, I'm just picturing the way I do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like I'm playing Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my thumbs just going and I'm just
knocking leaves off.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like he's playing snake on a
Nokia phone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you're texting on the
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just holding that thing and
just knock the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even have to, you can see what
you want to take off once it's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trim it to your preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: These little triangle leaves that stick
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually trimming this bud that's
sitting on the table with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: These little triangle leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just pluck those right off and
then pluck that off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see where the bud is and where
the leaf ends if you've done it right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I use scissors, but it's the exact same
process.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some strains, a curl scout, cookies and
yeti.
[SPEAKER_13]: No scissors necessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just roll that around in your hand and
those dried leaves fall right off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, so these dried nuggets,
they're pretty much dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I throw those in a bin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I'm done, I jar them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of where the cure process
starts for both of these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once those sticks are snapping on your wet
trim, take the leaves off, throw it in a
[SPEAKER_05]: bin and they're ready to go into jars when
you're done trimming everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dry trim, now that you've knocked the
leaves off, you got that in a bin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're ready to pretty much go into
jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of where the curing
process would start, don't you think?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we skipped anything?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure we have, but I'm really stoned.
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to get into curing on this
episode?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got 35, 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to get into the cure or do we
want to save that for another time?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let's do a little homework on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, we're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Jesse for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to hang out and leave the mics
on for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything you want to say while
we're on there?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: High burn.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll even admit it that I had to have been
told that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to keep you out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: High burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: We both want to save that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have this, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even going to explain it on the
air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Attention deficit disorder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stuck in the old school.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like talking about certain things,
but there's no reason not to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to keep the family life and
the podcast life separate.
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're saying hi to the lady at the hydro
store.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, really, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: You make the shows, people listen when you
come.
[SPEAKER_05]: They feel like you're an authority and you
remind me of shit that I would skip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that cracks me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I told you we're getting close to
1500 listeners per episode?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This little podcast from this little town
is actually making a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're helping people make quality
medicine, dude, and that's what my goal
[SPEAKER_05]: was.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here's something I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get a dab going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, would you pass me the new dabs,
the golden goat?
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: These dabs are the craziest looking dabs
you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he tipped it when he was putting
it onto the thing, so it's got this ripple
[SPEAKER_05]: look to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really neat.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like the floor of a golden pool
or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see a rapper wearing a shirt with
this print on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a slick Rick sort of look to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I could see a couple of wooks staring at
that for a couple of hours on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some kind of substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, that's the Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about your hash,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up, homies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Big love to everybody at the Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to give, while I'm thinking about
it, a special, special super shout out to
[SPEAKER_05]: my friend Doug Benson and also
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the time of our lives Monday night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to brag too much,
but look at the Facebook pages and the
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagrams and the Twitters.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like 100 pictures of me smoking
and dabbing with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you guys don't even know.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know the stories you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's cool as hell.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, CustJar.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something you need to bring up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, I even just stopped myself from
saying fuck.
[SPEAKER_13]: CustJar.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is only a rule that applies to me,
but if the guests want to participate,
[SPEAKER_05]: they can.
[SPEAKER_05]: The CustJar, if I say the F word,
the F word is the only one that counts in
[SPEAKER_05]: this CustJar.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I say the F word, you guys tweet me and
remind me every time I say it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast, starting on episode 30,
that's this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go back in time and cost me money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time from now forward that I say the
F word on a show, it costs me a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a few episodes, if I don't quit
saying the F word, I will increase my
[SPEAKER_05]: donation amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll crank it up to $5.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not committing to any amount of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see how I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: The worse I do, the more money I have to
pay because it'll hurt me more.
[SPEAKER_05]: A dollar doesn't hurt my feelings,
but it reminds me.
[SPEAKER_05]: $5, you go, damn, that was $5.
[SPEAKER_05]: $10, you start going, this is getting
expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to increase it slowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a charity that I have in mind that
I will tell you who it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a friend on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a long conversation and he does
deserve the donations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a person who needs help.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sick child, so we will help that
kid out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I say the F word, here's a buck
for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a dollar coming your way just to
get it started.
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes me want to make you cuss.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of a smart ass way to do it,
but it cost me a dollar and it was well
[SPEAKER_05]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to send this guy a dollar for a sick
child.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll still occasionally cuss.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start charging the guest a
dollar too, just for that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can say that one all you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of rambling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a big dab here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I owe a huge shout out to my man Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate my brand new blue
highly educated carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that stylish, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to do that actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to wrap up this part right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, that pretty much wraps up
episode 30, mostly wraps up the outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to send a huge thank you to Jesse
for taking time out of his grow schedule
[SPEAKER_05]: to come and help us out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like the listeners really
appreciate that, so much respect and much
[SPEAKER_05]: love to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you guys follow him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at jessiegrowsog on Twitter and
jessiegrows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_05]: search for iGrowCulture, find the review
section, and give me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_05]: After that, type in a comment and let me
know what you think of the show,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll also read all the Stitcher comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stitcher just recently updated,
and it is a lot easier for me to find the
[SPEAKER_05]: comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So go to Stitcher, leave your comments
there, give me a five-star review,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I will read your comments from
Stitcher as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I like good reviews and good
ratings is because that helps us move up
[SPEAKER_05]: in the ranks, which gets us seen by more
listeners, which gets more people growing
[SPEAKER_05]: quality product, which gets less shit
product out on the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can improve everybody's garden by
making the podcast a little more popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode

[SPEAKER_05]: Task Rock hooked me up with this blue,
highly educated, carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Helps out a lot once you get those low
temp dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also want to give him a shout out for this
nail I've got on my rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a highly educated duality nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my favorite nails.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what I use the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not sponsored by Hitman,
but this Hitman rig right here,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's probably the rig I grab first when
it's time to take dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also sitting next to me, I got a backup
plan in case it gets dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the Mad Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Mad Rob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support Mad Rob Glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any specific glass sponsors,
so I can say all their brand names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Solomon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solomon made me a ... I still remember
when I said that S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solomon made me a great Rasta color rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really dig that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to turn down the music.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the music is going to fade
out itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make sure we don't play any
more songs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Need to give a big shout out to the Mystic
Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're listening to is the Doggy Dub
from the album Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big huge shout out to Coot Dogg and
Catherine, some of the coolest people in
[SPEAKER_05]: reggae.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get down to business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to fade this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fade that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more music.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it so much easier for me to think
and do a show when there is no music going
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dab worked, y'all.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I told you I had a lot of
good news going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can get my web browser to open,
I will read the great news for the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Realm of Caring announces
Charlotte's Web to be shipped to all 50 US
[SPEAKER_05]: states.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, I owe a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody tweet me and remind me that I owe
another dollar to that charity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Realm of Caring announces Charlotte's Web
to be shipped to all 50 US states.
[SPEAKER_05]: Charlotte's Web is a kind of popular
strain of cannabis that's really high in
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD, and they're going to ship it to all
50 states?
[SPEAKER_05]: That already makes you raise your eyebrows
and say WTF?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm going to try to quit coughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh look, I have a Gatorade down here that
I've spaced out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take a sip of this because
dude, I'm choking.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so families of Realm of
Caring's out of state wait list received
[SPEAKER_05]: emails this week that Charlotte's Web Hemp
Oil will now be available for shipping to
[SPEAKER_05]: all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I find weird here, I'm going to
have to do more research.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Charlotte's Web Hemp Oil has got
the little trademark symbol right above
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they've trademarked Charlotte's Web
Hemp Oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The email from Realm of Caring,
which will now be referred to as ROC,
[SPEAKER_05]: explains that Charlotte's Web product they
will be shipping falls within the
[SPEAKER_05]: federally acceptable limit of less than
0.3% of THC for classification as a
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp-derived food product.
[SPEAKER_05]: The email also states that the legality of
this product is still ambiguous and
[SPEAKER_05]: recommends the patient sign up for their
state's medical marijuana programs to
[SPEAKER_05]: provide your family more protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the organization will ship to
patients who have signed up for the wait
[SPEAKER_05]: list regardless of their home state's
cannabis policies and regardless of each
[SPEAKER_05]: individual client's status as a licensed
medical cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they found a loophole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there is less than 0.3% THC in
the Charlotte's Web cannabis oil that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're making.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me call it the right thing because
they've trademarked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to say it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to scroll back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the hell did it go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Charlotte's Web Hemp Oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right there in the very first
sentence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I scrolled down way too far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're going to ship it to all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means people in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick a state that you're afraid of.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in a state right now and
cannabis is not legal there, you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: this product shipped to you if you were on
their waiting list.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how long ago you had to sign
up to get on the waiting list,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you were there, you can get this
product now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find that remarkable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find that quite ballsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ballsy is the word I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it really compassionate and I
really hope this works out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this helps a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give some credit before I get too
far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot to give credit to where this
article came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says photo by, let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's by Vanessa Waltz,
medical news and editorial.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I should have prepared a little
better for that part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it gives photo credit to Vanessa
Waltz and I'm pretty sure that the article
[SPEAKER_05]: is from her also.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was tweeted to me by my friend on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up white Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for tweeting that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's Nikon and NemoPunk on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure which is which.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either at Nikon or at NemoPunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, let's just be diligent and go look
at that for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I promise I'll get back into the
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to give Mike credit because he
hooked me up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was really something I was glad to
see because we see all kinds of bad news
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time.
All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see some great shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going through as quick as I can on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Nikon, N-I-C-O-N, but he has at
NemoPunk15, at N-E-M-O-P-U-N-K-15.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give him a shout out for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell him that you appreciate hearing his
story that he sent me on the news here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to scroll back down.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost of the oil will be $250 per
bottle, which is equal to five cents per
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are pros and cons of the new
development.
[SPEAKER_05]: And an explanation of why it's likely to
be quite different than the R-S-H-O CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: debacle.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got a link to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to check out the R-S-H-O
CBD debacle.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to read that link also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Open link in new tab and open link in new
tab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to read those also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rambling because I took a couple of
dabs and I just wanted to get this news
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike sent me this and I just wanted to get
on the mic and read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So according to ROC, the oil will test at
a consistent 30 to one ratio and the THC
[SPEAKER_05]: will be lower than the 0.3% allowed for
food products under federal law.
[SPEAKER_05]: While naysayers may question why this is
any more legal than R-S-H-O's products,
[SPEAKER_05]: it is critical to remember that R-S-H-O
has been tested numerous times by
[SPEAKER_05]: independent laboratories, finding contents
in excess of 1% THC, which is undeniably
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal under federal law and in
non-Federal law.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can only hope that ROC's testing and
quality control will be far more reliable
[SPEAKER_05]: than R-S-H-O's based on ROC's established
track record with products already
[SPEAKER_05]: available in Colorado and California.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is likely to be the case,
although maintaining a consistent ratio of
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 to one will undoubtedly be challenging
for the company's growers and extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So guys, I've been seeing a lot of
initials here, this R-S-H-O.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go see what that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: R-S-H-O, not a normal reaction to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a product that shows a bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like nature's supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some in a syringe, like an oral
syringe, and then there's some in a
[SPEAKER_05]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 18% CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to read just this little quick
article that comes from, I'll give you
[SPEAKER_05]: some credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wrote it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like another Vanessa Waltz
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the wake of reports of serious
gastrointestinal effects from the real
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a controversial product and people
are claiming nausea, vomiting,
[SPEAKER_05]: diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are saying that's a normal effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't argue that from taking this
product, from saying if that's a good
[SPEAKER_05]: effect or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another competing product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to go back to the
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make sure we knew what
that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I said the CBD debacle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I clicked that link.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what that's about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another, go figure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another Vanessa Waltz article.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just another article about
marketing CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to see a lot of that stuff
because it's going to get really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really popular, or it is getting really,
really popular apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the feds coming down with ROC,
oh, as far as the feds coming down on ROC
[SPEAKER_05]: with a question mark, that's actually a
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're supposed to say it like,
as far as the feds coming down on ROC,
[SPEAKER_05]: that would be an extremely poor PR move on
the federal government's part.
[SPEAKER_05]: With all the hype generated by Sanjay
Gupta's CNN specials and the widespread
[SPEAKER_05]: media coverage on CBD, a federal crackdown
on Charlotte's web would cause a huge
[SPEAKER_05]: uproar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the feds surely know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arresting and prosecuting the
self-proclaimed Christian CBD providers
[SPEAKER_05]: from ROC would spur an entirely different
public response than the arrest and
[SPEAKER_05]: prosecution of RSHOs leaders, many of whom
have already faced charge.
[SPEAKER_05]: As for the negative side, the most basic
and critical flaw is that 30 to one oil is
[SPEAKER_05]: unlikely to help most epileptic children.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anecdotal reports from Colorado families
using the higher ratio of Charlotte's web,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is reportedly tested as high as 48
to one CBD to THC, indicate that their
[SPEAKER_05]: children are either switching to other
products to maintain seizure control or
[SPEAKER_05]: supplementing Charlotte's web with higher
THC products available through Colorado's
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_05]: This THC supplementation, in addition to
mail order, Charlotte's web is a viable
[SPEAKER_05]: option for children in other medical
states who have previously been unable to
[SPEAKER_05]: find consistent sources of clean,
well-tested CBD products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in non-medical states, it is certainly
easier to find THC for supplementation in
[SPEAKER_05]: the underground black market than it is to
find CBD oils or clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I was thinking about that the
whole time I was reading this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about that entourage effect we've
talked about so many times?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to get that whole myriad of CBD,
THC, THCV.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the terpenoids that we're
missing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of it does it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're saying that they're actually
trying, they're needing to supplement with
[SPEAKER_05]: some higher THC products because the CBD
is not working completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably helping.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like any medication that you
would take or anything new you would
[SPEAKER_05]: introduce to your body, the first few
times you consume or take that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to notice a stronger
reaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after anything, a few times,
a few times, you're going to quit feeling
[SPEAKER_05]: as strong of an effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm pretty sure that the CBD does work
for a while, maybe for a long time for
[SPEAKER_05]: some people, maybe forever for some,
but some people, you're going to need that
[SPEAKER_05]: THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've repeated and rambled about
that long enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me wrap up the last paragraph here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In short,
[SPEAKER_05]: this should be a positive step in the war
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottom line is that more patients will
soon be able to access CBD rich oil
[SPEAKER_05]: without having to move to realm of caring
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This lady seems to know what she's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want somebody to follow cool
on Twitter, I don't know if she has a
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter account, let's read about her.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little article about Vanessa
Waltz.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanessa Waltz is a writer, artist and
marijuana reform advocate living in New
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: She graduated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check her out, dude, Vanessa Waltz.
[SPEAKER_05]: She seems to have a good head on her
shoulders when it comes to marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing we got to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to quit saying marijuana and say
cannabis all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kept reading the word marijuana and
now it's in my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, one brand only, Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's hoarding this screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got Charlotte's Web or high CBD
medicine, share that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow clones of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in a legal state, cut a lot of
clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever you cut clones, get to your plant
count, cut that many clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give those out.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have extras, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm thinking too many thoughts at
once right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to do a show and ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've got clones of CBD medicine,
put those out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't want these companies
taking over all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we want a company in charge of
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't seem... That's why most of us
are smoking medical cannabis anyways,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we don't want a company getting
rich off of us or a company telling us
[SPEAKER_05]: what we can and cannot consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to move on to the next
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm ranting, super dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to quit getting so high on these
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my show and I'll get high if I want
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: This article, remember a little while
back, we talked about a police officer who
[SPEAKER_05]: gave out a whole bunch of tickets,
66 citations in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the main guy giving out all the pot
tickets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We gave him the big middle finger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another article that came from
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: The credit goes to the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says Seattle's police chief has asked
the city to seek dismissal of all
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana citations issued by the bicycle
officer who wrote 80% of the tickets
[SPEAKER_05]: handed out during the first half of this
year for using pot in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seattle Times reports that chief Kathleen
O'Toole said Friday, the request to the
[SPEAKER_05]: city attorney's office stems from a
conclusion that the 66 citations were
[SPEAKER_05]: written as part of the officer's personal
agenda.
[SPEAKER_05]: O'Toole says the tickets were written for
the wrong reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bicycle officer wrote 66 of the 83
such tickets issued in the first half of
[SPEAKER_05]: the year of the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: This dude wrote 66 of 83 tickets in the
first half of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in six months, every month this dude
busted, wrote 11 tickets for people
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The officer wrote on one citation that he
used a coin toss to decide which of two
[SPEAKER_05]: men got the ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on another described state voter
approval of marijuana legalization as
[SPEAKER_05]: silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote on the citation that he used a
coin to decide which two guys got the
[SPEAKER_05]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can cops get away with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote it on the ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to make him not count now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to say, ha ha, your tickets
don't count.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be a big middle finger if
the authorities gave the authority a big
[SPEAKER_05]: middle finger like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Times says the officer has apologized
to O'Toole.
[SPEAKER_05]: She is reportedly still considering
disciplinary action.
[SPEAKER_05]: The city attorney Pete Holmes' spokeswoman
Kimberly Mills says Holmes will review the
[SPEAKER_05]: chief's request.
[SPEAKER_05]: Initiative 502 approved by Washington
voters included a civil fine for public
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of got some people on our side
because they let that cop, they may let
[SPEAKER_05]: that cop's tickets slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scrolling through to the next article.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were talking about in Denver about
banning BHO extraction and banning certain
[SPEAKER_05]: types of extractions without being in a
licensed facility or what they would call
[SPEAKER_05]: a MIPS, I think that is to be a little
more accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm checking too many things on the
computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The video is going, the recording is
going, and I'm on the right website.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, we're golden tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: For as many dads as we took, this is
working out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this says some exemptions and proposed
Denver restrictions on making home hash
[SPEAKER_05]: oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it says alcohol-based extraction
process would join water and food-based
[SPEAKER_05]: methods as acceptable in Denver city
council committee's planned ordinance.
[SPEAKER_05]: This article is by John Murray from the
Denver post.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says Denver city council committee
Tuesday delayed proposed restrictions on
[SPEAKER_05]: home hash oil production so that they
could be amended to accommodate residents
[SPEAKER_05]: who use an alcohol-based process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, shit's falling over on the table
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even sure what's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Several people argued for the change to
the safety and wellbeing committee,
[SPEAKER_05]: including the father of a little girl who
depends on cannabis oil to treat her
[SPEAKER_05]: severe epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee will resume the discussion
on the proposed ordinance or could vote
[SPEAKER_05]: October 16th on whether to send it to the
full council.
[SPEAKER_05]: The proposal would ban the amateur use of
butane or other gases and extractions of
[SPEAKER_05]: oil for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's resulted in dozens of home
explosions statewide this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Licensed businesses still could use that
process, but people who make hash oil at
[SPEAKER_05]: home would have to use safe water and
food-based methods.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to have two different
effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, people do shit that's illegal
anyway, so I don't think that people are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to make it a little
sketchier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that's going to cause more people
sneaking around doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to do it in a little more
sketchy place, which means you're a little
[SPEAKER_05]: more enclosed, which is the dangerous part
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I think it's going to make the
street value of BHO dabs go up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And already right now, dabs are getting
kind of hard to find around here and the
[SPEAKER_05]: prices are going up really high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because they're making rules like
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want some uneducated dude next
door in his garage making hash while I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: sitting here trying to record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the next door house blowing
up and screwing up all of our lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess it's kind of, you know,
the adult in me, the parent in me,
[SPEAKER_05]: the freaking smart guy says we should not
be blasting like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we got to get the shops or we got
to figure out a way that we can get some
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of private caregivers to be able to
blast it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we build our own rooms, if I have OSHA
come and build me a blast safe room,
[SPEAKER_05]: can I make it in there then maybe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there has to be some kind of
exception because the shops are charging
[SPEAKER_05]: way too much right now for shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it, it's shit to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't dab a lot of the hash that I've
seen come from the shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a little bit of a hash nub to tell
you the truth, but I don't want to dab a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here, let me show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a camera going here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, I'll post some pictures of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of working on putting up YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: This got hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me switch to the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: This got hot in the car, but this is some
golden goat shatter right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be nice and stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't be goopy, soupy and poopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to contradict myself by
showing you some live resin that is a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit gooey, but this is a different
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not marketing this as shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is live resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how golden and clear that is,
brah?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just, we've talked about live
resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fresh frozen, butane blasted buds
done in a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the guy that did it for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I should say his name on
the show right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit's golden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really golden looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the shops are charging too much for
doodoo and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have to let the artists,
the extract artists that know what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing, the people that kind of led this
movement, the guys that make everything
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm adjusting a camera over here
while I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys that have evolved all this hash
stuff, they've done the research,
[SPEAKER_05]: they've done the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be able to do it in a safe
manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that open blasting is not a
safe manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if this is, let's see,
is this going to have anything to do with
[SPEAKER_05]: the guys with the closed loop system?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to scroll through this article
one quick time and see, would ban amateur
[SPEAKER_05]: use of propane or other gases and
extraction of oil from, yeah, that fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: says closed loop system or not,
I think, in the way that that's worded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have to be careful
because I know a few guys that have
[SPEAKER_05]: invested in a closed loop system thinking
that that would solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now look, they're changing the rules
right around you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm going to get back into the
article.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says Brian Wilson, whose family moved
from New Jersey to Denver earlier this
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So his three-year-old daughter,
Vivian, could use medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments, said neither of those methods
will produce the kind of oil suitable for
[SPEAKER_05]: her.
[SPEAKER_05]: He uses an ethanol-based extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't move out here to put her at more
risk, Wilson said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Denver Fire Chief Eric Tade told the
committee that the proposal likely could
[SPEAKER_05]: be amended to allow alcohol-based methods
with limits on use of heat and amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol to keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, I don't like rules and stuff,
but I don't like fires and explosions
[SPEAKER_05]: either.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have a choice, a couple of rules or a
couple of fires, the Rastafari in me says,
[SPEAKER_05]: fuck the rules, I owe a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other part of me says,
I don't like fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me explain why I keep saying that I
need a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not a common listener,
what's a regular listener, what's the
[SPEAKER_05]: phrase for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, regular listener, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I say the F word, I owe a
dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a charity, there's a guy,
he's not a charity, it's a sick person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sick child that will get my dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I say the F word, you guys have
to tweet me, tell me when I said it,
[SPEAKER_05]: tell me how many times in this episode I
said it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts on episode 30, this is 31,
so you got two episodes where you can make
[SPEAKER_05]: some money off me.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a couple episodes, if I don't stop
saying the F word, I'm going to increase
[SPEAKER_05]: the dollar amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go from a dollar, then I'll be like,
all right, now I'm going to, not now,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying this, but hypothetically in
the future, I'll start charging myself $5
[SPEAKER_05]: for every time I say the F word.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if I still don't stop,
I'll charge 10 bucks and then it's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to start costing me money and money
counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to say the F word on the
show and I don't want to pay money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to work together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rambly tonight, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I got behind the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got this cool news about people sending
CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want your comments about the CBD oil
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tweet me that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take a drink right quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys give me, give me a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even going to edit this part.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: This article, I said I had good news.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one isn't the greatest of news,
but it's news.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, it's from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't give a reporter a name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, seven people are now named as
plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit
[SPEAKER_05]: against the company accused on giving
people samples of marijuana lace chocolate
[SPEAKER_05]: at the Denver County fairs pot pavilion,
which was supposed to be drug free.
[SPEAKER_05]: The suit filed August 25th in Denver
district court by law firm, Frescona,
[SPEAKER_05]: Joyner, Goodman, and Greenstein alleges
that representatives of beyond Broadway
[SPEAKER_05]: LLC doing business as both full melt
chocolate and live well handed out the
[SPEAKER_05]: chocolate on August 1st through third.
[SPEAKER_05]: The suit is open to all people served THC
chocolates by beyond Broadway LLC at the
[SPEAKER_05]: fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we talked about this a little while
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a pot pavilion at the Denver
County fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a joint rolling contest where
actually they rolled oregano instead of
[SPEAKER_05]: rolling pot, but they had a joint rolling
contest.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually had a pot growing
competition off site where people had to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow their pot and then people would go
look at it somewhere else because they
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't want it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were not supposed to bring any pot
products to this fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what was supposed to happen,
but a full melt handed out some chocolate
[SPEAKER_05]: bars and people ate them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seven people are now named as
plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit
[SPEAKER_05]: against these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine, and we had this talk a little
while back on the show, but imagine if you
[SPEAKER_05]: were not a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you listening to the show may not
be pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you may be amateur pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you I know only have smoked a
little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you can only smoke very
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you eat a hundred milligram edible,
you're going to get really high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So imagine if you went to the fair and
you're just hanging out and someone's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you want to try this chocolate,
man?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, they have weed in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, I believe you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You work for this company and you've got
the apron on that says the company and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're behind the booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you eat the chocolate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably 45 minutes later, you're just
shit in your pants because you're too
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, imagine that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to try to drive home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the weird part of the head trip of it,
in my opinion, is you don't realize that
[SPEAKER_05]: you ate something that was going to make
you feel intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you're like tripping a little bit
because you're high, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're starting to feel whatever,
whatever, whatever comes on first.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the tingles in your arms and then
things are a little funny and you start
[SPEAKER_05]: giggling, but you don't know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, but now you really don't know
why because you didn't realize you ate
[SPEAKER_05]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're like, I'm retarded now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think you just fucking your brain is
flipping out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I own another dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get me on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, shout out to dreadful J.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up mama?
[SPEAKER_05]: You remind me every time I say the F word
and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep those Instagram pictures coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys follow dreadful J on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a bad ass woman.
[SPEAKER_05]: She makes some good hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's an awesome lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check her out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but imagine you just be tripping,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just be, and you'd have to,
what if you had your kids with you?
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you're with your mom and what if
you have a job?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what if you have a job dude,
where they drug test you?
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you were a reporter that was on
the clock?
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this could have caused a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we shouldn't talk too much about it
because I guess there's a court case and
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody could hear what I'm saying and be
like, yeah, that is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize that I owe another
goddamn dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be an expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so seven people are going to make a
lot of money off of a full male chocolate
[SPEAKER_05]: and live well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so be careful if you ever go to a fair
or an event and they're handing out
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis chocolates and you're a
lightweight or you're not aware of what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're getting as carefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I guess if you get the wrong
shit, see the hell out of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably wouldn't if I wouldn't,
if you did it to me, but if you gave my
[SPEAKER_05]: daughter a medicated chocolate and told
her that it was a regular chocolate,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's I'm definitely, you're going to,
yeah, there's going to be at least a court
[SPEAKER_05]: case.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be against me from me reacting to
that shit, but hopefully I can maintain
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'll do it properly and just see the
shit out of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh guys, I've been rambling for,
let's see, let's go look at a clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how long I've been going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I, uh, I might have to pee here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do it coming right up on 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to fade out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back and we'll do another segment
right after this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to dab and use the little boy's
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for listening to me ramble a lot
tonight guys, video watchers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know what I'm going to do for
this part.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just keep the video rolling and we'll
figure it out in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right guys, I am back while I was
gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned on the email and I grabbed myself
a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I'm going to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of the email, let's take a big
fat hit out of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using my blue highly educated carb
cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to clean this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, keep your carb, carb cap clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will help you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dropping it onto the infinity nail with an
email wrapped around it off of an old
[SPEAKER_05]: school rig that I like this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's sturdy enough to hold up the
email.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I use this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big fat dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need to be able to talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do a little one on the
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed that dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've mentioned a couple of times that
I'm doing a video on this episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to go through all of the old
episodes and just make really cheesy
[SPEAKER_05]: iMovie videos so that they can be up on
YouTube so that people that don't have an
[SPEAKER_05]: iPhone or don't have Stitcher or whatever,
who are more simple and more familiar with
[SPEAKER_05]: the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it'll just give us another way to be
listened.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to throw the show up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be really simple videos at first.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll learn how to make better videos as
time goes by.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first few will be cheesy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise you the first two are goofy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made them last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Might've been medicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Might've been really medicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been taking dabs of this golden goat
and you can't sleep after you dab this
[SPEAKER_05]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just got to open your computer and
just go nuts because you don't really want
[SPEAKER_05]: to do anything important when you're that
dabbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm recording this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just staring into my MacBook with the
camera going and just recording me.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're checking it out right now,
I may just post that to YouTube,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you got 30 episodes to figure that one
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be up there eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might, I might go out of order.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to jump on here and record
because I got that really cool tweet about
[SPEAKER_05]: that article that Mike sent me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to talk about the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course I am the guy from I read genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have been asking me when
will certain things be back in stock in
[SPEAKER_05]: nature's green remedies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're sold out because I'm sold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys clean me the heck out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise you I'm working on more stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got more grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a little bit of grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that does, that one doesn't make a lot
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's harder to get seeds out of that one
than a lot of the others.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'd be a lot of bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'd be a lot of Capelton.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a little bit of heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be some Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be a little bit of night nurse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a lot of what I make goes to the
people around here before it makes it to
[SPEAKER_05]: nature's green remedies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes to other places before it gets
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I, I take care of the locals first.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take care of the people around me,
my patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys get the seeds first.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I make.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I put what I have on nature's
green remedies when they order from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I let them know when I have stuff,
they'll order it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and then they'll put it on the website
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's going to be honestly coughing and
counting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking about probably 75 to 90
days ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to make any huge promises and
there should be some stuff on nature's
[SPEAKER_05]: green remedies, maybe a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say, because you know,
I need packaging time and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: drying time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, right around a hundred days,
there should be some stuff available from
[SPEAKER_05]: irie genetics again, and nature's green
remedies.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize for not being able to keep
them in stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's kind of a good sign that
they're sold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I'd be doing shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also I have a forum, uh, irie
genetics, colorado.com has a forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if you go to irie genetics,
colorado.com, you can check out our
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't run the website.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my buddy Tony.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a college student.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he's a working man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we put together the website later night
when we're chilling out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please support that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Join the forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have questions, we will answer your
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get some of the stuff from the show
comes from the forum and some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: from the show goes onto the forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a little way to be
interactive.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to participate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also speaking of participation,
you can follow us, please follow us,
[SPEAKER_05]: follow agro culture on Instagram,
Facebook, and Twitter, and also follow
[SPEAKER_05]: irie genetics on Facebook, Instagram,
and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, coming up in the future, I know we
said that we were going to do an episode
[SPEAKER_05]: about curing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Jesse and I are working on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to put together better episodes
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're taking our time and going slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this may just be like a midweek
booster episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of me hanging out dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was eager to get a show out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, man, I don't have a lot else to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to give a couple of shout outs,
a shout out to coo and cat and the entire
[SPEAKER_05]: mystic roots band.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you check out the mystic roots
band.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to task rock and highly
educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big super shout out to the entire garden
of Weedon crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to add miss green thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also a shout out to hippie nurse seven 10
and a shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to wrap up the show and we do
this part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_05]: search for the agro culture podcast,
find the review section, give me a five
[SPEAKER_05]: star rating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you want to give me a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_05]: What that does is that knocks me up higher
in the ranks.
[SPEAKER_05]: People see the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people listen to the show,
which moves me up higher into the ranks.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people see the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in turn, more of your friends get to
grow high grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people get educated the proper way
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people will quit believing bullshit
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: More people will know the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis will be freed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis will be legalized everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a small step for weed
[SPEAKER_05]: prevention.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a small step for weed prevention.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a small step for weed prevention.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you thought the show, if you listened
for this long, you probably liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you thought the show was totally
retarded and you think I'm an idiot,
[SPEAKER_05]: tell me, tell me what I'm doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll correct it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably don't give two shits because I
like the way the show goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you guys like it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a little stuff that I can fix,
I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's little stuff that you're like,
dude, that is so dumb or annoying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're like your dreadlocks are
dumb, you already know what my answer is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys that are listening this far,
you're not going to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you guys that are following me
listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got two different monitors I'm
looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it looks like I'm dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first time I tried to do an
actual thought out video.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another video, maybe episode 21
that it's goofy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really uncomfortable in that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting better at the podcasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm rambly, dabbed out,
kind of had some caffeine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it going on today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So leave your comments on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stitcher updated their page.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm burping on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stitcher updated their page and you can
leave comments a little more easily now
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can find your comments more easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: So leave your comments on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once again, let me the review.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I move up in the ranks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can legalize pot one step at a time,
one click at a time, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's our new, that's our new motto
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legalizing cannabis, one click at a time,
spread that shit around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody tweet me that because I'm going
to forget it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget that every episode is
available on iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: The show is available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The show is available on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to try to get all of the
episodes on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a huge commitment you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a lot of chunk of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And uploading an episode to YouTube,
it takes the computer all day to get it up
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes it fails after you do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the fun part of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I want to give a huge shout out to
my Ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here comes some Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana has a very distinct smell,
okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pass around just a little
tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want you all to take a smell so you
know when someone is smoking marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: near you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was episodes 28, 29, 30, and 31 of
what used to be known as the I Grow
[SPEAKER_05]: Culture podcast, currently known as the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
a really long episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please let me know what you think of these
long episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it worth my time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it worth your time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, it's at GFYHpodcast on the
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to email me, it's

[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to know what you think of
these long episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I don't want to make this file
much longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm rambling for no reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be back Monday with a brand new
episode with brand new content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to joining you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
I'll see you next time.
