[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy
these chunks of old episodes, so here we
[SPEAKER_00]: go with the Throwback Thursday episode of
the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 76 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a veteran
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even someone who's just curious about
the current state of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the song you're listening to is
The Doggy Dub, and it's off their album,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out and support
the Mystic Roots Band, and stay positive
[SPEAKER_00]: sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'll let you know that
while I'm recording the podcast today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am live on a new application called
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on Periscope are watching me live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got five live viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hear everything I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could not hear the theme song,
but they could hear everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to send comments that I can
see on the bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to pay attention to the
comments on Periscope while I record the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast today, but if this goes well in a
future episode, this may open up the doors
[SPEAKER_00]: for a questions and answer segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer them live on Periscope as I
record the podcast, and then in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, it won't be any more than... I'll
try to get it up as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after the live Q&A, I'll go ahead
and throw the podcast up into iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher, and then you guys can listen to
it again if you listen to it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Periscope app.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't already listen to it,
then you'll be able to hear the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: episode with questions from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to figure out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys check out this Periscope app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can log in and you can watch people
broadcast their lives, or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast your life if you'd feel like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going in the grow room and
walking around in the garden and showing
[SPEAKER_00]: people what I've got going on in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been driving around and throwing the
phone up on the dashboard just while I
[SPEAKER_00]: drive around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this show, you guys, I do plan on
talking about phenohunting and selective
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been teasing about
phenohunting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do that in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get that far though,
I do want to send a big happy birthday
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Maya Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Monkey Bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is now 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out on the 14th,
late, late at night on the 14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will hopefully listen to it on
the morning of the 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop it late on the 14th just
to say happy birthday to my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your daddy loves you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you're tired of hearing my
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day when you're old and you
listen back to all the episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll catch this one and it'll put a
smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dads think about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Maya Bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you so much more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, a couple of nights ago, my good
buddy Clint got me a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took along Clint's little brother,
Chris, and then we met up with our good
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, Joe, who will be on a future
episode of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up to Denver to ComedyWorks and we
saw Joey, Coco, Diaz, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucker blew the roof off of
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude ripped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best comedy shows I've
seen in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say that about every comedy show
when I come on this show, but it was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best shows I've seen in quite a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally kicked ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first six or seven minutes of the
show, he came out and he told a joke,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept telling jokes, but he told it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like he hit me and then I would
start laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I felt like I was going to
catch my breath, he'd hit me harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd laugh even harder and lose my
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I feel like I was coming
around, he'd hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was starting to get a pleasant pain
in my cheeks and stomach from laughing so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got this weird headache toward
the back of my head from laughing so
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Joey, stop for a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a little bit of oxygen because I
cannot breathe and I cannot keep up with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving the periscope camera right now
so that they can see me a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got everything I need on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Joey Coco Diaz is definitely one of my
favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan says he's the best comedian on
the planet right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost agree with that if you're
into that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can listen to Joey talk all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to his podcast, The Church of
What's Happening Now, and it's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big shout out to Joey Coco Diaz for
putting on an amazing fucking comedy show
[SPEAKER_00]: at ComedyWorks in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Baker and the
entire ComedyWorks crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker, I owe you one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever need anything, if you're ever
in Pueblo, make sure you get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will hook you up with any help you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks, I love that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it once or seven times,
the best fucking comedy club in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send a huge shout out to
Clint for the ticket and for being a hell
[SPEAKER_00]: of a good friend, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my homie forever, and I appreciate
it, and I see what you do, and you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: good friend, dude, and I just want to
throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out today, had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're always going to be my
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to Joe and Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, we killed it as a group at that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody whined about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe met us up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Clint and I all rode up
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was a little whiny girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a successful dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flirted with the beautiful waitress at
the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kicked ass at the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all met Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had a nice little smoke out in the
car before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, shout out to the crew for kicking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are not painting the asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were grown men, and I fucking love
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were all invited on the podcast
whenever you'd like to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I wrote a note, and I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to reach for a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down to give a shout out to a guy
who calls himself Beast of Omaha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Beast of Omaha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He follows me on Periscope, and we were
talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told him that I do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he was going to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the episode I did right after we
spoke, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I hope you were listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to get on to the main topic
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic of the show, you guys,
is going to be phenohunting and selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take a lot of notes because I
feel like I can pull that episode off
[SPEAKER_00]: without a lot of preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got all the preparation in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think I can pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one or two more things I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are my notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to announce something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to be really,
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a very long time ago, I was scrolling
through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry about the clearing of the
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke dabs and drink caffeine,
and then the throat goes to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, I was scrolling through
Instagram, and I came across an Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: page of a lovely lady called
DudeIt'sDamsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been following Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's tattooed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got dreadlocks, and she's fucking
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an amazing woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following Damsel on Instagram
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a good friend of mine,
our friend Hunt, the Grimy Gatsby,
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced me to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my friend Julia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give shouts to Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Jules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you, boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is partly responsible for introducing
me to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I got introduced to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spoken a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am proud to announce that I am
working on a strain for DudeIt'sDamsel,
[SPEAKER_00]: the suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a strain specifically selected
for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this strain will represent Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stand out from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be something you want to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will smell beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her idea is that when she smokes it,
she wants a nice giggly sativa head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm working on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several... The seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have several crosses that I think
would make Damsel happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of just running one cross,
I'm going to run three or four crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see if one of those
gives us a phenotype that Damsel
[SPEAKER_00]: completely loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is a great segue to get into the
main meat of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic of this podcast is pheno
hunting and selecting a mother plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to focus on pheno
hunting because I've already gone about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me head over to Google here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about the microphone bumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me head over to Google here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Damsel also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too far, I want to give a
huge shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow at
DudeIt'sDamsel on Instagram and let her
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you support her new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the hashtag, hashtag DamselsDank,
D-A-M-S-E-L-S-D-A-N-K, DamselsDank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag DamselsDank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her know that you follow iREGENetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow her on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the progress of the strain that
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start posting pictures soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, shout out to Damsel for giving me the
honor to grow a strain that will represent
[SPEAKER_00]: her forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I want to send a big,
huge shout out to my buddy, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Hunt, thanks for linking Damsel and I
up together to get this project started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure this is going to work out great
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this project is completed and Damsel
has picked her favorite phenotypes or
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, the strain should be available
for purchase in flower form at Green and
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs and
also the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that'll be a long time coming,
but once it's available, we will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to get that far, I'm going to have to
do a pheno hunt, which is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: main topic of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it feels like a good place to start
would be to define the word phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm headed over to Google and
Wikipedia says, a phenotype is the set of
[SPEAKER_00]: observable characteristics of an
individual resulting from the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: of its genotype with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, kind of what that says is,
if we have a bunch of seeds and we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them out and they are all the same
genotype, which means they came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same parents, they're the same batch of
seeds, if we grow those out, we will see
[SPEAKER_00]: what is called phenotypical expressions,
which means some of those plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to show characteristics of its mother,
some are going to show characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: its father, some are going to show
characteristics of grandparents that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even see in the parent plants,
and then some of them are going to show
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect traits of 50-50 combinations of
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to see variations in
between depending on which finial
[SPEAKER_00]: generation you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one way to kind of put that is,
if you have a brother or sister,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably don't look exactly alike
because you're from the same parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you are different phenotypes
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your brother is a little taller than
you or a little fatter than you or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just phenotypical expression of the
same genotype basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we're working with plants,
when we're looking for phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purpose of a phenohunt is to find the
plant that you want from that 10 pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you have a couple of decisions to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the plant that represents the
one that's on the picture of the package
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds, the one that you read about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that grows a little
bit shorter from your grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that's a little more
indica dominant, the one that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more sativa dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to think about when you
were starting a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the phenohunt is to run
through... See, I would recommend at least
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I do anywhere from 25 to 100
seeds of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the ideal thing is to run as many of
these seedlings as you can underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: same conditions to find the one that you
want that is the stellar keeper out of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I see people purchase a
package of seeds and they will run two of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds and then they'll say,
hey, look, I've got Sour Diesel or hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I've got Super Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might have a decent Super Lemon
Haze, but you don't have that super
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype because you haven't gone through
and done the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't phenohunted out the one that
is stellar, that is worth keeping,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to blow everybody else's
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a phenohunt is where you're going to
find a lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have gotten that stellar
keeper out of just a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you do a large phenohunt,
the chances of finding what you want and
[SPEAKER_00]: that stellar keeper, it's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's talk about a couple of really
popular phenotypes while we're on this
[SPEAKER_00]: subject before we get into me explaining
how I do my typical phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about
Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a really popular phenotype of
Jilly Bean known as the candy store
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also another phenotype known
as the orange phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The candy store phenotype smells like when
you walk into the candy store in the mall,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got that sweet, it's like those candy
hearts you buy at Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all smells real sugary and sweet and it
makes you want to eat candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the candy store phenotype
smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's of course why it's called candy
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange phenotype smells like a basket
of fucking oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are known phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you hear people talking about,
yeah, I got the orange phenotype or I got
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jilly phenotype, that's what they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed a strain called heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is the chunky girl phenotype,
which just grows big fat phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the mean girl,
which looks a little, she's real jagged
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way that her buds grow are real
spiky and pointy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I call her the mean girl just because
she looks angry when she grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great plant, but it looks
like ferocious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an intimidating plant for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the other phenome,
which is the non-desirable phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that's more golden goat
leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep that phenome when I grow
heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll toss that one out right away when I
identify it, but that's more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you hear us talking about like,
I've got the whatever phenome,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we're saying, that we grew out
a pack of seeds and we found the phenome
[SPEAKER_00]: that was known, that's been talked about a
lot, or that the breeder told you to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know that there are phenomes of
black cherry Kim that I tell the guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, I'm like, if you see that,
I wouldn't even keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just get rid of that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if you see this, that's kind of
the one you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're growing black cherry Kim,
the one that shows dark, dark purple right
[SPEAKER_00]: away, like a plum purple right away,
I don't think that's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows little tiny popcorn balls of
bright, dark, dark purple buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't find that to be a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as a pheno hunter, I know to throw
that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only know that because I've grown it
out so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm drifting a little bit away
from the topic, but it's all useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably get into explaining a
little bit how I do a pheno hunt or how I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend you doing a pheno hunt as
a kind of a new grower without a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: space and a lot of money to spend on
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the way to do it, I would get a 10
pack of seeds or a 12 pack if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are selling 12s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get about 10 seeds if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to run a pheno hunt
for yourself, 10 is enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get seeds from a reputable
company, from a reputable vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend stuff like Gage Green
Genetics, La Plata Labs, Irene Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sin City Seeds has shown me some great
shit lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Soura Seed Company has a great lineup
and a lot of great things to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great DNA genetics is
somebody who I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Dankness is somebody who I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of seed breeders out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys try to do some research,
get a reputable brand, give yourself a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some good seeds and give yourself a
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, get a good 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized or regulars, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we're going to do, we're going to
germinate all 10 seeds and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do everything exactly the
same to all 10 of these seeds for almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all of their lives until kind of
mid-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see that they need more water or
more nitrogen or more something in late
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, we'll make a note of that and then
we will keep that in mind when we select
[SPEAKER_00]: our keepers in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to germinate 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pay attention to them from
day one because you just want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a seed that's a straggler,
make a note of one that's a straggler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can label your seeds somehow,
like seed one, seed two, seed three,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, germinate these seeds, get them into
cups, grow them, take some pictures if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, about once a week if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we want to do is pay attention
to them really closely, veg them out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to take a clone of them as
soon as they're big enough to take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now you've got these little plants
that are probably in like one to three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots and you've probably taken a
couple of clones off of them, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to flower out the original
seed that you started or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that seedling as a mother plant or do
you want to keep one of the clones as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother and flower out that plant that's
already large?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a toss-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much space you have and
what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have learned is I like that
seedling mother to stay as my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, it has more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a good idea to keep that
one as your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that that one's
already grown and already big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not flower it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, from watching clones grow and
watching seed plants grow, I prefer to
[SPEAKER_00]: have my mother plant come from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be hypocritical because sometimes
time doesn't always allow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I need the space in the room to
bloom, so I bloom out the large plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's already going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from now on, I will try to keep that
seed plant as my original mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you got these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big enough to take a clone off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a couple of clones and then you
decide which one you want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're going to flower that
original mom, you put all 10 of those
[SPEAKER_00]: original seed moms into a flowering room
and you treat them all the exact same and
[SPEAKER_00]: you flower all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to do clones, all you have
to do is get the clones into pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them rooted and everything,
get them healthy, and then put those into
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll catch everything right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the same lesson now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is when you really have to start
paying attention and taking good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got males, you'll find out about
day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those out of there unless you plan on
breeding because those males are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll start causing you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the males out of there about day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're phenohunting for males,
that'll be a whole another episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even ready to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write it down, but I'm not sure that
that's going to happen for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenohunting males, that's going to be
neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really advanced lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be way up there in like the way
past episode 100, but we'll talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, pull out the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you want to take a lot of notes
because around week three, week four is
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're going to start seeing a lot of
different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something herms, you're probably going
to see that around between five and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep the hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you got a 10 pack, you're probably
going to get somewhere between four and
[SPEAKER_00]: six boys out of there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you pull those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you got like five more to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got fem seeds and probably you
lost one during germ, you only got nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now you probably got four or five
plants to work with, maybe six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with fems, you may still
have 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of them are going to be run team.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them be squatty or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to pull those squatty plants if
they're shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's healthy and not looking like a run
and a problem, keep it because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: run LA confidential, the shitty looking
plant is the one you want to keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not crappy looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the small, slow growing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant looks like a run,
you can go ahead and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to watch them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that fall over a lot,
if one attracts bugs or one attracts mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for nanners, like I said,
around week five or eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a hermaphrodite, get rid of
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, take a lot of pictures, smell them,
pay a lot of attention to how they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have to harvest all
10 of these plants or however many made it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said four to six, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, harvest all four to six of these,
trim them down, cure them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to episode number 35 about drying
and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry and cure your medicine properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all of your finished plants are dried
and cured, it's not time to do a few smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: samples on every phenotype that you've
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing it for just you,
you can smoke it and you can decide which
[SPEAKER_00]: one you like for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to be selling it or
giving it to medical patients or sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: it with your friends, it's a good idea to
pass out a few buds of each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't tell anybody which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just label it A or B and I'm like,
tell me which one you like better and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I send it off to a couple of my
patients, my buddy Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Doug?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I grow new plants, I don't
label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give them initials or a code word or
something and I'll take it to Doug and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like, smoke these, tell me which
ones we need to keep and which ones we
[SPEAKER_00]: should get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm his medical provider,
his opinion is a big influence on what I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also White Mike that's on the
podcast, Milky Trichomes, Nemopunk15,
[SPEAKER_00]: he does a lot of helping with my selection
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the grower, it's a lot up to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of it is up to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows like shit, if it grows 12 feet
tall in eight weeks and you're indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're under an eight foot ceiling,
that's not the phenotype for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows 32 feet wide in six weeks and
you're in a small room, that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows super completely lanky and
falls over and needs a thousand stakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to get one bud kind of Scrog
system, that might not be the one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the one that grows the way that
you want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that comes out to be the one
that smokes well also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is what I found as a
grower growing a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up with one that is
fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up with one that is
covered in resin and has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll probably have one that tastes
really, really good and you'll have one
[SPEAKER_00]: that harvests really, really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can find one that does all of
those, then you're golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can get two or three of those,
if you can get the good high and the good
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sacrifice that for weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cash cropper, maybe you want
to sacrifice the good flavor for the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a strain that does it all
for you, find that, get clones of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good phenol hunt, you have to take
clones because if you don't take clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you grow, you're going to end
up having the best weed on the planet one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and not have a clone of it and be so
pissed off at yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, that's the basics of a
phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, keep in mind that not all seeds
are going to yield the exact same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get the plants that you saw
in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get the plants that were
advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your goal is actually to find the one
that you love and keep that one around and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've got that one keeper,
you know what you can do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do another phenol hunt of 10
more seeds and find another keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's better than the other one that
you've got, then toss out that other one
[SPEAKER_00]: or do it until your mother room is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep hunting for keeper plants and
more keeper plants until you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: most stellar fucking lineup of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about keeping a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've grown this phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have found the plant that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the one that has the flavor you
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the high you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows well for your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you either took a clone of it or
you've got that remaining seed plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use as a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trick to keeping that plant as your
mother plant is to keep it under a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a 19-5 cycle for my mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 19 hours on, five hours off,
because I feel like this gives my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of light to keep them from trying
to auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more tropical strains will try to
auto flower if you let them go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: less light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 19-5, five hours to give them a
little bit of sleep cycle and let my
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment rest, every living thing likes
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to give my mother plants a
little bit of sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you keep your mother plant on a
vegetative cycle, a vegetative light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it alive indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to feed it some sort of like
just a basic veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're feeding your veg plants,
you can feed your mother plants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basic nitrogen, keep the roots happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep them for a long time,
you're going to have to reap pot your
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, my mother plants only last
me about eight months to a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut new mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut six or eight clones for my mother
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will run four or five of those,
but I'll keep one of them behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go into a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go into pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just put it into that mother
room and replace the old mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because they start to get ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to get kind of lazy and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a bunch of cuts from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take clones from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been sprayed for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been manipulated under these lights
for eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to get kind of lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it's a good idea to take a
fresh cut from my mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it under that 19 five light
indefinitely, and then just keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you prune it, if you keep it
free of bugs, if you keep it healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that mother plant will stick around and
give you lots and lots of clones and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that strain alive forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that wraps up phenohunting,
selecting a keeper and using that keeper
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mother all within, we got that down
here in 25 minutes and 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I really appreciate you listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded this in two sessions on a new
app called Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on possibly doing a podcast
through Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will record as normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also record on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're participating on Periscope,
you will be able to ask me questions live
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show and I will answer them for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll only be able to type in the text
box, but I'll be able to read them,
[SPEAKER_00]: answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to help out the listeners
live on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a little bit more interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try it out once and see how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to announce when it's going to
happen so that people can participate and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can get people on and then we'll
try to do regularly scheduled shows like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every four or five episodes will be a
question episode, a live Q&A is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, I really appreciate you listening
to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody on Periscope watching now,
thanks for participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I've been ignoring the chat on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more focused on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I will participate with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periscope is a new app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I log in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn on the camera and you talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns you into basically your own
reality show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can watch for more if you are on
your phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watch other people's Periscopes also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Maya Bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you so much.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 77 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your podcast, your source for
cannabis news, education, and
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, today, sorry, that was a hard word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined by our good friend,
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good if I can get through this
intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest word was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said that word a lot, so there must
be something going on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain's... I think there's some dab on
your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my brain might be all sticky from
the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is a stony Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are recording on June 14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out on Thursday,
June 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into a lot of stuff,
I want to read an iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get a lot of iTunes comments on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got to say thanks to Kat and Coot
from the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opening song is the Doggy Dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is from the Mystic Roots Band off the
album, The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support the Mystic Roots
Band and stay positive sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a new iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love it when we get iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment is from Adrian WSK,
and it says, this podcast rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to Mondays because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gives us five stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from Adrian.

[SPEAKER_03]: And in that same theme, thanks,
FastBerry for the tweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for following directions,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did FastBerry tweet you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He follows myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He follows Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely, and Sean also,
he's definitely on top of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting us, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all of the super important
business we got to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no advertisements or anything on
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the shout out taken care of for the
comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a couple of minutes, actually,
I'm going to tell you what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is going to give us his little,
not little, I don't say little because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to downplay it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is going to give us his great
presentation about getting you into being
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis activist or a lobbyist,
or just getting your foot into the door to
[SPEAKER_00]: help us support cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike put together a little spiel on the
quick path to stepping up and helping
[SPEAKER_03]: fight for legalization in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get to that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: This story out of San Ana, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm saying that right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who was from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's San Ana, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike tweeted this the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys follow Mike or the show on
Twitter or my personal Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly my most popular tweet ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of Twitter notifications
because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike is at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at Rasta Jeff420 and the show is at
GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our Twitter started blowing up when
this video came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of the video is San Ana Pot Shop
Raid Sparks Investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to play the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I can play this video and
no one's going to get mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to play it here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to watch it and I'm going to
kind of narrate it and what's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a little like a Doug Benson interruption
sort of a thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to interrupt this thing
and talk a bunch of shit over it and
[SPEAKER_00]: explain what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off with, I'll just,
before we even hit play, it starts off
[SPEAKER_00]: with a disclaimer and I want to read that
to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the following video shows a raid
by San Ana Police at the Sky High Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Dispensary on May 27th,
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: The footage has been edited by the
dispensary's attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The text that appears in the portions of
the video also were inserted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys to explain what they believe was
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: After reviewing the photo, San Ana's
police chief says he plans to investigate
[SPEAKER_00]: the officer's actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit play and I may have to
adjust the volume a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I still got the reggae playing from
the intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to adjust the volume
because it's a YouTube video and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: choppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, before you hit play,
man, just a little background for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city in question here decided that
they were going to ban all dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were several that had opened up
already or opened up in the face of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ban and continued to operate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not exactly sure what steps were
taken before the video starts playing by
[SPEAKER_03]: the city, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The video's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to defend anything in it,
just to give you guys a little heads up as
[SPEAKER_03]: to what led up to the video hitting or
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit play now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if the volume is wonky,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be on it quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is... That's the
battering ram on the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit pause and talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're battering ramming the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're busting in the front door,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hitting it with the battering ram
inward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an outward pulling door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dude would have grabbed the handle
and pulled, it would have opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unlocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a business that's open for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The view that we're seeing is coming from
a hidden camera and security cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law enforcement tore down all the
cameras during the raid, but there were
[SPEAKER_00]: hidden cameras in here at the advice of
the attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you own a dispensary, put up some
hidden cameras so that you can catch this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit if it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all they had to do was pull that door
open and walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They slammed the door with the battering
ram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, then they finally realized,
oh, we can pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pull the door open and they come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're now rushing in and clearing
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are carrying pistols.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are carrying assault rifles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all in body armor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are wearing masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bust open the door of what would be
the bud room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the noise is just so noisy in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they start yelling, get on the fucking
ground to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these people are just customers
just shopping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look a little confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wait, we're shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit play again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the volume, the sound is terrible on
this video, but it's just a security cam
[SPEAKER_00]: footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hear them yelling, get on the
fucking ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're throwing everybody on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cops got guns on everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops got masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one cop's got his helmet on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one dude's not wearing a mask or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they're getting everybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're telling the employees to turn off
the music, turn off that radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the music is pretty loud in the
shop.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it that all the giant guy cops are
in masks and there's like 160 pound female
[SPEAKER_03]: officer and she's not in a mask.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the mask for, fellas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The masks will come off soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they come off when all the cops
think the cameras are destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Mike can't see the screen right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't know what's going on,
but he's seen the video enough times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are escorting a lady out who is
in a wheelchair, who I found out later
[SPEAKER_00]: after the video was posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is blind and in a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just making them follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she has one leg and she's just at
the shop as a patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what they had to say about the lady
with the amputated leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure you guys can hear
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what the cops are saying about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got some sound equipment trying
to process it to make it sound better
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is maybe a 50 or 60 year old
woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one cop asked, did you punch that
old Bonita and the lady cop replied,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to kick her in her fucking
knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people that we pay to
protect and serve us.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people that think they're
doing us a service.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the land of the free, in the home of
the brave, these are the people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: serving and protecting the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about, did you punch
that old Bonita?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a 60 year old woman in a
wheelchair with one leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: A handicapped lady.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What law enforcement action would require
you to ever physically assault a 60 year
[SPEAKER_03]: old woman in a wheelchair?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why would she want to kick her in her
fucking knob?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not any sort of law enforcement
tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure if we look up any law
enforcement manual, kick her in her
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking knob is not in there ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit play again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find more bullshit in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it just gets worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps repeating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, they just keep playing it from
different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the next part is the officers
climbing up on to the display cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, first he's trying to pull it down
with like his crowbar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're swinging at the cameras on the
ceiling with a crowbar and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: just smashing security equipment because
they don't want what's about to take place
[SPEAKER_03]: to be recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't realize that they were on
a hidden camera, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy looked right into it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't realize it was a hidden
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had two layers of cameras, so cops
completely missed layer number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice looking shop too, wherever
this place was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had several jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a well set up place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a nice looking menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's painted well, nice hardwood floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a good shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lobby doesn't look totally different
from the one I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the spot dispensary while
this video plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cops are now tearing down the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seven minute video guys,
and we're probably going to watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of it here while we talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cops are in the offices climbing
up on top of the desks and the saves and
[SPEAKER_00]: now they've got bolt cutters and then cut
the wires on all the shit and they pull
[SPEAKER_00]: the TV down and just start cutting wires
and they're watching the monitor to see
[SPEAKER_00]: where the cameras are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're sending the dudes to go cut
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's in like full on, he looks like
fucking GI Joe, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in full on SWAT gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got more guns than you need for a
fucking army.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dudes went into a dispensary where
people were shopping and doing business
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and rated them like fucking SWAT
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't there a crack house or somewhere
that needed to be rated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point in the video, all the
furniture has been smashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Desks are flipped over.
[SPEAKER_03]: The display cases are all broken open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're carrying out the DVRs as evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now here's where the video gets funny
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they think they've broken all the
cameras and disconnected the DVR so they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think anybody can see them now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now all the masks come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is masked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are opening each jar and smelling the
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the officers has the buds pressed
up against his face, just like you or I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do it and smelling it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I got to turn it down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of the officers, that's one
officer asking another for one edible,
[SPEAKER_03]: please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the guys, all right,
I'm going to pause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, officer that I don't know his
name, he's wearing a white shirt with
[SPEAKER_00]: green sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a shaved head, a beard and a
mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just unwrapped a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot tell you that it was certainly an
edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infused with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his friend just said one edible,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he unwrapped this food product and put
it directly into his mouth and offered the
[SPEAKER_00]: second half to his other buddy who is
wearing fucking cop uniform, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green pants, greenish gray pants,
black police shirt and a bald fucking head
[SPEAKER_00]: and some sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of muscular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Handed the other part to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if he eats that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video cut away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the lawyers edited it kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just showed this fucking cop
that's raiding the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: eating the edibles from the dispensary
that he's raiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that uphold the law?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that justice?
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, all of these officers are on
duty and they're consuming edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all contributing to each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all high fiving and having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them starts playing darts at one
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're just hanging out,
throwing darts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that ate the edible doesn't show
any signs of being high right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, but I don't know how much time has
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just sitting around playing
darts, texting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who they're texting,
but they're all texting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their phones out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just dicking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all on the clock laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've mostly proven my point,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cops raided a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were complete disrespectful cunts to
handicap people, a lady in a wheelchair,
[SPEAKER_00]: a blind lady, medical marijuana patients,
regular customers, employees of this
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They belittled all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They disrespected these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They violated their civil rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they come in and destroy this place's
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably cost them so much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The store looks like shit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful when they started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to add insult to fucking injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are the people that we pay to
protect us, to keep us safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in and they basically robbed
this place because now they're eating the
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they were supposed to
destroy on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're munching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like laughing in our faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, this other cop is full on just
unwrapped an edible and is grubbing it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sitting at the counter, grubbing it,
reading the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, carrying it around with them and
just munching on it like it's fucking a
[SPEAKER_00]: banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they just went balls in like that and
ate these edibles and didn't get stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: high, they're pot consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're regular consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regular, regular consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much disturbing behavior packed
into such a short video.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just munching it and he gave a thumbs
up to somebody like, this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're bagging shit up to take home,
it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that that's about what's
about to happen, but I can't promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my presumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put something in a bag and he's walking
off a camera with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't look like an evidence bag to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was a bag from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a checkout bag that I fill
all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to keep you updated on what
happens with the Santa Ana police after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely going to be some sort
of results.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an investigation going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor has made public comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's blowing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the video people and share it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure everybody sees it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often do you hear, hey, it's
practically legal in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get your medical card, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in that shop had a medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they just sent the customers
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, Mike and I, I was the
manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the keys, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run the only dispensary in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much my shop for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Mike was my backup bud tender because
I couldn't handle it all by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working 12 hour days, six days a
week and killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Mike in there to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one day they decided to come in and
close us while we had customers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to prove a point, Mike, do you want
to tell us how they chose to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: close our medical marijuana dispensary?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was just a regular random
police officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the city manager at the time walked
up to the front door, knocked on the door,
[SPEAKER_03]: security let them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They asked to speak to a manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: The manager walked up and asked,
hi, what can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, hi, we're from the city of
Pueblo and we've got to deliver this
[SPEAKER_03]: letter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they turned around and left.
[SPEAKER_03]: The letter said, we haven't passed
regulations for dispensaries yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to close.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted to kick any old Benita?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing was smashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have to break out the SWAT
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody needed to protect their identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: While they destroyed property in a random
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need to feel intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need to waste 12 officers
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need to fuck up our days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in and said, you guys are fired
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walked in and said, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find a new job soon is what
they all walked in and said.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't raid or smash or steal
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's absolutely no need for this on
behalf of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got dispensaries 10 miles away
every direction, but not in our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good move there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Ana, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how this turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let these cops get away with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys, if you sent them there to take
down this dispensary because cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal, by eating the evidence
there, they definitely committed a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had done that, if you caught me
destroying evidence on camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part of the video that really pissed
me off and I knew I had to share it
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere I possibly could was right at
the end of the video, the fire department
[SPEAKER_03]: shows up and one of the cops shouts nice
and loud and clear for the microphones,
[SPEAKER_03]: fire's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody watch your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the police department and the fire
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're essentially like Batman and
fucking Robin, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would the fire department seeing and
hearing the police doing police work or
[SPEAKER_03]: business be a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they have to watch their mouth
around the fire department?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because you're stealing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because you're eating edibles on the
job?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't drink on the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure you can't consume cannabis
on the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cop raiding a place,
you shouldn't be consuming anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: there because then you're a Hippocratic
prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's theft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but then you're also a prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was like, Mike, you're an asshole
because you smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to turn you into the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, dude, you just took four
dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Hippocratic prick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a definite Hippocrat for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cops that are going in and
ruining people's lives and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, well, I'm going to take some of
the product that I just ruined your life
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a fucking piece of shit person
move.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it doesn't matter what they're
raiding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't take or eat anything there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no one's been convicted of a
crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just destroying stuff for fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stealing for fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sitting there eating infused
cannabis fucking candy on the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when a call comes in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the bank up the street is getting
robbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've got a cop on a fucking decadose
chibichu stumbling through the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: streets in full body armor with a
semi-automatic assault rifle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the last thing anyone needs is
a bunch of cops on edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got almost 20 minutes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike put together some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asking him to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get more people involved in
cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_03]: This video is a nice little spark.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not getting involved and you've
kept your head down to this point,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is in California where weeds
basically legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're arresting people, threatening to
kick an old woman in a wheelchair because
[SPEAKER_03]: she didn't hustle the fuck up fast enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just absolutely ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody needs to say enough is enough
and stand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're about to tell you how to do
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my good buddy, Mike, and he's
going to help you guys learn how to stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need another drink, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you shaking your half 50 bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a water or one of these cans?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's time to stand up and get involved,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first first thing I would say is
figure out what about cannabis you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really passionate about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you love how it relaxes you at the end
of the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you love getting nice and high and
playing video games?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like the social aspect of sitting
in a circle with your friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: passing a joint and talking about
whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you enjoy different medical aspects of
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it ease your pain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it stop your seizures?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it allow you to eat through the
nausea of whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it helping fight your cancer?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's got you really passionate about
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What sparks that fire?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're going to need some fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some of this gets really dull.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you have a sick family member
that you need to fight for because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask me all day long about I have a
sick friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: What product should I point them towards?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have people asking me about their pain
all day or their ailments and what
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis might do for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of people out there
that know it's about a lot more than just
[SPEAKER_03]: getting high.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even if it's just about getting high
for you, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humans have enjoyed intoxicants since
before we had like a society.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even little kids spin around in
circles to break free of reality for a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just something humans like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is great for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the safest intoxicant known to man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every other intoxicant causes a lot of
harm to your body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The feds have been looking for a long
time, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start doing your research,
you're going to learn that as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: intoxicants go, I mean, even just beer and
alcohol, cannabis is far, far safer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you just prefer it over alcohol,
that's still a great reason to stand up
[SPEAKER_03]: and say, hey, we need to legalize this in
my area.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be super sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab because Mike's got
a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't get a dab so hard on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you've got that spark lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what really turns you on about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to start getting educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to start learning a couple of
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, start researching cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a long and interesting history.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point in time, the medical
research and the research on safety for
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption and even if you're smoking big
old fat joints all the time, vaporizers
[SPEAKER_03]: are a lot healthier way to consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to skip that burning plant
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even if you're puffing Jays old
school, you're not doing the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: damage to your body that a tobacco smoker
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a one-to-one comparison,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get online and start learning everything
you can about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to sit down and do it all
at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if you love cannabis,
learning a lot about it and knowing that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not killing yourself because you
enjoy it, that's something that everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: should want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you're learning about cannabis,
start learning about the laws in your
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the United States,
the internet, every local government,
[SPEAKER_03]: regardless of how small a town or area you
live in, everything's online at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out when the meetings are happening,
how that government's structured,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's a city council or if it's a board
of county commissioners or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure out when they meet and just start
going to meetings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit in the back and just observe how they
play out.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I laugh a lot
about, the anti-pot groups down here never
[SPEAKER_03]: did this step.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just started showing up to meetings
and shouting shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you don't know how the meetings
function, you don't know where to put your
[SPEAKER_03]: effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like, I don't know,
an idiot showing up the first day on the
[SPEAKER_03]: job and just tackling random things in the
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not helpful no matter how much
energy or passion you're throwing into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you take a couple of really long
boring nights these meetings can go for
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three hours at a stand and just see
how they flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them allow democratic
participation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any member of the public can show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they follow a couple of really
simple, easy rules, like sign up and then
[SPEAKER_03]: speak during the appropriate time of the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really simple shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get up and say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're not cussing at somebody
or screaming and yelling at somebody on
[SPEAKER_03]: council, they'll let you rant about
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you five full minutes,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe six.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get five minutes at the beginning of
every meeting down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just sign up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They allow six people to sign up every
meeting and you can rant about whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the most part, it's these three
old guys that just show up and bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say sometimes nobody signs
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone on council down here has thanked
me for breaking up the tedium of the
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of people that speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't all agree with me, but they
appreciate me going and saying something
[SPEAKER_03]: coherent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're down to hear whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that have come and spoke
out about roadside memorials.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whatever issue interests you,
you can go down and speak about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your issue is cannabis, you can show
up to your local town council.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've done your homework a little
bit, you can point out how many millions
[SPEAKER_03]: of dollars they could make if cannabis was
legal in their area.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take the time to pull the data
coming out of Colorado and Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: state, it's been 18 months since
recreational stores were open their doors
[SPEAKER_03]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got all the data we need to prove
just how safe cannabis legalization is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have stores that adults 21 years
of age or older can walk into.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you throw the shit and well-labeled
child proof packaging, it's perfectly
[SPEAKER_03]: safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no harm caused.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no increase in any DUIs or teen
access.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's so much cannabis out there
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the stores do is change who profits
from the sale and where a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: adults choose to go to buy their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalization isn't a huge earth shattering
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the end of a lot of stupidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Colorado, we've been keeping tally
of the numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been watching very closely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was supposed to be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the predictions a year or two ago
are laughable now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The local paper, the chieftain does a shit
job regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And miracle in miracles, they did an
amazing expose on what legal marijuana did
[SPEAKER_03]: to our county.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sold $17 million worth of marijuana and
the cops can't point to a firm problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: $17 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only 150,000 people down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do the math.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like the black market died.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a huge number of people prefer
going to the stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buying weed on the black market can be a
nightmare, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're so spoiled in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard to think back to what it
used to be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people have a hardcore dealer
that they've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They operate under dealer rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you meet in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a quick exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bag's light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got other crap in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never the strain they say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops looking to arrest you for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some friends in from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like friends of a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My good friend had family in from
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we went to the
dispensary over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, you went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, they wanted to go
to that place because they heard a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and wanted to see what it was
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they just wanted the experience
of going through the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going off track now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn the laws in your area, how the
public meetings work, and when and how
[SPEAKER_03]: public comment is taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then look up other legalization groups
in your area, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a ton of groups out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the 1970s, we were really close to
marijuana being legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was legal, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that fell apart, a number of
groups started forming nationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: NORML's the big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I just wrote down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was NORML.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not familiar with NORML,
you really, really need to start Googling
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also the Marijuana Policy Project.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing national lobbying for
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've helped write a number of the laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they helped with Colorado's.
[SPEAKER_03]: They helped with Alaska's.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've written a number of other medical
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a really big organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check them out, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Students for a sensible drug policy is on
pretty much every college campus in
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is ex-cops, ex-DEA agents,
judges, lawyers that through experience
[SPEAKER_03]: have learned just how pointless marijuana
prohibition is and have begun calling for
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a great group, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow them on social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of their YouTube videos are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning, okay, so I'm going to start
going out and speaking for legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck does that look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I just go to city council and go free
weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull up LEAP's videos on YouTube,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy, Peter Christ is his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull them up on YouTube and just watch him
destroy the idea of prohibition in 15
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great place to start, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last organization I'd say everybody
needs to check out is a group called Flex
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go and start speaking
up about marijuana legalization in an area
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's not already medically legal or
there's not a number of other people doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that, it can be terrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that's really going to
help you feel a lot more secure in doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that is knowing what your rights are as a
citizen in the good old United States of
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flex Your Rights is an organization of
defense attorneys that have put together a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of great videos and little training
web pages on flexing your rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: What rights do you have when a cop pounds
on your door and says, open up,
[SPEAKER_03]: police?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should all watch that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should watch that, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone that's listening right now should
pull up these videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your rights when you get pulled
over during a traffic stop?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you get on YouTube and watch
some of the same shit I do, you've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: people refuse to roll their window down
and just hand or put up IDs to the window
[SPEAKER_03]: and completely refuse what the cop's
saying and just do something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cops all look befuddled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the important cop walks over,
tells the other cops they don't get to
[SPEAKER_03]: smash the window and they don't get to
ruin this guy's night and the guy's free
[SPEAKER_03]: to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn how to do that legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stand up in front of the police chief
because the police chiefs at a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: these meetings, the city councils at these
meetings, the city attorney, everyone's in
[SPEAKER_03]: a suit and tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are cameras rolling and you're going
to stand up and encourage them to legalize
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana or to push for legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be really scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you know your rights and you've
paid attention in the meetings and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know how they flow and you make your
argument at the appropriate time,
[SPEAKER_03]: the appropriate way, they're going to hear
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be impressed and they're
going to want to know more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you've done your homework and
you're educated, when they come up to you
[SPEAKER_03]: after the meeting and go, I like what you
said, can we sit down later?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about what pot legalization
might do for our little town here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to lunch later and really
explain, okay, in Colorado, towns this
[SPEAKER_03]: size that allowed this many shops,
made this much in tax revenue,
[SPEAKER_03]: this much in application fees,
they spent this much in enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're able to spend an extra this
much on their roads this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you make that argument to someone in
local government, they're going to just be
[SPEAKER_03]: astounded at the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have to look at this
issue in a new way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Pueblo is a poor town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like half the people down here are on some
form of assistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually like 60%.
[SPEAKER_03]: The median income down here is like 14
grand a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Jeff just looked at me a little
horrified.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little shocked too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's a big city.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full of a lot of people in hard
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this industry has been huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: The jobs, the local investment in the
city, hop on the Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the Chieftain.com and scroll
all the way down to the bottom of the page
[SPEAKER_03]: on the right-hand side, they've got a
couple of big exposés they've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them is called the growing
trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I suppose you could just Google the
Chieftain, the growing trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It brings up a big series of reports and
they break down what the police had to say
[SPEAKER_03]: after the county sold 17 million in pot
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the teachers had to say and the
principals, what the fire department had
[SPEAKER_03]: to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tallied up what the county spent on
enforcement and going out and making sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that you met zoning and that you were
checking IDs and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They added up everything they could think
of that was related to legal pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they tallied it in one column and it
was like 220 grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pulled in 1.7 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a million and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge return on a small investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all they had to do is get out of
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that we're bringing more
people here because I know we're bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: people here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado's seeing a flood of people
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like the gold rushes before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just moving, but visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming to like just to come buy a
bag of weed and go on a hike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people coming to visit and
checking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm hoping they all take home is
when they get home, they need to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone they know how insane and rational
this decision was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people are shocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, you're going to add another
legal intoxicant to the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be terrible for society.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, marijuana has never killed anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol kills almost 100,000 people a
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's before the car crashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobacco kills almost half a million people
every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's from getting diseases from
using and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police kill more people than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 already this year, just because I know
that's that off the top of my head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanuts kill more people than cannabis
every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lightning kills 52 Americans a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to look that shit up recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting off track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going, dude, because you've got quite
a bit of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure you get this in.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've started attending meetings and
figuring out how they work.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to start speaking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the terrifying part.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to sit at home and Google.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does cannabis cure cancer?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then read what Dr. Tashkin has to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or to Google the history of cannabis and
spend the night reading about how the
[SPEAKER_03]: federal government's run a medical
marijuana program every year I've fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: been alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started in 1982, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They mail people 11 ounces of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: How the fuck did you not know about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Google it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to follow you home from
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But going down to city council and
standing up at the podium and swearing in,
[SPEAKER_03]: giving your name and address, and then
speaking out for legalization can be
[SPEAKER_03]: scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do it right, you're going to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to follow you home.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even like an extra layer of
protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if the cops are going to screw
with the person that's going to city
[SPEAKER_03]: council and making a stink, it's going to
be press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do the cops want press?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to bring the district
attorney in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops do not need any press right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they don't want any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they pretty much leave you alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had an issue and I've been
doing this for like six years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you got to do is figure out what
you want to say and how you want to say
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about medical access?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about full blown
legalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a few minutes and really pen out what
you want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a couple of bullet point notes of the
points you want to hit and then practice
[SPEAKER_03]: it a couple of times at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself familiar with it because it
can be really nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate public speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm nervous sitting here on the podcast
and I love it in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get shaky the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear a lot of people get shaky and
city council knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at you like it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're struggling, they'll even
like, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get in trouble here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they try to reassure you a little
bit, even if they disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they see that you're nervous,
they're really nice about it usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But plan out what you want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice it a couple of times at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go down to the meeting or just
throw on clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, you don't have to dress way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go in jeans and a button down shirt to
every meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off your hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got dreads, tie them back neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a big beard, maybe clean it
up a little bit, but just clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to go buy a suit or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, there are some guys that come in
there looking like they just, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing their work uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Hey, I'm part of this
union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, I could tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, and we feel this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that shows that they're a
working fucking man and that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking about what they've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're coming straight from work,
it's perfectly appropriate to show up and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you were wearing at work that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause most of these meetings are like six
o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much when everybody's
headed home, we've got a normal job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just throw on something clean if you
can get yourself cleaned up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: practice what you're going to say,
then go down, sign up and say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, throw on a clean shirt,
go down and go down, sign up and speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to start off with good evening
council.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think going like gentlemen and lady
makes you sound like a dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's, you know, men and women on
the council, you can just skip all of that
[SPEAKER_03]: nonsense with good evening council or good
evening board of county commissioners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just use their formal title and then say
what you've got to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end, try to say thank you
for, thank you for, you know, giving me
[SPEAKER_03]: this chance to speak tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really appreciate it when people
thank them and then hang out at the
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the part that everyone,
regardless of their issue skips.
[SPEAKER_03]: The night you go speak at the meeting,
nine times out of 10, when the section of
[SPEAKER_03]: time where the public can speak is over,
everyone in the meeting shuffles out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council down here even pauses for
a minute to allow it to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the very next step of the meeting is
council commentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, where they sit in banter back and
forth for a few minutes about what they
[SPEAKER_03]: just heard and about other shit that's
come up that week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the important part of the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're arguing with them about
anything, knowing the issues city council
[SPEAKER_03]: cares about, knowing the different
projects they're working on in the city,
[SPEAKER_03]: knowing out of the hundreds of emails they
get each week, which one or two they
[SPEAKER_03]: choose to bring up at city council as
though it's a folksy fucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like knowing that stuff helps you
structure your argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially after you've spoken,
because they frequently discuss what they
[SPEAKER_03]: heard that night before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't tell you how many times I've
heard, I wish the person who spoke earlier
[SPEAKER_03]: was still in this room because we'd like
to thank him for coming and speaking out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when we know it's tough to do
and da da da da.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one was this, this really sweet
kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was super nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kept stopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard him talking before the meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have a stammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He fully had a stammer while he was
testifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was talking about the homeless
problem down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he left immediately after he spoke and
the council spent maybe 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_03]: debating the issue and gathering city
research or asking the city manager about
[SPEAKER_03]: resources to help the kid with his issue
or to address some of the issues the kid
[SPEAKER_03]: brought up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would have been great if he was
there for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was already gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I doubt he'll pull it up online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there when they've called upon
you to answer a cannabis question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Michael, are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one guy's like, that guy over there
knows, let him speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just stand up and you're like,
the answer is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people look at you like you're a
fucking robot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So become, you guys can all become that
guy for council and don't expect it to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching Mike do this for
probably eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot of time, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you first go at best, you're the
articulate guy talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fifth time you go and speak,
you're the really articulate guy who comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to meetings and knows what he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's presenting an argument in a way
that a lot of people are really starting
[SPEAKER_03]: to listen to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after the first year or so,
you're the person they think of when that
[SPEAKER_03]: issue comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should get a hold of that guy and ask
him what his take on this issue is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I get two or three calls a week from
reporters down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes fact-checking a story they're
doing, sometimes asking for my take on an
[SPEAKER_03]: issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm forever running to the newsstand to
grab a paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that comes up after
you start doing it for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know someone who can blank and we
both look at each other and chuckle?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the answer to this odd cannabis
question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the car with Mike and city
council members have called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, turn on the music, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the reggae full blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, this is a council member.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to turn that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The meetings are real formal and it's so
procedural and there's police officers in
[SPEAKER_03]: the heads of the city or the town or
whatever there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems really rigid and kind of
terrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you've gone a few times,
you see that it's just bored politicians
[SPEAKER_03]: who desperately want someone else to give
a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're super happy to have anyone
come down to the meetings and be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only people that are there are paid to
be there or people that are asking for
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start showing up is the guy
saying, I've done my homework.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured out the marijuana legalization
could save our county a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars and make our county $200,000 on
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you show up and say, I found a way
for you to make a huge amount of money or
[SPEAKER_03]: a way to bring a whole bunch of jobs to
our area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you tell your argument,
well, you can really hit these people in
[SPEAKER_03]: ways that they're going to go home
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is giving you guys like 12 good
points to make the tax money that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in the jobs that it's going to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has already gotten you guys a bunch
of head starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 10 years ago when I was studying
this stuff in college, it was all
[SPEAKER_03]: theoretical.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could guess what legalization might do
to an area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could look at Amsterdam and kind of
guesstimate what that would look like in
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been 15 years since our medical
marijuana laws passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2008 was the dispensary explosion with the
medical marijuana heyday that we always
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the data that's been collected all
that time, the cops were sure this was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to lead to the apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rehab industry was sure this was going
to lead to the apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_03]: The government was sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everybody was keeping records.
[SPEAKER_03]: The department of revenue in Colorado,
you can go on their website and pull the
[SPEAKER_03]: tax numbers by county, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see what the 1% kickback that the
generating area gets from the state adds
[SPEAKER_03]: up to for every little town that allows
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can pull those numbers wherever
you are on the planet now and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: our little town has 40,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done the math and we can make this
much or save this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make this much, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cost you a little, but I mean,
over a year's time, you're going to...
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made $17 million here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not experimenting anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just looking at the reality and
choosing the course that makes the most
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone just over 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be done in 14 minutes at the
most.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty much done, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have questions about getting
involved or need help finding something
[SPEAKER_03]: research-wise, feel free to tweet me or
feel free to shoot the podcast in email
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'll get those answered on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'd love to... We love the
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we skipped something, if there's
something else that you need more details
[SPEAKER_00]: on, get it Mike, get it myself,
get it the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll answer it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically... Go ahead, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got something else to go for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just start Googling.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't find the answer with two or
three Google questions, send me a tweet,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll teach you how to Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All human information is on the internet
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to ask Google correctly and
it will bring it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike gave out a bunch of groups that we
should support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those groups, I'll repeat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's NORML, the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MPP, the medical... Reminding you of
the marijuana... Marijuana Policy Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Policy Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEAP, that's Law Enforcement Against
Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Christ will show you how to keep
yourself out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flexyourrights.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flexyourrights.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just Google flexyourrights,
it'll come right up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out that because then you can learn
how to protect yourself in an interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an upcoming episode, we're going to
watch a video of some cops smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're retired police officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen the video yet, but we're
definitely going to watch that here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have coming up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Clint is going to be on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it when Clint's on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and a few other friends actually went
to see Doug Benson on 420 and Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded a comedy album on 420 and the
album is now out and Clint and I both
[SPEAKER_00]: downloaded it and we have listened to it
and we're going to review the album here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to get Clint's stupid
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think is going to happen on
that episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be here for his first dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Clint will ever take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, we're going to start
wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too far, I want to give a big
shout out to my homie Deez.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I played a really dancey
electronic song at the end of the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was from my buddy Deez.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to play that one again here at
the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a note to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also huge, huge shout outs to Sonny,
Reve and Arnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Sonny threw a party Saturday
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He invited me to come play some drums with
kind of a band that we had never met
[SPEAKER_00]: before and we put a band together that
night and we played a bunch of songs for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours and we killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Sonny for the invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Reve and Arnie for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to doing that again in the
very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to The Spot Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, big old shout out for coming on the
show and teaching people how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we've needed for a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking forward to doing this
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I didn't go too fast for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to tweet me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at demotepunk15.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can direct message about whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can help you get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent like 10 years passionately
researching cannabis, the history,
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical effects, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to point you in whatever
direction you're looking to get informed
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, just hit me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows a lot of shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a real narrow scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows kind of a broad scope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's any at all weed or social policy
related, I have researched living shit out
[SPEAKER_03]: of it and I'm happy to help.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for helping us, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for listening to another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with, I think it's
going to be episode 78, Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait for 100, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no big promises for 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to focus about two
episodes ahead right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keeps them tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you guys have ideas for episode
100, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, now that the show is over,

the show, leave a comment, give me a

move up into the ranks in iTunes.

[SPEAKER_00]: More people will grow good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes in a cycle.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to listen to the rest because
you're a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, all you guys that are growers and
stuff, it's Clint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a crazy episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, it's time for 78 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to skip the intro because
Clint already crashed the whole party and
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said we might have one mishap at the
start and I was like, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: good mishap then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe how many false starts
I've had on this podcast when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: recording by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I have a really hard time
busting out the intro when I'm alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there are people here,
it flows out like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like this time you did a real good
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't skip a single word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you got everything you wanted to say
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have just turned your microphone
down and just kept you down until I
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kept yelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it just got even louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining me today is my friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a local comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what he claims to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already seen his skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint is an amateur pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He usually takes two puffs of sour diesel
and today he took three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still undecided because I can't
remember if I took two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he took three because you were
fucking higher than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You going to be good?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're here right now with all these
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean all the people that are
listening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think there are more people
here, do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just the ones behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, you can already tell
what kind of episode this is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to send a huge thank you shout
out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let me play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any advertising to do at the
start of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already fucked it up anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't fuck anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You break up the monotony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it explosively fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: You good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul texted me and I accidentally looked
at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed everything you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a jerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's got what we've been referring to
as goldfish brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About every 30 seconds, Clint resets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, he's back at the beginning again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, the first thing that Clint and I
want to do is review the Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_00]: album.
[SPEAKER_00]: On 420, Doug Benson came to Denver,
Colorado, and he did three shows and
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded all three of them for his new
comedy album, which was called Promotional
[SPEAKER_00]: Tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out just a couple of few days
ago here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it came out on the fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the ninth, but you're high,
so it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was five, nine, not nine, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you'll be all right eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hope this is funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is just me just being a fucking
dick and your fans have to listen to it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully they will too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get a certain percentage or do you
know anybody in Pueblo listening?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our Pueblo friends listen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I found out that Drew listens
and that... On Dustin's listen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe and his friend that I just met,
I want to call him Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe and Kevin listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know that those guys listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Joe and Kevin that I
recently saw on Baca's couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baca listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we get a lot of local listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arnie listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark has been listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's finally paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's make this like a real big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what if this podcast became like a
real big deal just in Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just like when a comedian would
come down or when a band had come through,
[SPEAKER_04]: it'd be cool for them to like,
man, it'd be cool to go get a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: too high with Rasta Jeff, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the morning radio show before
the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, but like more so like it's a get
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd almost be like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great to have that radio show
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying is that since the
Wild Cousins are presenting a comedy show
[SPEAKER_00]: with a man by the name of Sam Talent- The
funniest man I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On July 23rd, 2015 at the Rainbow Bar,
are you saying that maybe we should have
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam Talent come be on the podcast and be a
little bit funny and we could talk to him
[SPEAKER_00]: about his cannabis experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's got a funny weed story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're thinking we could do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will ask him.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got to come too, because I don't
know the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, Clint is going to try to
get a comedian by the name of Sam Talent
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's going to do a show at the
Rainbow Bar, July 23rd, 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a free show, but donations are
encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this show,
show up, pay $5 because that's what I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show will be worth $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go be a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look like a pimp if you throw down
five for the free show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fun show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got my buddy Paul Rosales and my
other buddy John Bueno on that show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is my little comedy crew called
the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wearing my Wild Cousins shirt
yesterday and people like to give me the
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdest looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shirt has a kitty cat shooting an
assault rifle.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a six foot five dude with dreadlocks
and people look at me with great
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a weird shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a whole bunch of them and we just
have never tried to sell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so fun that we just gave up on them
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thinking about getting Grow From Your
Heart podcast t-shirts made here
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rock one of those, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully by episode 100, I'll be able to
give a couple of them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should talk to Barrett.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Barrett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Barrett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Last Leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Last Leaf, I think, is Moe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moe's not doing shirts though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think unless Barrett bought up Moe's
shit and they just call it the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just got real local.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go back to talking about
funny weed shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went and saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On 420, we saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did three shows at the ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite comedy club on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, I always shout out to
Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker was watching my Periscope broadcast
last night and having a conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: me and I was slightly honored.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Baker's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came out and shook my hand the other
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognized him and I waved at him and he
recognized me, probably because I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking ridiculous looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the tall thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the tall thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I go, Hey, Baker, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was after the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we had actually moved pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting rambly again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super high, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Baker's fucking cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, this is great because I've never
seen Clint this high and he's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortably high and I can see him like
re-situate himself every few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to lead into something
that we're going to talk about in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit here too, if we have time,
because Clint keeps talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like you're- Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four episodes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to make a reference and then I
forgot the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like you are...
[SPEAKER_00]: Pete Holmesing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being Pete Holmesed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever watch any of Doug Benson's
podcast, Pete Holmes will love to just
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupt and drag on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Pete Holmesing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do a little... On 420,
Doug came and did those comedy shows at
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I and a couple other people had
the honor of going to the third show that
[SPEAKER_00]: night, which may have been a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about that on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we downloaded the CD on the day that it
came out and we listened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fun part that I noticed right
away is he used the opening from the show
[SPEAKER_00]: we attended.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because he talks about how he was
trying to get too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that was definite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like you could have done that
twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even later in the album, you can hear
him and he's not that high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, oh man, I wish I'd
went to those other shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of pieces that I'm
certain came from our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that there's someone like,
oh, he did not do that in our show because
[SPEAKER_00]: he sounds awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my favorite parts of the entire
album is that on track one, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times when I can hear Clint over
laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it's great, dude, because it's
genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're such a big dude and your laugh
is so low that it just shakes the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy club when you laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in the front row in that little
pit area and there's a lot of sound right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, you were coming through on the
mic so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just hear Clint like,
it's so fucking funny hearing your buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: laugh on a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shitty thing is the comedy album,
not that funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug's my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what sucks?
[SPEAKER_04]: I might've been the funniest thing on that
album.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't tell Doug Benson I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ball Weed might be the funniest
thing on that album.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, he would hate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're being honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just didn't think it was that good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went and saw that show and I had a
prejudice against it already though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was already a little mad at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first track is 25 minutes of Doug
reading tweets on his comedy album.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's what he does in his live
show, but- He's just riffing off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to do a comedy album,
if I were a comedian, I would put
[SPEAKER_00]: together, I would Joe Rogan that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put together the tightest one hour
that I could come- And it might take you
[SPEAKER_04]: two years to do it, but you're real happy
to do it like that.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first album is 25 minutes of him
reading tweets for the first track.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second track is called Watch This,
Not That, where he plays a game that he
[SPEAKER_00]: normally plays on his podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: For free.
[SPEAKER_00]: For free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt like I paid $5 to download a
podcast basically, because I listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: his podcast frequently and it didn't feel
any better than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That son of a bitch turned 50 on us and
all of a sudden he became a money hungry
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking capitalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, this is all a ruse.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't smoke.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, about this album.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The album, like I was saying, the first
track is reading tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second track is talking about
something that he normally does on his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he actually tells a joke and then he
tells a couple more jokes and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: promotes his other podcasts and then he
promotes another podcast and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: promotes his other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he talks about traveling and then
he actually does a really good joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a well put together album and
that sucks because Doug's one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called Doug my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we contact each other and to see
one of your friends put something out like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it's almost like, Oh man,
you could have, you could have done a
[SPEAKER_00]: little harder on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most comedy albums, the comedian will
start with a decent story and then tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you a couple of jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you've forgotten
about that first story, he'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: another part that reminds you of that,
that refers to that to make you laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug has already forgotten the first part
of his act by the time he's 20 minutes in,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can't do a callback.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got Clint too high today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint got himself too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This podcast sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of, if you could give Doug Benson's
album, the podcast doesn't suck,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, we're going to make it
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could give Doug Benson's album up
to five pot leaves, a scale of one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: pot leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many leaves are you going to give him?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to get one pot leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to get one pot leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'll give him two, maybe two and a
half or three, but it's definitely was not
[SPEAKER_00]: a four or five star performance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's your friend and I think you're being
generous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm being mean too, but there's
just so many, there's so much to do out
[SPEAKER_04]: there now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I could download anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's that, that album right there
is my only introduction to Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing I know of him other
than his podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am the perfect demographic to go,
dude, like I'm not a cult follower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't, I'm, I'm mad that I bought
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm mad that I went to that show a little
bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 25 bucks that you spent on
disappointing, being disappointed twice
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have done that with a hooker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying $25 on a hooker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gotta be the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to upgrade $25 hookers,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to move on from Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Doug, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to bash your album, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta, you gotta put it together more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come to your show on the 5th
of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you there at the Comedy Works in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that Clint wants to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got someone else I could take,
but I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasn't, I like the way that Proops
put together a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way Ari put together a comedy
album.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more continuity is the word I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flows a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd prefer that out of a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you watch that Bill Burr album?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did see that one, the black
and white one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember now, but that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I expect out of a comedy
album.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard to be like, all right,
well, here's this guy who's perfect at
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's Bill Burr to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's perfect at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He works so hard at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so exciting to watch somebody be
perfect at something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony Jeselnik is damn near perfect at
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, it's just, I think that Jeselnik has
his routine, but Bill Burr could just go
[SPEAKER_04]: off on anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so beautiful to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most of those bits that he has,
he's kind of half improvising as he's
[SPEAKER_04]: telling the joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows how long and what beats he wants
to hit, but it's not like that regimented,
[SPEAKER_04]: I say it like this, Jeselnik kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeselnik is kind of a robot in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you've said it plenty of times,
like he counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see his throat moving when he
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see him say the word 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I'm saying is like he-
Bill Burr can go in there and do his
[SPEAKER_00]: routine and then break away and do some
dance moves and then go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that about a comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proops has that ability as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's so fucking smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when we were talking to him,
when he smacked you that day, about that
[SPEAKER_04]: story, it was just so much fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just being in the room with him was
fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that storyteller personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get Greg Proops on,
this is not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Season three or two is coming out pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rambly, but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's coming back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel him connecting a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goldfish in his brain is not swimming
in such short circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laps have gotten larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sweetie birds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going around my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He upgraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squirrel that runs on the cage will be
back pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him a smoke break.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, you're getting almost funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty fucking dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost tried to talk over it,
but then I was like, we got to give him
[SPEAKER_00]: credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me a Facebook message and it
was a good question for Clint because they
[SPEAKER_00]: said, how much should I be smoking?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One.
[SPEAKER_00]: One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, Clint should have only taken one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using medical marijuana,
the beauty of it is that it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have chosen to medicate
yourself with medical marijuana because
[SPEAKER_00]: some doctor isn't saying take two of these
every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you to figure out how many
puffs off of this bowl or how much of this
[SPEAKER_00]: joint I need to smoke to ease my medical
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you've never smoked,
light up a joint and take two puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then see how that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's way too much, next time only
take one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that didn't do it, take three next
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a smaller joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll a smaller joint and don't get as
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to tell you how much you
should be smoking because I just watched
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint take three hits off of a bowl of
some pretty high grade sour diesel and he
[SPEAKER_00]: is high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff took two and then two fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to take another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs are my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint says dabs are drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see why he says that, but it's all
about what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking to medicate yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking to prevent seizures,
smoke as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's really just smoke until you're
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your smoking isn't hindering
your ability to be a productive person,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as it's not causing you a
financial problem, a health problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: a mental problem, a motivational problem,
a relationship problem, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not using it as a crutch, as long as it's
not an anchor or something negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as it's not causing a problem is
my point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke as much as you feel comfortable
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend every day trying to see
how high you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be Joey Diaz and try to
see the fucking devil every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why people want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just push the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing is because I'm
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of are pushing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third one was your limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pushing the limit, but not like going to
see the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get cross-eyed and don't take seven
dabs your first try.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's what I get.
[SPEAKER_04]: That fucking peer pressure is a
motherfucker though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not at our age, but I remember like
when we were like 16, 18, I would have
[SPEAKER_04]: done anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you wanted, for you to think I was
cool out of doing anything, I would have
[SPEAKER_04]: stabbed the motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if I was going to get laid at
the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could get laid at, I didn't get laid
until I was 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I was just a late bloomer,
but I'm just a skinny fucking white kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made up for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing okay now, but it's just,
it's weird to see that fucking goldfish
[SPEAKER_04]: reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: New thought process for Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to go for a bike ride buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets that ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did lose it buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: No edits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm leaving all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm leaving all your rambles in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your punishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to listen back to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be like, ah, that guy's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever was on the show that day was
fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Clint maybe only needed you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to see the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to see the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that every day, but do it once in
a while if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see what's on the other
side of that wall, take another dab or
[SPEAKER_00]: take another puff off the bowl and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a puff off of this
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking some Girl Scout cookies made
by the Turpax crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked it up at Green and Healthy
Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also shout out to John Randall Jr.
John Randall Jr. I'm going to take a dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we need to get Clint started on some
sort of rant before I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on your brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do an open mic every Thursday at the
Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I've told everybody about this
plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a comedy open mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Jeff's come down a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got friends that come down and it's real
fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't charge anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I mean, you can buy alcohol if
you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just come in and sit around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ask me to buy anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't expect anything of you if you
don't drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're there for the comedy,
you might've brought somebody that was
[SPEAKER_04]: able to drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all they, like we're trying to
bring business into the rainbow and get
[SPEAKER_04]: people in front of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the trade-off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the building for us to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make plenty of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulars are there at the bar
drinking, and then you guys are bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the other group that are buying drinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just asking people to start coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't commit to being there every night
because I'm a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want anybody there every week
either, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're not there to tell jokes
every week, don't come out every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I see all of your rehearsal material
and then get bored of you if I come every
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but if you came out once every three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I'm not, not you, not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once or twice a month is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once or twice a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even asking that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm just wanting once every three
months out of just one of my friends,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear the sadness in his voice,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it just sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like last night we went to go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, we were going to do it last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's Thursday, but we were going to do
one last night and no one showed up and it
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking broke my heart, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, we get all everything all set
up to go bartender sitting there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 10 o'clock comes around and
nobody's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in bands for several years and
I've played to the bartender for several
[SPEAKER_04]: shows and it's almost practice,
you know, so we didn't even fucking do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we're just like, nah, dude,
I don't, I don't want to fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to perform to Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just realized I'm just like,
uh, this fucking weird old guy that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: hanging out in bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even drinking, not even drinking,
but smoking weed in the back of fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come out to the open mic night you
guys, because if you don't, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might, uh, not let us keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's, that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, uh, we're the only public open mic
and, uh, it's, it's going to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't even get like other stuff
going on because we can't get anybody to
[SPEAKER_04]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So support local comedy guys, because if
you don't support things, they go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day you'll be like,
Hey, remember that comedy group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there won't even fucking exist because
you blew it off for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So support the local comedy, uh,
as to how much you should be smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done taking my dad now so I can rant
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, smoke until you're comfortably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have, there have been days and this
sound, you guys are going to think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been days when I've smoked a
gram or two by myself, like started a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I woke up, got done with it,
started another gram and finished that one
[SPEAKER_00]: by myself through that, throughout the
course of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think those are days when
I'm sitting around not doing shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those are actually the days when I'm
doing the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I do it, but I'll stop
and take four or five fat dads and go
[SPEAKER_00]: right back to work, work for an hour or
two, take four or five more dads,
[SPEAKER_04]: go right back to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you're busy and you got your mind
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the high doesn't stick around as
much, at least like you're using it
[SPEAKER_04]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know how at the end of the day,
your back hurts and you're all sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been doing work, I don't get
that because I've been dabbing all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my body doesn't even, my muscles stay
loose and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I guess it's like going to take
him to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, instead of taking a leave or
Tylenol or Prick of whatevers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just taking a few dabs and keeping the
pain away all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of, the dabs make my head,
I talk about, I prefer Indica flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabs make my head go really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the alpha brain, take two dabs and
drink a little bit of caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bro, I can work for 12 hours straight
without a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit picking at your skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you started saying I can work for
like 12 hours straight and then they
[SPEAKER_04]: started picking at your skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Jeff, what else are you doing in
them dabs, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ate a donut earlier and apparently
part of the frosting was stuck to my arm
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I pulled on it, it really hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, you're such a wuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you pull on your arm hair,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull some of that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cooler than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so high I couldn't feel my arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a donut frosting dingleberry in my
arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like donut frosting dingleberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just like the, donut frosting
dingleberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that you consider that for the name
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody will listen if we do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I warned them immediately when they were
coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're still with us, you guys are
soldiers, not soldier on.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, don't smoke as much as Clint did,
but smoke as much as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's funny because that's a good
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have probably consumed, since Clint's
been here, five dabs, I'm going to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five dabs at least since Clint's
been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two puffs off of that bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I've been smoking throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seven o'clock almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've probably had 12 dabs by now today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I smoked nothing all day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Clint is ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to let Clint drive for at
least another hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could pass any sobriety test that
you needed me to right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not even being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to burp, but I really could
pass almost any sobriety test you offered
[SPEAKER_00]: me at this point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your body chemistry,
where you're used to being, where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long your dreadlocks are.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long your dreadlocks are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's funny, dude, because I've seen
some people with dreads trying to be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can't keep up at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think because they got the dreads,
they're going to be able to party with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to carry them to the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drag them by the dreads right to the
couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drag them out in the front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody also sent me a message about trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, how do you feel about trim
machines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you're going to think I'm a
prick, but fuck a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trim machine ruins your trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a mess of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: High grade top shelf cannabis is hand
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim machines don't have fingers or eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mangle the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you've got a nice bud and you
run it through a trim machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to take off all the leaf in
one spot and it will take off some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud in some spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've helped other people use trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the Spin Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Grim or the Trim Reaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the Tsunami thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the way any of them work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what it does is it turns your trim
into a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It chops it up into this really funky
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it almost creates too many cuts
so that the moisture seeps out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves or the trim in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll mold up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost no way to prevent that shit
from turning moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to hand trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can separate the big leaves
from the good trim and you can know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making hash with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody's going to trim it like a
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the dispensaries, they've got a whole
crew of trimmers that hand trim
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't go as quickly as a trimmer,
but I think it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole bunch of 22 to 28-year-old
people that just want to trim all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eager to get into the cannabis
business and they just want to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just kick ass all day in hopes of
getting promoted to a blood tender or a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who does the trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have those six or eight people
sitting around trimming all day every day
[SPEAKER_00]: than two trim machines running,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking auto trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got fucking carpal tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I've got carpal tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got thumb calluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got forefinger calluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got wrist sores just from trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just from my Xbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from my Xbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably trimmed a hundred pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, more than a hundred pounds
of weed in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I've trimmed more than a
hundred pounds by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was a second half to that
question that somebody emailed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second half of that question is kind
of lengthy and I'm going to have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some research and give you a more thought
out answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not prepare enough time for that
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question and I will get
back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blowing it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I want to be accurate in a
little more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: More in depth for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that is a hell of a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know, it'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you, if you put out the call or
like if maybe somebody like that listens
[SPEAKER_04]: as a friend that has like a really great
weed story from like the seventies,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like one of those, like we had to
get away from the cops kind of things
[SPEAKER_04]: like, and, and how, how, how great it is
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want me to get some chongs on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinda.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually his medical marijuana
provider and he's an old cat and he loves
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell me stories, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had him on the podcast one time on seven
one nine, the blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember that when we put on the
headphones on him and put the microphone
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of him, something lit up inside
of him and his voice turned into like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got all spectacular and
charismatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the show, I was like,
dude, have you done this before?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, I did college radio,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing fucking like it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is college radio, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's our, it's a digital college
radio now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we got our like cult little
followers and shit and we'll listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and I'm sure that's not for me,
but I mean, that's I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So suck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every guest, even though you're a dick,
every guest that comes on brings their own
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'll, you'll retweet my tweet that
you're on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I tweet that, Hey,
tall Clint was on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of your three Twitter followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe if you have 10, maybe two of
them, we'll check out the show and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them will probably like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get another listener and then we
can bring Sam Talon on and then,
[SPEAKER_04]: and both cross paths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I really want everybody to hear Sam
Talon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invite him, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record 30 minutes and we'll put it
out as one of those Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about our fans and our
little cult following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really inspired me to say thank you
because I haven't said that enough lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been caught up in putting out a show
and keeping the guests entertained and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the flow happening for having a
sincerely said, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get so many downloads, so many listens,
the website traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pay for more bandwidth on my
website because you guys were killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downloading episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic on the website is exploding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to fix the file type that I upload
so that it's more available for Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: because people were downloading it so much
that it was slowing down the Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: application on their phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I changed the type of file that I
upload.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound as good, but nobody's
probably going to notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a voice podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we're putting out,
we can dance music or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, people are listening and I
really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've told a friend, we really
appreciate that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told Drew and Dustin about this because
I was like, no, I was really funny on this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was really funny back like,
jeez, I've been on this thing like eight
[SPEAKER_04]: times or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that you crashed the intro to.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just doing this podcast is fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You finally got your head bobbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're loving it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is nice, but it's nice to tell one
friend and then they tell one friend and
[SPEAKER_04]: then they tell one friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I'm asking is tell your
friend about Sam Talent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell your friends about Grow From Your
Heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, tell them about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the Sam Talent podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Sam Talent's coming down to do the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to get people out to that show,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so fucking, it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cliff's life is on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't go to the show,
his life is going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see, do I have any more notes
that I want to talk about on today's
[SPEAKER_00]: episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can almost, if you want to
fucking ramble on about something for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of minutes, man, what's your- How
long have we done now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone 33 minutes, but I imagine that
one to three minutes will be taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got about 30 minutes of usable
material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus, there was a depressing part in
there too, I hope, that does not make the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make you look dignified before this
comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be really funny if just during that
part you go, Clint wants you to come out
[SPEAKER_04]: to the show and you just edit that in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bunch of mumbles and then yeah,
please come to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please come to Clint's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will apologize for this air conditioner
that's making a whole bunch of damn noise
[SPEAKER_00]: over my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to take that out of the
recording, but I can hear it just going
[SPEAKER_00]: clink, clink, clink, clink in my head and
it's driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The producer in me absolutely bonkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking rad, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you got such a talent for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you, Corrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been doing, this is my 78th
episode on this show, and then I did about
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 on another show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a little bit of practice and I
think I finally got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a minute, but thanks for noticing
the improvements that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have actually said that
they've gone back and listened from
[SPEAKER_00]: episode number one up to whatever the
current episode is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of me makes me hang my head in
shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, you heard episodes one through
five where I was like, not sure what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but then I'm like, oh,
but that means you also heard 75 where I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew everything that I was doing by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know everything about a
podcast, but I feel like I can come on
[SPEAKER_00]: here and do a show now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, before it would take me
three hours worth of getting stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: together and being nervous and three
different takes of putting a show
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just like, what up,
podcast time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's neat then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll bet those people that have
listened to all of them feel like they
[SPEAKER_04]: know you pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun meeting those people,
because some people come out of nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like, dude, you're rusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hear my voice at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was like, you're that guy on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, man, how'd you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I can recognize your
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I hang out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to their house and take dabs and
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, but that's kind of what I'm
saying is if you listen, fucking let us
[SPEAKER_04]: know, dude, we're just human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all over Colorado, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I travel all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all over Colorado and I'll hang out
and take dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the show,
you're good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not taking dabs with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all heathens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint will come with me and he'll not take
dabs and he'll sit there and stare at you
[SPEAKER_04]: judgmentally.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be like a dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be looking at me like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish that we hadn't brought Jeff's dad
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you some dark glasses, bro,
and you can just be my security guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's security.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just need a mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the hair for the seventies,
so I think I could plan that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't going to mention your
feathered seventies hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's with that, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you filming porn when you leave here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a couple of things going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're way, way off topic,
what would be your porn name anyway?
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Frampton.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This screen name is not available.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fucking fun though, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Frampton underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spell the word underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I was thinking about it and I was
like, no, because then that's a pain in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ass and then you can't get the Twitter
handle because it's too long.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Frampton underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do what I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like fucking Peter Frampton though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it sells some porns too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next one, I'm Brent Michaels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frampton comes alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up this show here
really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 7-10 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Clint for coming on the
show and getting way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the answer to your question is
just don't get too high and do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be recorded while you're super high
because you may say some shit that you
[SPEAKER_00]: regret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to regret any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your friend is the producer and
he'll take all of it out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to regret
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say anything stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I've been doing this thing called
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periscope is an app that you can get on
your phone, either your iPhone or your
[SPEAKER_00]: Android device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go download Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you could do is follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at Rasta Jeff 420 on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, more than occasionally,
at least once, maybe twice a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump on Periscope and I will do a live
video where I sit here in the recording
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take big fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I take my morning dabs or my
afternoon dabs, whatever the first puff
[SPEAKER_00]: session of the day is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get on Periscope, take a few dabs
with you guys, talk a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: wisdom, drop some knowledge on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer a few questions if you type it
in the question box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I get good at recording the show,
setting the phone here in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer, getting on Periscope and
forgetting that Periscope is going and
[SPEAKER_00]: still paying attention to the chat in
Periscope, I will start doing a live show
[SPEAKER_00]: on Periscope as I record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you guys that are on Periscope with me
will be able to ask me questions live and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to read them on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read the question aloud into the
microphone and I'll be like, so Tal Clint
[SPEAKER_00]: says, how come you don't ever brush your
hair?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll answer the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I hear that so much on Periscope?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm troll-proof, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have not just said that on the
podcast because now they want to challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: my troll game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am troll-proof on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got dreadlocks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to fucking make me cry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing is nobody's ever
said anything original anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always like, oh, I heard that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's tough about comedy too because
there's a lot of jokes that have been
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're just trying to do new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But troll-proof is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Troll-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should make a screen name or something
that's troll-proof because I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: troll-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grown ass man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite secure with myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do troll-proof on Periscope right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just type it in as the thing and then have
everybody just say mean things that you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on the show though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll do that right after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check me out on
Periscope once in a while though,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I come on late at night,
early in the morning, random times,
[SPEAKER_00]: just take fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a really weird schedule being
employed and self-employed and being a
[SPEAKER_00]: producer of a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hours are really random.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to bed around four in the morning and
get up around somewhere between nine and
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, sometimes 11 if I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun comes up and I just start getting
up and doing shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way it's got to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got to hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often I'm up by nine o'clock because
some of the grow lights come on at nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, sometimes I got to be at the spot by
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, I got to get a fucking job,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint had a great comedy set.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day Clint got relieved of his position
at his spot of employment and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: drove up and watched him do comedy and
that comedy set was quite awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was the wife that was about
to get beat because you were the husband
[SPEAKER_00]: that lost his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty mad that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell, but we're doing everything
we could to put you in a better head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, you guys did good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you're in a much better
space than like 40 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're just... No, everybody's all in
this all together, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's happening for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the damn truth, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been rambling for 40 minutes.
Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I warned you immediately too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't warn me as the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: He all got the warning at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff got the front of this one because you
guys had the opportunity to not listen to
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to edit some of this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's going to have to listen to this
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice, because I'll listen to it as I edit
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's complete, I'll give it
one full complete listen through just to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it's... Yeah, it doesn't sound
shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I didn't do any hard P's or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even fix the hard P's and S's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the software does most of that for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that's cool that you're
getting help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got this piece over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this piece over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my daughter calling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want me to turn down your mic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that him?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's got to step away for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, now the show's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your comment on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave a comment on Stitcher if
you'd like, but it's really hard to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go and look, but Stitcher is really
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find me on all the social media sites,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast, or it's just at
GFYH.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget the show's available on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher and every single episode is
archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint has jumped back on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything cool, brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everything's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just when your daughter calls you,
you answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been bragging about her birthday on
the past couple episodes, and if she
[SPEAKER_00]: called right now, we would talk to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a nine-year-old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what dads do, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Answer when the girl calls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate all your fans and everything,
but that's the one thing that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many things that we stopped recording
for, but the daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't that great?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually good people too.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a foul mouth sailor of a person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the analogy I was going for
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: A comedian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that guy's a dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the little ones first, bro,
because that's… Can you edit out all the
[SPEAKER_04]: fucks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, I did what was called the
dollar fuck jar, and the money got donated
[SPEAKER_00]: to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the money is sitting somewhere,
and that dude has not contacted me,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he doesn't listen to the show anymore,
so my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of money, there's a donation
button on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the website, it's
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the Grow From Your Heart Podcast
tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's top right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a donation button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little PayPal logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm not begging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just letting you know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is always going to be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes to you from me as a gift
because I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to break the stigma and fears
associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to help out the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to free the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is all free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do feel like making a
contribution, I would love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give you a shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the PayPal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw in however much you feel like you'd
like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, run all the social media
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bet your fans fucking hate me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only going to get like 30 minutes
of your ear bashing, so it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, thanks for tolerating Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise he won't be on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't have him back for a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should get Spence here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get a few other new people
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of news lined up for the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already stuff in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get shirts made by episode
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you in the next one.
I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep the dad nail hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a lot of what we're going to talk
about may be kind of regional to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust a lot of what we
say for your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in California, you may be a
little bit earlier than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the East Coast, it's going to
be a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to teach you to grow
in the South or in the East where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot more humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scheduling is a lot more wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Midwest is pretty similar to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a lot easier for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll get most of this stuff based on
Colorado grows, but we'll try to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody can work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess the first question we should
start with is where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should we look at growing our
outdoor crop or would be our ideal space?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a south facing or good southern
view for the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting this one off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come at you eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can edit some stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: No need for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want, you know, probably six hours a
day direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll grow on less, but,
you know, for proper, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want six plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer like 10 hours a day personally,
but I mean, can make it work outdoors is
[SPEAKER_02]: really forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow an accident sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want a south facing slope if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we're stuck like in the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we're in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to avoid some sheds,
street lights if you can?
[SPEAKER_02]: Street lights, most definitely sheds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't want to get too
blocked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is mainly for airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if your area is, you know,
like in the middle of four sheds or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that all stacked together,
but it's 20 by 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got plenty of airflow there
for a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave some space for the plants to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's like a six by six spot,
you know, that's enough for one plant
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you guys, your outdoor plants
are going to get big if you do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in a few minutes
when we talk about container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you would like a southern facing
slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow in your backyard
or something, don't grow between the
[SPEAKER_00]: garage and the house and the shed unless
you can get plenty of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flowing through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's too high and my throat's all
chapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want your plants touching each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you do plant them, make sure you
give like, expect the plants to be six to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight feet around each by the time you're
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit bigger if you're a good
grower and you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, expect a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself plenty of room is kind of
what I was headed toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we might be behind on this question,
but here in Colorado, when should we put
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much anywhere in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could have been out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of weeks ago, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summer we've had here locally,
you could have been out at first of May
[SPEAKER_02]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask a really random question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locally, we've been getting beat to shit
with hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: For two weeks, we had hail every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does one deal with torrential hail
storms like that in a ganja farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: You get real good at seeing hail storms
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the tarps up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You watch tarps, buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: With our in-ground plants, the hail storm
that actually hit our place, we were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to put 55-gallon trash buckets over each
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flip it upside down and give it a
little hut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were bigger further in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about a hoop house in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the hoop house get fucked up from that
hail?
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a shade cloth on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about a hoop house toward the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about it on a previous episode,
but we should rewind on that one when we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, it totally got fucked up by
hail though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to fuck some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's going to go wrong, but you always
get next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll salvage something out of your
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You almost always get something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless thieves or cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing that's going to take
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny because I've got the word
thieves and cops written on a note later
[SPEAKER_00]: on in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we're on the same page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, it would be on a field in
Humboldt County or somewhere toward Gila
[SPEAKER_00]: or out in Rye on a south-facing slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a big 18 foot tall chain link fence
where nobody can get in, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to happen for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to want these plants,
plenty of space between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about this
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm skipping ahead, but Jesse said you can
put them out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I thought about all the weather we've
been getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go right to the hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the ideal outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to go outdoors cheap to
protect everything, I think a hoop house
[SPEAKER_00]: might be the best option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's also the best way to get the
best resin production in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just straight up outdoor tends to get
dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making concentrates,
you're going to make dust concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beaten by the sun, rained on, all that
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A simple hoop house covering can save you
a lot of headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can create a couple too.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's tall enough, realize the
strain you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a little research, figure out how much
you're going to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've done this before, you know
what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get big outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan for the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you have plenty of airflow at
the top of the greenhouse and at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh air in and old steel air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as important as in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humid air too, because the plants are
transpiring and the plastic traps the
[SPEAKER_02]: water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's real quickly, if you could describe
to me how to build just a hoop house that
[SPEAKER_00]: would fit in my backyard, maybe just like
a 10 by 20 at the biggest, what would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the most, just two or three minutes worth
of how to build a hoop house?
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think how simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the frame, the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so take like, what size did you
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a 10 by 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 by 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll need 40 foot of lumber there or
30 foot of lumber there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to carry the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So build your frame just like a big box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secure it to the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to secure it to the
ground, but it'll help.
[SPEAKER_10]: The way shit's been around here lately,
I would secure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And inside that frame, just bend your PVC
tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, use like probably 20 foot tube
or something like, or 20 foot stick on
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's going to end you up
with I think somewhere around a seven foot
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure on that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just continue down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this over 20 foot span,
you'd probably want, I'd recommend at
[SPEAKER_02]: least seven, probably go for more like
eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing, so you've got a
rectangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a rectangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10 by 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we're going to do,
why we call it a hoop house, we're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC tubing and it almost looks like you're
just using hula hoops and building a long
[SPEAKER_00]: tube, but you've make an arch from,
and we're doing it the 10 foot to 10 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: side, not the 20 inch or the 20 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go from one 10, you just make an
arch and that way it makes it about seven
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall and then it's 10 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do those about every two or
three, three or four feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, depending on how much wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the prairie in Southern Colorado,
I'd probably recommend it three foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about every three feet, put another PVC
tube and attach that to the box somehow,
[SPEAKER_00]: to your base.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use to attach it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a conduit clamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also run a lag bolt through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only run one bolt through there and I
drill it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had them, what would you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wallow their way out and it rips the PVC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's always fun when you get a
spring boarded PVC pipe just flipping up
[SPEAKER_02]: in the middle of the night.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So catapult some shit across the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you got the supports going over
and then do you put one across the middle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd actually recommend three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're thinking of it like a clock,
there'd be one at 12 o'clock, one at nine
[SPEAKER_02]: o 'clock and one at two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nine and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got this like arch looking
building with a beam that goes down the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle on the top and then down the three
o'clock angle, down the nine o'clock
[SPEAKER_00]: angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels pretty secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you attach that top hole and the
side, the beams that come across?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fence posts is the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dig a fence post at the end of each
end of the greenhouse on a 20 foot one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want one in the middle too and
just arrange the sides so that it meets up
[SPEAKER_02]: with that skeleton beam and fasten it to
it with more conduit clamps.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you've done this several dozen
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now pretty much looks like we've got
the skeleton figured out basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we use for a cover,
for a top for this thing to keep the hail
[SPEAKER_00]: and rain off of our beautiful plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're low in budget, a visqueen or
just poly plastic from those works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the heavier, thicker mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got a better budget,
we sell greenhouse fabrics, lots of places
[SPEAKER_02]: sell greenhouse fabrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ranges, I want to say it's
somewhere, hell, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it goes up to like 10 bucks a
square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it starts off way cheaper than
that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 10 is high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, you can afford this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys work a little bit through the
winter, you can build this next summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely have you an outdoor.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we covered up, how do you secure
the cover there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do they call them?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a battery jumper cable
clamp.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little alligator clamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But better, but stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them spring clamps, but I don't
think that's what the... And the nipple
[SPEAKER_00]: clamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Framing clamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get them for like 250 at Harbor
Freight.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go buy a whole bucket of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten in there and bought like four
buckets of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask, lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got this little hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should put a fan in the top guys,
like in one of the peaks at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out the shape of the fan and hang a
fan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to need to get some
air in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do a blower, like a grow room
blower, that's even cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those work great on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do one coming in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that sucks about those is
though, they suck up rocks and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them have plastic blades in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take you a piece of ducting that's,
I don't know, like three foot long and
[SPEAKER_02]: secure it to the side of the greenhouse,
lift it up a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: attach it to the fan so that it can't suck
any rocks off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to know what that sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like keys in the blender,
I could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got air in, we've got air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice little greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to save that question right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of soil should we use?
[SPEAKER_02]: That depends on your budget and just your
grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we put them straight into the dirt,
do you think, or should we use pots?
[SPEAKER_02]: It also depends on your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tend to recommend pots,
even though I would rather be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend planting in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a little more to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go get like a 30 gallon smart pot
outdoors, I recommend the fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sell the tan ones now too,
which are great because they reflect heat
[SPEAKER_02]: a little better than the black ones that
tend to absorb heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I mean, if you just went
with your favorite potting soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, I recommend probably going
three times bigger in your typical indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And large containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick with your regular nutrient schedule,
you know, stick with what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you want to do organics,
I could spend a whole episode talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some episodes with Sean,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are all about amending soil and there
are great outdoor mixes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's personally the way I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of my plants, I mean, we do six
plants in the ground and we do six plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in the light depth greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones in the ground have been grown in
that soil for eight years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones in the greenhouse get my homemade
mixture, which is real similar to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots organic is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get the, you know, personally I
grow organic, so they get teas and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been playing around with ferments and
stuff like that, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't they love a nice tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed them a nice tea, those plants
take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with the Kashi juice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got these plants in a nice
Kashi juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, I could go off on a whole rant
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, it almost flew over my head,
but as low Kashi juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't know what, what is that a
lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that purple stuff and the fungacy
stuff looking stuff is basically great
[SPEAKER_00]: white shark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all kinds of names for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like beard, bar trash can puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this nice little light depth
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some plants in really large pots
or not light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we didn't do light depth on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may discuss that a little more in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in light depth,
it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the plastic on, you take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get another tarp to cover up the sun
so that you can schedule the bitches to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to sleep every night at a specific time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like digging ditches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could teach anyone to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we talk about it in a past
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go more over that one in the future
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got them in this little hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got large pots with decent soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeding nutrients that you're
familiar with or a bottle nutrient line
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's probably cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, our friend Sean will teach you a
great soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find the episode number and insert
that in the notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor plants tend to use a little more
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I've grown bottled nutrients
outdoors, we normally feed to the top end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If maybe even just a little over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this was with general organic
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plants can metabolize more
because of the sun and the more available
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 and the bigger root mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think your gavitas are bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ain't got nothing on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun will kick your gavitas ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me what kind of lights to
use and I was like, gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I've got low ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, stick with your like
LumaTex or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those magnums or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when should we expect to see signs
of flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Late July, early August in Southern
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on what strains we're working
with, I'd imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica's seem to tend, or I would say in
my experience, Indica's go a little
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow will take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry will be almost done by the time
Golden Goat spits out pistols.
[SPEAKER_02]: My government mule just kills it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of mules, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of problems do you think we
should tell the people to be prepared for?
[SPEAKER_02]: We get those damn little moths.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn into caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they bore into your bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing light dip and it's early
season, you got to watch out for molds,
[SPEAKER_02]: bud rot, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that can be stopped once
it's happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could spend, well, I don't
know, PMs of a bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I personally don't think a little
on a fan leaf here or there right before
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest is one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's on the bud, it's done,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud rot, I have just seen that for the
first time this year ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in another light dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, guys, get that circulation up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had a very rainy spring and lots
of hell and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the humidity has been so much
higher than a lot of outdoor growers are
[SPEAKER_02]: used to dealing with around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using swamp coolers to try to
cool the house on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: His harvest was by no means a total loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably lost a plant combined out of,
I think he did 12 plants in there or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rule of averages with growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it was PM where you can
smell it on buds that weren't even
[SPEAKER_02]: affected and stuff like that, or at least
what I've seen so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we deal with animals?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of animals do you think we're
going to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deer love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cows love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that eats stuff loves it,
especially when it's well cared for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you know, just prepare for the
animals in your area, even cats and dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say cats, rabbits,
squirrels, all the domestic fucking pest
[SPEAKER_00]: animals are going to come at it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to section it off somehow so these
animals don't get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we treat for bugs outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory on outdoor growing, and you can
correct me if I'm wrong, you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we don't fuck with nature,
nature will kind of take care of itself
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I spray, I'm going to upset
the whole system and a bug that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: normally dominate will dominate because
whatever should have been there to eat it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I grow, I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use very minimal pesticides,
very strategic timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a greenhouse, it depends on how sealed
up your greenhouse is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times it's just like a grow room
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a lot harder for insects and
parasites to survive outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the best grow room in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got perfect airflow and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as the plants are happy,
aren't stressed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Azimax is probably the strongest
thing I've ever used outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about spinosad?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something you can do to go after
the moths and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something, I mean, we have bees on
our property too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's always a consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But spinosad is something that we don't
really worry about at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like spraying a tea on the plants,
which we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually, it derives from a bacteria
found in the bottle of a rum jar or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of a rum jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a rum barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the wood has something to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that a long time ago somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Jax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Captain Jax to the rescue sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about all the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be prepared for a lot of weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be treacherous out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine being stuck outside all the time
and not being able to come inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to prepare for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to build them a dog
house or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need love.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I thought we should mention
is be prepared for a lot of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are prepared or
realize how much water your outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you water your outdoor
plants, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, up until, you know, normally it's
once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year has been a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had to water as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually been a pain in the fucking
ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my plants are severely stunted
because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll dry out here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be missing that evening rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else was I going to ask you?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of flowering, when they
start budding out in the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to be watering them twice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably so.
[SPEAKER_02]: In-ground plants don't need to be watered
as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you water them right, you know,
15, 20 gallons at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a workout when we do outdoor
in-ground watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the greenhouse, I use an automated
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put little sprinklers and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that just tells you how much water,
you know, even smart pots need outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun just bakes those pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Lowe's or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fill the side of one of their,
you know, of a rose pot or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that sitting outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the sun just bakes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets so fucking hot and that gets your
roots hot, which they can survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need plenty of water to be able
to handle it.
So.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you said to put mulch on top of your
pots also to shade them a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep moisture in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In-ground, don't worry in the pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, if you do have black pots
outside, I recommend wrapping them in
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic with the white side up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they don't get dried out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them a little reflective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of absorbing all that black heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that three, started doing that three
years ago and it seemed to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'd like to figure out for these
people is some no-till, talk with Sean,
[SPEAKER_02]: some future stuff about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till is neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year it was kind of a last minute
opportunity for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they got the required licensing
and everything, they just went with what
[SPEAKER_02]: they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which wasn't much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before my computer starts tripping out too
much here, do you have any tips for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are starting to grow outdoors
for the first time this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in-ground, just make sure the
water is soaking down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it starts pulling up, give it a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how long it takes it for it to drain
down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives you a real good indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of how damp the soil is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A container is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to, through trial and
error, figure out how much water to put in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much it should weigh in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long it takes to dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The earth can be a little more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: To aid in that watering, put a frame
around the plant, like a three foot by
[SPEAKER_02]: three foot, two by four frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also attach the big crazy tomato
cages or plant cages made out of fencing
[SPEAKER_02]: to them later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a frog in my throat now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for 30 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of a podcast for these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let your throat take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat finally is not blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good time to do a closing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll take some dabs now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll save some stuff for next time here.
