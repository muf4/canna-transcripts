[SPEAKER_02]: an Instagram live feed and somebody tried
to throw out some German and I responded
[SPEAKER_02]: in German and the whole room just went
silent the entire chat stopped I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: well I apologize for that I thought that
was funny welcome to the show ladies and
[SPEAKER_02]: gentlemen welcome Mike's on the show we're
gonna do a show about what are we gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about determining ripeness and when
to harvest your cannabis plants before we
[SPEAKER_02]: get there you know I like to start the
episodes by stock by talk by stalking
[SPEAKER_02]: about yeah let's let's talk about let's
talk about what I've been dabbing that was
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to say I've been taking dabs of some
viola labs clementine cookies live resin
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm opening it up to smell it right now it
is like spicy orange candy and I really
[SPEAKER_02]: love the smell and flavor of this I picked
up three grams today when I went I usually
[SPEAKER_02]: just get one gram of each flavor and it's
like do they have more of that they do
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just take three and I will be on my
way Mike is it time to change that
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone cover is that what you're
subliminally telling me right now it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: a furry spot but I've got malamute so I'm
used to furry spots we're gonna blame that
[SPEAKER_03]: on your malamutes it's not malamute hair
but it's not hippie hair either so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: cool just pulling it off and rolling with
it welcome to the furry spot podcast

[SPEAKER_02]: home you're just freaking out you know
what bust out your phone check out your PL
[SPEAKER_02]: minder unit you can see what's going on
your grow room at all times how do you get
[SPEAKER_02]: a PL grow how do you get a PL minder unit
you go to PL grow dot systems that's how
[SPEAKER_02]: check them out at PL grow dot systems you
guys appeal grow systems minder unit will
[SPEAKER_02]: let you know what's going on in your grow
room at all times you can relax you can
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy what you're doing it's awesome all
right let's move forward uh YouTube you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys all of the YouTube videos are caught
up I did it took a long time but they are
[SPEAKER_03]: finally there that was a multi-year
project YouTube got evil right before
[SPEAKER_02]: confusion right at the scariest time yeah
I was just about caught up and then all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the YouTube channels started disappearing
I don't put videos of myself consuming on
[SPEAKER_02]: this channel that might be your saving
grace so yeah I talk heavily about it but
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't see it so unless they're
looking for it and someone reports it we
[SPEAKER_02]: should be okay we'll see how long it lasts
either way if it does disappear I'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: a new place to put it don't worry um
YouTube is uh that's just another place
[SPEAKER_02]: for more people to listen to the show I
think we'll probably get more more listens
[SPEAKER_02]: more views more interactions all right
Mike you got anything to say before we
[SPEAKER_02]: start talking about um determining
ripeness on cannabis plants you got any
[SPEAKER_02]: topics you want to bring before we get on
a ramble here not yet we'll just see where
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes Mike says we'll see where this
takes us all right so a lot of people were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking on Instagram live and on chat
rooms right now about how to decide when
[SPEAKER_02]: to harvest their cannabis when is my
cannabis ripe um the seed packs are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell you a certain time frame they're
going to say 56 to 63 days they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to say 63 to 70 days they're going to say
9 to 10 weeks the first time you run that
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of seeds I would say go the longest
time frame that they give you as an option
[SPEAKER_02]: at least plan for it for sure yes yeah if
it says 10 week 9 to 10 weeks go the 10
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks because maybe in that last week
that's when you're going to see extra
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes pack on you're going to see the
extra weight come on you're going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some cool colors you might you may
you may see some shit you don't see if you
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it down at week 9 so let it go 10
weeks if it says 10 weeks if it says 56 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 63 days let it go 63 let it go 65 if it
looks okay and see what happens so that
[SPEAKER_02]: being said the way to determine ripeness
of your cannabis plants is not by looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at the hairs it is not by looking at the
shape of the buds it's not by looking at I
[SPEAKER_03]: did air quotes when I said I'm just I'm
hearing different people throughout my
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis career like speaking at length
about how all of those are telltale signs
[SPEAKER_03]: of like either perfect herb or good herb
or completed herb not ready to harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: herb and it's all nonsense yeah what we
are growing cannabis for the viable part
[SPEAKER_02]: that we want are the trichomes why would
we look at anything but the trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: right we want to harvest those when
they're at their ripest point so we should
[SPEAKER_02]: be paying attention to the trichomes the
only way you can do that you can if
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody tells you they can see the
trichomes with their naked eye either
[SPEAKER_02]: steal their eyes or kick them in the dick
because they're a liar you cannot see
[SPEAKER_02]: amber trichomes without some sort of
magnification you need at least 60x maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 100x magnification to see if a trichome is
clear cloudy silver milky amber busted
[SPEAKER_02]: ruptured if the head's broken off of it
you need magnification you cannot see that
[SPEAKER_02]: with the naked eye and if you can you're
fucking awesome send me a message I want
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear about it yep good get on Amazon
start looking at scopes folks yeah get
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself like a jeweler's loop I have a
scope from dyno light that hooks up to my
[SPEAKER_02]: computer I plug it right into the USB slot
it took me just a few minutes to mess with
[SPEAKER_02]: the drivers to make it link up to my
computer once it linked up it was no
[SPEAKER_02]: problem ever I open up the application I'm
able to run the scope over the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: I can focus it in and I can see those
trichomes very large on my computer screen
[SPEAKER_02]: and it makes it very and I can take
pictures so if I can't tell exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at I can reach over and I
think I press F11 and I take a photo right
[SPEAKER_02]: there boom then I can go look later and I
can see if that plants ripe or not the the
[SPEAKER_03]: computerized scope makes life a lot easier
but you can pick up something kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a jeweler's loop that's a lot less
expensive and just as functional the 420
[SPEAKER_02]: scope will work for you just a basic
jeweler's loop will work for you there's
[SPEAKER_02]: one that hydrofarm sells it spreads in
half it's got batteries in it then it
[SPEAKER_02]: splits in half and the batteries are on
one side and the optics are actually on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other side they make a 60 and a 100x I
would recommend the 100x if you go for
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's probably the best one on the
market if you're gonna get something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that that I'm aware of there's probably
something better by now but get to
[SPEAKER_02]: magnification magnification will help you
out in so many ways you'll be able to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: if your trichomes are clear if they're
silver if they're cloudy if they're milky
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're amber if they're ruptured also
you'll be able to identify the pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: the funguses and the problems on the
underside of your leaves more accurately
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got a scope to look at those
things it's a really useful tool
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the growth cycle for sure yeah
once you've got all of your tools dialed
[SPEAKER_02]: in and you've got some money to spend on a
couple of extra toys for the grow room get
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself a scope it will really help a
scope or a loop or something that hooks up
[SPEAKER_02]: to your computer all right so the hairs
are not gonna tell you how ready your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is Mike just tapped his headphones
are you too hot there no just got an itch
[SPEAKER_02]: all right scratch it up buddy good boy
good boy his legs starting to go because
[SPEAKER_02]: he's scratching behind us here you guys
switching all right the only thing that's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna tell you if your cannabis plants are
ripe are the trichomes we're growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes that's what we want if you're
growing to make quality flowers if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna make edibles if you're gonna make
extracts if you're gonna make anything the
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes are what matter so pay attention
to that nothing else now the way that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could tell the trichomes you're gonna see
the trichomes develop on your plant if you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a scope and you can pay attention
through the entire process do that watch
[SPEAKER_02]: those trichomes go from a little bitty
stock watch them develop ahead watch the
[SPEAKER_02]: head of that trichome fill up you'll watch
it fill up it'll get juicy and then it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start to change colors it'll go from clear
then it'll slowly turn to like a silverish
[SPEAKER_02]: color then it'll get cloudy you'll be once
you see it you'll know right now you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going what does he mean by cloudy you've
got a imagine if you got a fishbowl and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you put some dish soap in there and
stirred it up it's cloudy that's what your
[SPEAKER_02]: cloudy trichomes are gonna look like
that's cloudy now your next step after
[SPEAKER_02]: cloudy is milky sometimes they turn kind
of bluish in my opinion they have a hint
[SPEAKER_03]: of blue they have that if you stare at
like certain white paints and whatnot
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll start to see a blue kind of
undertone a little bit yeah yeah and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah a nice patch of milky trichomes i
always see just a little hint of light
[SPEAKER_02]: blue in there so the fishbowl i talked
about a minute ago imagine if i took your
[SPEAKER_02]: fishbowl that had we dumped out the dish
soap because this is just going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: gross if we keep adding stuff i'm gross
let's do this differently imagine if you
[SPEAKER_02]: took a fishbowl that's got water in it and
you poured just enough milk in there to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it turn light white light white not
it's not going to be fucking boom like ice
[SPEAKER_02]: cream but it's going to be light white
like you poured some creamer in your
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee you just lighten it up you can see
it now now that trichome is what i would
[SPEAKER_02]: call milky that is a milky trichome uh
you're almost ready for harvest the next
[SPEAKER_02]: step that's going to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to look like you had a spray
bottle a couple of them get this amber
[SPEAKER_02]: color this doctor pepper color right
across them and you're going to see it
[SPEAKER_02]: happen toward the top and kind of right in
the middle and then keep pay attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole plant it's going to move around
but when you see that first bit of amber
[SPEAKER_02]: really start paying attention because
you've got a very short time now they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start that amber is going to
start progressing throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: really quickly and when you look at the
the scope and you can see you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to look around the plant when 30
percent of those trichomes start becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: amber that's when you want to cut down 30
percent now i say look in several places
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be like 30 percent how do
i know when i can see a hundred trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: in there just look around and use your
best judgment you guys about 25 to 35
[SPEAKER_02]: percent is where you want to aim for
you're not going to notice a difference if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a few days off on your harvest
honestly you are not going to notice a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge difference you've got a drying cure
period once you cut down these plants
[SPEAKER_02]: those trichomes are going to continue to
change all the way until the moment you
[SPEAKER_02]: combust them you're going to cut them down
you've got this dry period they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get beat up and harvest they're going
to get cured they're going to change
[SPEAKER_02]: there's going to be so many different
changes in those trichomes so just a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days in your harvest window will
not make a huge difference you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to notice it it's not going to hurt
your feelings so pay attention to those
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes get yourself a scope they're
going to go clear then they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn silver then they're going to get
cloudy that's when it starts getting
[SPEAKER_02]: excited they're filled it's getting
exciting they're filling up with trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: are with uh cannabinoids now they've got
different things in there different
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive ingredients inside of there
that are changing every day then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get milky they're going to turn a
little bit blue then they're going to look
[SPEAKER_02]: like i sprayed them with dr pepper when
three out of ten when 30 percent of them
[SPEAKER_02]: have that dr pepper stain on them that's
when it's time to cut so you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: say but it's my first grow with this plant
how how do i plan that how do i properly
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to flush and look out for
trichomes to be amber i thought of a great
[SPEAKER_02]: way that we can all be safe keep in mind
this isn't going to be the last time
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing the strain hopefully this
is the first time you grew it that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know when the trichomes are
going to change colors that's why you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know how long it's going to take
it's the first time you're developing a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with this plant the first
time you got to learn it the second third
[SPEAKER_02]: time you dial it in the fourth and fifth
time you fucking perfect this grow so
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just learning this one so keep
think about it this way if you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: a 60 day plant if the package says grow it
for 55 to 60 days go that 60 days if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to go for 60 days flush it
day 50 and really start paying attention
[SPEAKER_02]: to those trichomes if you want to cut it
down at a specific day just make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: flushed seven to ten days pretty heavily
i'd like to go 14 but seven to ten days
[SPEAKER_02]: should be plenty if you want to let your
plant go 70 days if you've got something i
[SPEAKER_02]: bred you probably want to let it go 70
days if i bred it 70 days no problem start
[SPEAKER_02]: flushing at day six 60 and pay attention
to your trichomes you can cut down at day
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 if you don't feel like it's ready let
it go a little bit longer it doesn't need
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients to keep going it's just going to
start getting tired but then you can give
[SPEAKER_02]: it time to ripen up so i think the way to
judge when to harvest your cannabis is by
[SPEAKER_02]: paying attention to the trichomes if you
don't have a way to look at the trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have a way to accurately judge
the ripeness of your cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: you run the risk of cutting them way too
early is what most people do if you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're done wait three to five more
days if you can wait seven more days wait
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're only going to get better
and don't cut too early because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: anxious and eager patience you cut clones
or you grew from seeds and those took time
[SPEAKER_02]: then you vegged it out you spent a lot of
money on nutrients you've already spent
[SPEAKER_02]: you're probably going to put 115 days into
it why not put 122 what's another week
[SPEAKER_02]: right i know you start getting itchy you
start getting that the crack head lips and
[SPEAKER_02]: you start scratching your neck you know
like yeah i want to cut it down i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking of a friend of mine who was
always in that clip-in lower nut you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: start at the bottom of the plant start
taking nugs and um drying them out as fast
[SPEAKER_03]: as he could to keep himself covered and by
the time he got to harvest it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: like the top coal is left on the plan yeah
and then there's nothing to enjoy because
[SPEAKER_02]: you fast-ried everything and you could
have just had one huge harvest and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually saw a harvest and see you could
see what it looks like what your work
[SPEAKER_02]: actually did instead of just destroying
your work slowly and not getting any
[SPEAKER_02]: reward yeah so be patient you guys that's
that's one of the main things that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to learn when you're growing cannabis
sometimes you just need to hide your
[SPEAKER_02]: scissors uh send mike home with the
scissors be like bro take these so that i
[SPEAKER_02]: can't cut my plants up you're like uh
you're on suicide watch or something just
[SPEAKER_02]: take these bros i can't fuck up so uh i
guess that was a pretty quick way to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: but i mean that's right to the point
there's no other way to explain that uh
[SPEAKER_02]: get a jeweler's loop get some sort of
magnification and look at your trichomes i
[SPEAKER_02]: know i keep saying it we're growing for
trichomes we don't care about all that
[SPEAKER_03]: leafy green shit you just got to get in
there with some magnification and spend
[SPEAKER_02]: some time reading the plan yeah we don't
we're not worried about all the green
[SPEAKER_02]: leafy part i mean that part tastes good
that's fun to smoke that's a cool carrier
[SPEAKER_02]: but the trichomes are the goal so make
sure they're ripe um something that i
[SPEAKER_02]: should add if you are growing for
concentrates uh maybe cut a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: early start flushing early and harvest a
little bit early because once the if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want nice and clear concentrates maybe
this is some industry secrets secrets i
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't be sharing with the general
public but here you go guys i love you and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is free if you want nice and clear
concentrates cut your plants down before
[SPEAKER_02]: the trichomes start getting dark if they
start getting dark what you're extracting
[SPEAKER_02]: is trichomes your concentrates will come
out a little bit darker cut them down when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're nice and clear and guess what nice
and clear concentrates it's easier a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of a lot of concentrate makers can make
super clear concentrates out of everything
[SPEAKER_02]: now but it's easier it's less to clean up
it's less work if you're pulling it down
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have got nice and clear trichomes
early in process quickly yep they cut them
[SPEAKER_02]: down i don't even want to tell you what
week sometimes like week seven ish i've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen it go for concentrates yeah a little
bit ridiculous but then you can pull a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole one more harvest a year if you cut
everything down at the end of week six
[SPEAKER_02]: that you could fill one more harvest a
year in your schedule that's business
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately you guys do not do that be
patient let it go long enough let it be
[SPEAKER_02]: done like axel rose said all we need is
just a little patience mike just gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: the funniest look all right you guys hey
mike do you got any political stuff you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to talk about for a minute some
there's always some um good news this week
[SPEAKER_03]: for uh medical cannabis consumers or
patients whichever you prefer down in
[SPEAKER_03]: florida um a judge down there ruled that
they can finally consume their cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: products by combustion and inhalation they
made smoking marijuana legal finally for
[SPEAKER_03]: medical patients down there up until
recently they were sort of insisting that
[SPEAKER_03]: people use non-smokable or vapeable forms
so they were only able to use tinctures
[SPEAKER_03]: topicals capsules and edibles and edibles
but that's okay edibles oils tinctures all
[SPEAKER_03]: right i mean it's it's quite a variety of
products and in florida is really just
[SPEAKER_03]: getting off the ground but uh can they dab
concentrates now um i'm actually i'm this
[SPEAKER_03]: has this literally just happened this
morning okay so but they can at least
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a bowl now they can smoke a joint
which is why a lot of us choose cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's that's how it's immediately
effective you can get an immediate effect
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can titrate your dose perfectly
perfectly like the first time out the door
[SPEAKER_03]: no but by the time you're like
successfully treating a pain disorder or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that like i can consume
exactly to the point of no pain right and
[SPEAKER_03]: then if i choose to consume further into
the points of enjoyment i can choose to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that or stop i know about where my medical
needs are i know about how many dabs it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes for me to meet my my medical
requirements and then i know about when i
[SPEAKER_02]: start going recreational i know where that
line is and then i know how to sustain
[SPEAKER_02]: that medical and i also know how to cross
that line whenever i need to so yeah we
[SPEAKER_02]: should be allowed to uh well i'm glad that
florida is allowed to consume properly now
[SPEAKER_03]: for a while that was just a federal
patient or two down there that could smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody else had to to eat but now it's
everybody was that our buddy that's our
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy herbs our buddy herb shout out to
herb if y'all don't know who erv rozenfeld
[SPEAKER_03]: is hop on youtube and have prepared to
have your mind fucking blown away yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy can smoke whenever wherever let's
just say when you think of the world
[SPEAKER_03]: record holder for most joints consumed per
lifetime you don't think of a jewish
[SPEAKER_03]: stockbroker in florida but you should
speaking of a lot of joints smoked happy
[SPEAKER_02]: birthday to tommy chong happy birthday
tommy i think he's 80 this weekend javes
[SPEAKER_02]: old as fuck bro he's not here man so shout
out to our friends down there in florida
[SPEAKER_02]: finally able to do it right yeah welcome
to the club florida how many of those uh
[SPEAKER_02]: retired folk down there in florida are the
cannabis consumers is that part of who's
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming do you think oh for sure for
sure um one of the the fun little data
[SPEAKER_03]: points out of colorado is our medical
program the average age is 42 nice and
[SPEAKER_03]: that was when you and me were in our 20s
and early 30s in it and it was still well
[SPEAKER_03]: into the 40s and that's because boomers
are a huge cannabis consuming population
[SPEAKER_03]: they uh it's a population with a lot of
aches and pains and if they can treat
[SPEAKER_03]: those in a way that doesn't sunk them out
and they can enjoy those years
[SPEAKER_03]: substantially more because they choose to
use cannabis instead of opioids for their
[SPEAKER_03]: pain or trying to choose with just dealing
with their pain like they dive right on it
[SPEAKER_02]: the topicals the edibles they love it all
i think it's a uh a great social lubricant
[SPEAKER_02]: and a great alternative to alcohol i
cannot uh i can't manage alcohol and so
[SPEAKER_02]: when i once i start drinking uh we're just
gonna drink and it's not gonna be a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: ending like that's just how my alcohol
consumption goes i cannot do to myself
[SPEAKER_02]: with dabs and cannabis what i'm able to do
to myself with alcohol so i think just a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of you know you just smoke with
people you just pass around a pipe it
[SPEAKER_02]: creates that when you pass around a pipe
together you just created friendship you
[SPEAKER_02]: know hey i hit this you hit this we both
consume the same thing let's be friends
[SPEAKER_02]: now i think it's just becoming more of an
acceptable social lubricant as well it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not so taboo uh more people are willing to
admit that they consume cannabis which is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of nice a lot of people used to only
smoke behind closed doors it's fun
[SPEAKER_03]: watching everybody come out of the
woodwork for sure it's uh it was lonely
[SPEAKER_03]: for a while in the 90s like i remember
times where it was like you'd change
[SPEAKER_03]: location and you'd spend months like
meeting new people and then figuring out
[SPEAKER_03]: like who you should ask about cannabis and
how you should ask and i mean there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: time before hey bro do you smoke and then
the reply of uh smoke what smoke what bro
[SPEAKER_03]: like that wasn't always a thing you used
to have to be like hey i noticed that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a jeep jerky with a fish sticker on
it yeah yeah i walked in with fucking long
[SPEAKER_03]: ass hair and a grateful dead shirt and
everyone's like hey bro can i buy drugs i
[SPEAKER_03]: want to go ski mary jane together after
class later like it used to be fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated yeah and now everybody's
coming out of the woodwork it's one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: things i really liked about being a
budtender is all walks of life coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: just having a blast um sharing a love of
cannabis like not one customer um after
[SPEAKER_03]: another would match up in any way shape or
form it's not like working in any other
[SPEAKER_03]: retail where it's you you're at the hot
clothing store so it's all like 18 19 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 21 years coming in or you sell hiking
shoes so it's all 35 and 45 year old guys
[SPEAKER_03]: that come in like when you're working in
the bud counter anyone of any age in any
[SPEAKER_03]: demographic can walk in like we'd have
people from different countries just
[SPEAKER_03]: regularly coming to check out what we're
anybody 21 and up yeah 21 and up but still
[SPEAKER_02]: but still that's just about every walk of
life is able to walk in there you got
[SPEAKER_02]: dudes that work in the industry
construction guys business guys doctors
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyers firemen uh law enforcement uh
accountants car sales men everybody was
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in there yep i mean you'll have a
200 000 car next to a vw bus in the
[SPEAKER_03]: parking lot and like it makes for a good
photo for facebook but other than that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just your regular work day you know
what i find is the guy that drives the
[SPEAKER_02]: volkswagen bus buys the more expensive
product than the guy that buy that drives
[SPEAKER_02]: the the uh the beamer or whatever the
other example was the mercedes yep they uh
[SPEAKER_03]: the the more you're into the cannabis
community and lifestyle the more you care
[SPEAKER_03]: about quality i think yes absolutely you
get a lot of people that are like it all
[SPEAKER_03]: smells the same to me and you just want to
smack them but like oh especially me being
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy that grew it and bred it like it
all smells the fucking same what um i get
[SPEAKER_03]: the same with like seafood i know people
that love seafood and there's big
[SPEAKER_03]: intricacies between like this particular
product and that particular product it all
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking smells like death to me i can't
get anywhere near it um and so like i get
[SPEAKER_03]: it some people just don't have the palette
to to distinguish cannabis varieties but
[SPEAKER_03]: man for those of us that can it's a
wonderful world and the more you get into
[SPEAKER_03]: the world the more you care about quality
the more you're willing to dig into it a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people like i don't care give me
the strongest yeah i went to a dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: a new place the other day that i'd never
shopped in before uh just because i went
[SPEAKER_02]: to weed maps and they said they had a
product i wanted and so i already knew
[SPEAKER_02]: what i was shopping for the minute i
walked in and i walked in and they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: hey welcome to this place have you ever
been here and i was like nope and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like let us give you a tour and i said
honestly i'm just here for this uh the
[SPEAKER_02]: green dot star dog the black label green
dot black label star dog concentrate and
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh well let me show you around and i
was like no i'm here for the green dot
[SPEAKER_02]: star label star dog black label and she's
like well here are the concentrates here's
[SPEAKER_02]: our clothing and i was like no i want and
i was like just get it yeah it took me so
[SPEAKER_02]: many tries just to convince this lady i
know what i want and then when she showed
[SPEAKER_02]: it to me she goes well this is and she
told me how much it was a little pricey i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if i should say how much stuff
costs on the air uh but she set a number
[SPEAKER_02]: and i was like well that is that's that's
not you know that's not cheap but i was
[SPEAKER_02]: like yeah i want that one and i want one
of these also and she's like those are
[SPEAKER_02]: this much and i was like yeah i want it
and she acted like oh okay and then is
[SPEAKER_03]: this a place on the south side of town
yeah i told you where i went yeah typical
[SPEAKER_03]: i mean my guess is that part of town they
get a clientele looking for a different
[SPEAKER_02]: price point right yeah and so they were
kind of shocked when i asked for that top
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf stuff but they wouldn't just walk me
i was like i want high-end concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: and she wouldn't just show me that and
then they do this weird thing um most
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries you say yeah i'll take that
thing right and then either that budtender
[SPEAKER_02]: walks it to the cash register and rings
you up for it and takes your money and
[SPEAKER_02]: tells you have a great day and high-fives
you right they go okay and they push some
[SPEAKER_02]: buttons on an ipad and she just kind of
walked away from me and i was like well no
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck and she came back she goes
oh they'll call your name when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: ready for you sweetie walk around and look
around and i was like well okay and so i
[SPEAKER_02]: just walk around for a couple of minutes
aimlessly because i don't really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see anything i've already purchased i've
already selected why do i want to go walk
[SPEAKER_02]: around now yeah i take money let me go
home give me somewhere comfortable to play
[SPEAKER_02]: with my phone at this point they took a
few minutes and then they called my full
[SPEAKER_02]: name over the counter over the pa which i
don't know if that was cool like isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: there should be some discretion here like
i don't just say it annoyed me as well
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah like people call me something
different here so i was like oh and i
[SPEAKER_02]: gotta walk over and be that name and so
then they uh they take your money at that
[SPEAKER_02]: they show you exactly what you bought one
star dog live resin and they put in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bag all smooth uh one was what else did i
buy i got a headband from somebody else
[SPEAKER_02]: that i've never tried it was pretty good
too another brand i'd never tried they got
[SPEAKER_02]: the headband and they put in there and
then they charged me my money and guy like
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to give me some speech about how
don't transfer this to anybody else and
[SPEAKER_02]: all this stuff and i was like yes sir i
took way too long but my point was i just
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to get in there and get that high
end concentrate man they wanted to give me
[SPEAKER_02]: a fucking tour i had to like break the
tour i was like no tour for me it was so
[SPEAKER_03]: frustrating just give me the concentrates
it's read your customer better yeah right
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's a person who wants the tour
there's a person who's who is excited to
[SPEAKER_03]: want to ride your store after they've
picked out what they want and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting to be charged for it oh they're a
recreational store but i still show them
[SPEAKER_02]: my medical marijuana card because a lot of
places will give you a discount and they
[SPEAKER_02]: did nice i went to a place today and they
had a long line and they're a medical and
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational facility and they actually
offered to let me skip the line because
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm a medical patient they're like do you
want it they go you can go first if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want because you're a med patient i was
like no no i'll wait in line i'm not i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not today i don't i'm not in a one no
there's some med patients where you
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of med patients where you
need to it's awesome they do that for
[SPEAKER_02]: right like yeah no i'm not too old yeah i
got i got body pain i'm not like right
[SPEAKER_02]: badly bad off or anything yeah i'm not
missing time like my family that i'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get back right now because i'm in
line right yeah and i've got three grams
[SPEAKER_02]: of deliciousness for a good price so i'm
glad i waited waited my turn and patiently
[SPEAKER_03]: got to check out the blood room it uh
there's a is the cannabis industry kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: expands and contracts people try different
sticks and like the ipad or the apple
[SPEAKER_03]: store model frustrates the fuck out of me
it feels weird like let me smell these
[SPEAKER_03]: three jars and i'll buy something i want
to roll like i it doesn't need to take all
[SPEAKER_03]: afternoon i've got other shit to do i've
got three more stops to make before i go
[SPEAKER_03]: home and when i get home there's gonna be
screaming kids like i don't have time for
[SPEAKER_02]: your speech that's why there are so many
though yeah and that leads me to something
[SPEAKER_02]: else that i should have been saying on the
podcast that i haven't ever said before
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys if you're going to a dispensary
and the quality is okay go to a different
[SPEAKER_02]: one next week and see if the quality is
awesome because there are dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: with better quality than where you're
shopping you don't have to go somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: just because it's the one on the way home
if you go to the dispensaries with the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality products the one the dispensary
without quality products will either
[SPEAKER_02]: disappear or they'll step up their game
and then we won't have this problem of all
[SPEAKER_02]: this mediocre fucking weed on the market
demand quality you talk with your money
[SPEAKER_03]: demand quality don't feel bad about saying
no thank you and leaving without a
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase either i people get to the and
decide they didn't want anything and as a
[SPEAKER_03]: bun tender i don't give a fuck yeah like
i'm sorry we don't have anything you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in both of us had our time
wasted haven't i stay yeah there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: reason for you to be like what's the
cheapest thing in the store yeah i need to
[SPEAKER_03]: spend eight bucks just because you spent
six minutes with me sell me this pack of
[SPEAKER_03]: papers i'll take a pack of papers yeah
like just no good like you're going to a
[SPEAKER_03]: different store they have papers too yep
go to another place go look around
[SPEAKER_02]: feelings there are a lot of different
vibes there are a lot of different uh
[SPEAKER_02]: processes the way that things are handled
if you like product selection yeah varies
[SPEAKER_02]: wildly so wildly pricing will be you'll
see the same products on the shelf for 20
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'll see for 45 on another place
but then they'll have the a rivaling
[SPEAKER_02]: product the prices will be switched like
viola is 20 at one place and csc is 40 at
[SPEAKER_02]: that place and then if i drive across town
the viola is 40 and the csc is 20 and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just fucking how they priced them for some
reason there's places in town that only
[SPEAKER_03]: carry one concentrate line and then the
concentrate line they carry you can't get
[SPEAKER_03]: in any other shop right there's a lot of
that and it takes kind of going around to
[SPEAKER_03]: all the different shops occasionally to
kind of figure out who's got what when i
[SPEAKER_02]: go to different stores on different days
of the week because there's a store down
[SPEAKER_02]: south that on tuesday does terpy tuesday
and these violas are on sale and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a store up north that does a sale
that i like and then there's another store
[SPEAKER_02]: right down the street from them that i try
to time up their two sales yeah just try
[SPEAKER_02]: to pay attention go to those sale days but
you guys like mike said you can leave a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary without buying anything this is
your medicine that you are buying for
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you're shopping for the day maybe
you're shopping for three days i usually
[SPEAKER_02]: shop for four or five days at a time when
i go in i want to get my medicine for the
[SPEAKER_02]: next three to five days so that i don't
have to drive back and wait in line and if
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm driving up to colorado springs that's
a 45 minute drive each direction plus i
[SPEAKER_02]: stop for food mike's been hostage in my
car for that uh 45 minute drive up there
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 or 30 minutes into the dispensary and
then another hour getting food plus a pee
[SPEAKER_02]: stop drive back 45 minute drive back and
then i want him to come hang out and take
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs after mike is a hostage for that
whole thing so if i can conflict nine
[SPEAKER_03]: hours yeah but it's a fucking awesome nine
hours if i can make that happen less
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently that saves us time and gas
money so yeah but my point is don't feel
[SPEAKER_02]: obligated to any dispensary if they're if
they're not it's it's like anything if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to the tire shop and the tire
shop has shit tires go to a different tire
[SPEAKER_02]: shop if you don't shop at k-mart for the
fucking tuxedo i mean if you want good
[SPEAKER_02]: quality go shop around look at different
dispensaries look at weed maps i know weed
[SPEAKER_02]: maps is a weird thing i they don't pay me
i use weed maps i know what i'm shopping
[SPEAKER_02]: for i can go to weed maps and look at the
dispensary and see what they've got and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you don't have to go in there and
look at all hundred jars and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: overwhelmed because that kind of sucks
sometimes be leery of the review section
[SPEAKER_03]: as well take it take your time to dig
through because a lot of the more
[SPEAKER_03]: reputable sites like weed maps and a few
of the others leaf leaf leaf buyer google
[SPEAKER_03]: they uh they let the business ding down
bad reviews from time to time but they
[SPEAKER_03]: won't let them take them all down
especially the really legit like spelled
[SPEAKER_03]: out bad reviews where the the customer is
specific with their complaints and um not
[SPEAKER_03]: abusive in their language those all end up
staying up and if you scroll down a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit you'll get past all the two dollars
off your pre-roll for a five star review
[SPEAKER_03]: reviews and get to the the real meat of
the store and that's the stuff you're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for especially when it comes to
like selection pricing service right um
[SPEAKER_03]: and then their menus are their menus
updated um a lot of places their menus
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't been updated in two months and you
go in and you're like oh man i saw they
[SPEAKER_03]: had the fire on the website you go in
there like yeah we've been sold out for
[SPEAKER_02]: four months let me show you not fire
complain about that honestly a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries if you go in there and you
say hey i see the golden goat uh can i get
[SPEAKER_02]: an eight the golden goat they're gonna go
we don't have golden goat you pull up that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking weed maps page and go look at
shows right here that you got golden goat
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll give you a deal they'll do
something for it because that is their
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility to keep that shit updated
i've driven to a dispensary because they
[SPEAKER_02]: said they've had something they didn't
they felt really bad they were like hey
[SPEAKER_02]: that girl that was supposed to be updating
it was actually there she kind of got in
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble i felt bad but they gave me a fat
deal so it's uh that's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: every shop should be on top of don't feel
bad about shopping for quality leaving
[SPEAKER_03]: without a purchase or or digging them for
inaccurate menus like this is just
[SPEAKER_02]: standard shit before i've talked about not
tipping bud tenders because i feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: they uh i don't know sometimes it totally
depends on the interaction right yeah i
[SPEAKER_03]: always agree with that part of it i'm
buying concentrates today i knew what i
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted i was like i want three of these
things and the basically the bud tender
[SPEAKER_02]: had to put three packs in a jar or in a
baggie and hand them to me and take my
[SPEAKER_03]: money right and i did tip today at that
point you're tipping for them counting
[SPEAKER_02]: your change back correctly right and she
was smart enough to give me my change in
[SPEAKER_02]: ones which is part of why she got a tip
she wasn't going to get all five of it but
[SPEAKER_02]: since she gave it back in one she got
three of them uh because she was smart
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to break it down into some ones
which is that was the only determining
[SPEAKER_02]: factor is like if she gives me once she's
going to get a few of them if she does not
[SPEAKER_02]: she don't get five right her that's that
wasn't worth five it was worth three and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were super friendly they're super
nice but i tipped i would i probably would
[SPEAKER_02]: have tipped too but the guy that was in
front of me was uh not pleasant and i felt
[SPEAKER_02]: bad for the bud tenders i was like damn
that guy kind of just fucked your day up
[SPEAKER_02]: so here's maybe this will fix it you know
that's part of why i tipped today and i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not against tipping a bud tender i just uh
then i'm i'm all about it but before i
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't do it as frequently and you would
have to do something to i don't know i
[SPEAKER_03]: almost always tip something but some
people definitely get the loose change and
[SPEAKER_03]: other people will get a five like it just
it completely depends on your interaction
[SPEAKER_03]: if i walk in and go give me two of those
and you just sort of nod at me and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: done like if i walk in and you know and
you're like oh like this is in your
[SPEAKER_03]: wheelhouse this came in just so you know
and you might be getting a nice tip yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: uh actually she had to go get those out of
the back today so she had to go for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little walk carry some stuff so i guess it
was worth me helping her out but yeah the
[SPEAKER_02]: guy before me bro was not pleasant he was
in a bad bad mood today yep i've been
[SPEAKER_03]: there both ways yeah on both sides of that
counter yep yeah i've been both customers
[SPEAKER_03]: too there's been some bad days out there
they happen that's why we have these
[SPEAKER_03]: delicious concentrates i want to take a
dab after all this dab talk i've got i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the rig and i'm looking at some
hash well i'm gonna get some of this uh
[SPEAKER_02]: clementine cookies going we'll take a dab
and then we'll start uh i'll just start
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapping up the show right now mike thanks
for bringing your uh your uh little
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap-up part to the show thanks for having
more stuff to talk about on the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always great to have your view your
opinion your voice on the podcast and then
[SPEAKER_02]: he went blank because he's checking his
phone to see if he's got more content that
[SPEAKER_03]: he can talk about um i went to check
twitter real quick to see if there was
[SPEAKER_03]: another story right in front of me that uh
i'm spacing out on um the one i can think
[SPEAKER_03]: of is right now especially if you're in
colorado there's uh what they call uh an
[SPEAKER_03]: on site consumption bill sitting on our
governor's desk miracle of miracles our
[SPEAKER_03]: state legislature kicked it up i'm not
sure the deadline for his signature has
[SPEAKER_03]: passed i know there is one you just
grabbed a sheet of paper do you have the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer i'm not i don't know i don't have
the deadline written down as far as i know
[SPEAKER_02]: that it has passed the step before it is
on his desk it's just sitting there
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for governor to sign it it's
tasting bill uh it's uh senate bill twelve
[SPEAKER_02]: fifty eight one two five eight and what
you can do is go to you guys get a pin or
[SPEAKER_02]: type this into your web browser right now
it is www.colorado.gov slash governor
[SPEAKER_02]: slash share dash your dash comments it's
colorado.gov slash governor slash share
[SPEAKER_02]: your comments with dashes share dash your
comments go there it's really easy any
[SPEAKER_02]: pothead can do it i did it it's super
simple uh there are a few questions the
[SPEAKER_02]: question to answer number one yes okay i'm
already answering the shit for you making
[SPEAKER_02]: it easy the question to answer to question
number two bill number one two five eight
[SPEAKER_02]: all right then it's going to ask you are
you opposed or for you are for it all
[SPEAKER_02]: right then it's going to ask you to
explain say please allow this tasting bill
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something we need here in colorado
um basically this uh if you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar it allows existing cannabis legal
cannabis businesses so licensed
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries to allow on-site consumption
of non-combustible cannabis product um so
[SPEAKER_03]: they can set up a little area where they
could perfectly legally set up a dab bar
[SPEAKER_03]: or an edible sampling room where you can
go in and while you're you're shopping you
[SPEAKER_03]: know bring yourself a driver just so you
can enjoy yourself to the fullest and go
[SPEAKER_03]: in if you've you know been looking at an
edible you haven't you know pwned up and
[SPEAKER_03]: tried yet but always just kind of notice
while you're in their home what does the
[SPEAKER_03]: peanut butter boot it tastes like or uh
fucking banana what i need to try that
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah and you'll have a chance to just go
in and get a smaller portion of it get a
[SPEAKER_03]: sample of it and try it take a dab of an
extract maybe you're not familiar with or
[SPEAKER_03]: a company you're not familiar with there's
a couple of different options that we'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to do that we would not at all allow
to do right now um if this bill gets
[SPEAKER_03]: signed it's going to take a while to get
implemented it's going to take a while to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what best practices are and and
see exactly how it plays out but this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: big step forward for colorado if it gets
signed this would be really great right
[SPEAKER_02]: now uh brands do a thing called pop-ups so
say mike and i have let's say we've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary right mike and jeff's fucking
weed weed hut weed hut yeah ganja emporium
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever weed tin check we say hey on
friday uh the grow from your heart podcast

[SPEAKER_03]: drop this is our new drop there there's a
couple of things i want to get up or bring
[SPEAKER_03]: up before we get through with this story
the first is if this passes miracle and
[SPEAKER_03]: miracles and this gets into practice
please don't fuck it up for the rest of us
[SPEAKER_03]: consume with uh not a clear head but like
know what you're getting into don't go
[SPEAKER_03]: don't overdo it make an ass yourself in
front of everybody have an exit plan what
[SPEAKER_03]: are you gonna do after this dab you gotta
get home somehow are you on your lunch
[SPEAKER_03]: break is this your first dab pick it
through and uh the second point is the the
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-pot community around the country such
as it is is pretty shitty at most of what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're trying to do but one of the things
they're pretty good at is inundating a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific person in government with a lot
of emails about a specific issue um and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is one they've hit a couple of times
and i'm not surprised it sat on the
[SPEAKER_03]: governor's desk as long as it has
considering the amount of anti-pot uh
[SPEAKER_03]: contact to government governor tell them
not to allow this it'll lead to dead
[SPEAKER_03]: people on the roads that are that type
posts i've seen so uh get active get
[SPEAKER_03]: informed contact your governor if you're
in colorado right now to contact
[SPEAKER_03]: Hickenlooper would be very very helpful to
the community um i know a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: who have been dying to set up some sort of
consumption area room lounge whatever and
[SPEAKER_03]: fully be legal they don't want to do it in
the gray market or as a church or a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of the other things they've got going on
right now they want to be able to do it as
[SPEAKER_03]: part of their legal cannabis business and
this is a big a big window of opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: to do just that and uh if we can we should
take it please please do the vein on
[SPEAKER_03]: jeff's forehead just raised like a quarter
inch with that dab i just took a gigantic
[SPEAKER_02]: dab might have been too big for the
podcast but i'm gonna live it feels like
