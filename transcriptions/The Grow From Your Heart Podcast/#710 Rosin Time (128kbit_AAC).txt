[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include that link in
the show notes and the video description
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it super easy for all of my stoned
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got through that intro super
quickly, right after a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited to get started here on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some wonderful concentrate
makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start off by introducing my friend,
Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very, very much for considering
me on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post it to Discord that I wanted to have
concentrate makers on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pedro and Ryan just were the top two
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was like, get Pedro,
get Ryan, get Pedro, get Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more than obvious that this was the
show that had to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to have you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, brother, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go too far, Pedro, would you
like to do some plugs and let everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: know how they can stalk you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do know you have a lot of
avenues for people to find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess first and foremost, the main
Instagram account is MrRosin's dot
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a play there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But MrRosin's neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the passion Rosin pressing that I
do takes place over on Rosin dot is dot
[SPEAKER_01]: legal dot fuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rosin is legal fuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little kick for Instagram when
they shut my first account down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my glass sales and everything is
over on TheHeddyVault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bunch of glass sales over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Pedro'sgrowroom.com,
www.Pedrosgrowroom.com for glass sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: for discounts, for education, for
information to contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a Discord as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just contact me through those avenues
and we'll get you hooked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably about the best
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hopefully that Instagram is still up
by the time this episode airs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting people rather than jinxing
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the jinxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's wood around here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've knocked on some good wood,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of stuff to plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also find him on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you do some Twitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Twitcher too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitch.tv forward slash Pedro'sgrowroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Wednesday night, man, we're on a
streak with 240 some weeks in every
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of a little stoner session at
about nine thirty on Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're down, come get high with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smokes great concentrates through
beautiful glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow him on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on and introduce the legend,
Mr. Rosin Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have as many plugs as Pedro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can pretty much for the most
part catch me on our army discord,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hang out there quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a hell of a crew, a community
over there that we're building.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that everybody kind of pushed me
to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad they pushed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it didn't take too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go too far into it, let's briefly
talk about what 710 is and means so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people understand why we're doing a hash
episode on 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll delve deeply into making
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to focus on in this episode is
I want to get the audience, the listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: basically self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be able to grow from seed
or clone, however they're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: manage their grow all the way up to
getting that dab onto the nail and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: a fat hit of their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro got excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about to take that fat rip right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's briefly talk about what 710 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people might not even know why we
are celebrating 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 710th episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give them a quick update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Pedro has taken a dab, Ryan,
do you have any input on what 710 means?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you talk for a minute because I
feel like I talk a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, 710 to me is kind of a newer thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, you know, it's oiled
backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for us dabbers these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I would have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's upgraded 420, 420 for big kids.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upgrade your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically that is what I would have
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I concur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I concur.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all agreeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn the word oil upside down,
it does say 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that clock strikes 710,
we used to smoke a bowl at 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still smoke a bowl at 420, but now also
I'm taking a dab at 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today- It's just another excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like we needed an excuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, we actually did
take one on 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we actually were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life force itself out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 710 is dab time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the 710th episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to teach everybody how to make
their own dabs at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: No solvent-less stuff here because I don't
want to encourage anybody or teach them
[SPEAKER_00]: how to hurt themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shit that can go wrong in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense, no hatred.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing that, do your thing,
but stay safe and don't call me when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get blown up by your own mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to step in there if I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear it, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you said something that I hear a
lot of people say, and it's like sticking
[SPEAKER_01]: something underneath my skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little mosquito buzzing around
your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you how to make dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show you how to make dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dab is like, it's a verb, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a noun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to show you how to make hash
and how to make rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll jump into it now that we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good part to just jump off on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with kind of like,
I'm hoping that a lot of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: watching are growing their own product as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to get the product to wash,
to press from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about, are there any
significant differences in the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were going to grow for flower,
when I grow, I grow for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grow is way different than most
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are growing for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are growing for concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a big difference in the way you
treat the grow other than most people?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say minimally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say minimally as far as technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I can come up with would be
scrogging excessively so that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get main big colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a very consistent bud size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big scrog is something that I really,
really strive for.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants grow horizontally, not
vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what most people should be
doing now anyway, no matter how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the ideal way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to maximize your space,
really, especially for us home growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a scrogger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a four by four scroggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's step back for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we explain just as an overview what
hash and rousin are and what we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve and why we're doing what we're
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to explain it in a broad sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like hash for dummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichomes are the plant's defense
mechanism for UV light and for bugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: pests and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of them as millions and billions
and billions of little beach balls on your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those beach balls are on top of a
stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't need to get into technical
terms because that's just advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got billions of beach balls on
top of a stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are after from a hash standpoint
is those beach balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those little beach balls,
they're a little waxy cuticle filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, hopefully filled with oil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that oil inside that waxy cuticle is
what us rousin heads are after.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leave the waxy cuticle behind in the
hash and we extract the oil, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: where the 710, the oil comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's spots you can stop along the
way, but that is kind of ultimately what
[SPEAKER_01]: we are going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that we're going to be
talking about subsequently eases our
[SPEAKER_01]: access to those trichome heads.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a perfect explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even need notes after you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have anything to say after
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case dismissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump back to a conversation
that I interrupted before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do trichome head sizes make a big
difference in trichome shape?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're after those big trichome heads and
we want that weak neck that we can kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: break off and get those beach balls,
as Patriot just explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the size, size, not so much,
but the shape, you know, if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: heads that are stuck together,
two, three, four heads, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have a stock with two,
three, four heads stuck together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to collect in different bags
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So uniformity is also desirable as well in
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being noted, as I said in a couple of
seconds ago, the trichome are the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: protection against UV light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, if you're not giving them UV
light, they have nothing to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: protection against.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of sungrown cannabis has big,
juicy, bulbous trichome heads because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the extra UV light from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not, I did not, did not know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're teaching me stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan, I feel like- And keep that in mind
when you're making your LED selections as
[SPEAKER_03]: well for your lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you're going to make
concentrates, let's upgrade and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those LEDs with UV lights in there and
that may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger trichomes, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strain selection, that was one of
the things that you mentioned that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all about, a lot about strain selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, Dr. Dre taught us that we
want a sack of rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the dispensary, all the buds
are super dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already, I think you know where I'm
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the bud density really make a
difference for you concentrate makers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those fluffier buds going to be more
ideal for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot easier to wash, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually just talking to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading through Discord and somebody
was giving someone a suggestion upon
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, if you don't give them enough
light, you're going to have airy buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, they were like,
oh, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want airy buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'd much rather have a bud that the
first wash just falls apart rather than go
[SPEAKER_01]: in on the third wash and see dense nuggets
that I still haven't broken into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always explained it as if I took my
fist and moistened my fist and dunked it
[SPEAKER_00]: in powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my fist worth of trichomes on the
outside here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I open up my hand and do the same
process, I get my palm, all the insides of
[SPEAKER_00]: my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that much more space for trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, like you said, easier to wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to wash inside of my fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fingers open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wash that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really I thought that would be a thing
of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of what I breed isn't super tight and
super dense, but I know that it you press
[SPEAKER_00]: some strawberry starburst and Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was some of the best rosin I've
ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Rosin, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend, Kelvin,
who grew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you press that at the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, man, that was a hell of a frickin
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a good time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss those events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these times come back, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Times come back soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about making
concentrate, making concentrates out of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes from plants that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my main questions was, do we treat
them any differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like we just grow them like
normal trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to scrog them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we manage pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are putting pesticides on
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke pesticides,
especially pesticide concentrates in my
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys manage pests in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, who's spraying pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing gets sprayed in my flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: No nothing in my flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just sacrilegious about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have pests in my flower room,
we start over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's dedication.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty much the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: No sprays or anything like that in my
flower room if I do have any issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's generally thrips up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get thrips quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually do green lacewing larvae.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple, cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: One round usually takes care pretty much
right through flower, and that does it,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I'm a big Dr. Zymes
person pretty much through veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Zymes and green cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entomatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will agree with the beneficial bugs
greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally try to stick them in veg,
but of course they carry over into the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I concur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that that would be the answer
was the beneficial predators there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you said lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been some of my favorite in a
commercial grow, especially in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they tolerate all types of
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't die off as quickly as your
Swarovskis and Hypoaspis, and they stick
[SPEAKER_00]: around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those larvae are hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those little crocodiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cool as hell looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like dinosaur crocodiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever been bitten by one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bite you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bite the shit out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's what was biting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bite the shit out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked a lot about the grow
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get the even sized buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want bigger trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the process of actually
making the concentrates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the first thing about making
any sort of rosettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we are right to the day of
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do if we're going to make
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of us are going to freeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us are going to press it right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the differences that we're going
to run into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you teach me how to harvest for
concentrate production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the first thing that comes to mind
is cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold, cold, cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it comes down to, yeah,
are we doing fresh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing a half dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing a full dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I'm concerned, that's kind of
the three things that we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll let Roslyn take the fresh because
he says he likes fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go live, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the fresh stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much most of my top buds and stuff,
for the most part, I pretty much generally
[SPEAKER_03]: keep her smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally do it all for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all my barf, anything that doesn't have
any kind of bag appeal pretty much goes
[SPEAKER_03]: right to my hash bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fresh freeze it that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I pretty much try to process it
as soon as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I tend to store it, I do vacuum seal it
and keep it frozen that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The longer the storage, obviously the
worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpene preservation is everything,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: So other than that, like Pedro said,
cold, cold, cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a strong believer in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my water super, super cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the wash unless it's winter
time generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, garage is a perfect place for
that this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the words washing weather on my
notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful washing weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't touch anything all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you don't even mess with it in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't personally know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's like the temperature threshold when
you start going, oh, it's washing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: What gets you excited?
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as I see that snow fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro's got a big silly grin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll just let him go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking about where I can fill
in here and where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowboard kids in the hash washers get
excited at that first snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a cold room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built myself a cold room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can make it 32 degrees in my room
when it's 100 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always wash in 33 degree weather if
I can, especially with fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: My God, especially with fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the nuances that doesn't get
talked about enough is people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fresh frozen, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever touched a fucking plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever seen how sticky a plant is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now collect all those sticky balls,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we do it in the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cold takes away a lot of the immediate
stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also brittles the trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing fresh frozen,
that's immensely more important to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: cold and to have them break off and to
remain cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, if you have fresh frozen hash
that gets above goodness, sometimes 50
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees, it's already starting to congeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already starting to melt together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already starting to lose its beach
sand consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fresh frozen is not a beginner game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh frozen is an advanced player game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold, cold, cold is immensely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything, again, anything above 40 degrees
and you're starting to get problematic
[SPEAKER_01]: with your bag, your collection bags,
stuff sticking to them, trichomes sticking
[SPEAKER_01]: to spoons, just being a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need to keep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, I even like to
keep a bucket of cold water right next to
[SPEAKER_03]: me as I'm washing so I can put my bags
right in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my bags go in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My spoon goes into a little cup with ice
water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like when I say cold, I hope I'm not
being underestimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 degrees that if you're not if you're
from the coast, one of the coast 30
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees doesn't make sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 30 go in the walk in cooler wherever
if you work at a restaurant, go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colder than that at 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's probably not 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, walk in and you're starting water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand in your walk in cooler for eight
hours and tell me how you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was gonna ask if you can get dizzy
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not physically get dizzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your wife's name is dizzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get dizzy to even walk in that
walk in cooler?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she'll walk in and bring me lunch or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep my I can't keep my dad Briggs
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't add her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't dab in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do you can't get frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's what I was gonna mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you keep your your water ice cold too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like do you keep like I use distilled
water and I always keep it in a beer
[SPEAKER_03]: fridge before I generally use that keep it
right at that 33 degree mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 344 gallons in drums as my Rez's in
my room underneath my cabinets and those
[SPEAKER_01]: get ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I go when I go when I wash,
I'll bet I'll go through a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though my room is that cold,
even though my room is there, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: is ice cold period.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're using at least 25 pounds usually
per five gallon wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then and four gallons of distilled
cold, cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't use distilled for the wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will use R.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: for my final rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that the higher quality water
that you're going to use in minimal
[SPEAKER_01]: increments are going to be higher quality
concentrates for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, we use well water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't want that trace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That taste to kind of transfer through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mineral flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back real quick, though,
to the to the fresh and then half and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the other dry because I think I covered it
real good with the fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you can't achieve 32 degrees,
you know, you got outside, it's got 40 is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best I can do, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend a half dry like it's
one of my go tos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've kind of underlined that
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and I say half dry anymore because
people want to fucking tie you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and a half days, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's you know,
it's that half dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that when the outside of the bud just
starts to get crunchy, but the inner side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bud is still is still hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's about when I'll hang my
flowers, you know, 50, 50, 60,
[SPEAKER_01]: 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I brush over that 50 degrees,
50 humidity, 60 degrees, 60 humidity in
[SPEAKER_01]: that window, dry for the half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're eight days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're whatever your half dry is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then buck that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing that I think we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't underline it when in techniques
is again, millions of little tricone
[SPEAKER_01]: heads, millions of little balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filled with oil.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't don't molest it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people want to use trimmers and
they want to bounce their shit and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to know is as easy and as careful as
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each tricone head is another little bit of
oil that you're trying to that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then there's the then there's
a full dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we progress through the from the
fresh to the half to the full dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tricone heads get more brittle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get less sticky, less terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a little bit easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I said less terpene content,
not to the point of degradation
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily, but to the ease of handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's definitely some
tricks, you know, when you're when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: there half dry, you can probably wash in
40 degree weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're full dry, you can maybe wash
in 50 degree weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: That brings me to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a wet tremor or dry tremor?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I harvest, I'll take off
everything with with without trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything without trikes goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it brings me another thing to fill in
one of your blanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you keep flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of plants that I grow,
mimosa specifically, and a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: very few ones that will actually keep her
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't personally smoke flour,
hardly at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dizzy smokes a lot more flour than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just I'm a straight hash head.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're 50 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we keep a good flour and a good hash in
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hash just hit me in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot where I was going with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab and stumbled over my
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't save any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What doesn't have trichomes comes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't save any of it for flour
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then it just gets bucked
straight into a bag, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from from fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's fresh, it gets bucked straight
into a bag straight into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's half dry, it gets dried halfway
buck straight into a bag into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's dried, it gets dried fully bucked
into a bag put into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to understand why I see the
rosins twice the price of other
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, now that I see that you're
getting you said like a few pounds of herb
[SPEAKER_00]: gave you a very tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's all you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I kind of I understand there's a
lot of work to go into it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a lot lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me that that number is astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I what he's referring to is earlier
in a podcast, I said that my critical Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: on average gives me if I push the limits
gives me two and a half ounces of rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: per pound of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about the the market
prices on the on the recreational market
[SPEAKER_01]: price right now a flowers in the wholesale
prices for flowers in the $300 range,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so wholesale pricing for rosin
is in the 15 to $30 a gram range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do the math and you can see it
quickly adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see good rosin on shelves for $80 120 a
gram for the top shelf shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that's what it sells for out here to
Massachusetts and surrounding states are
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 to $100 a gram for good rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was I was referring to the wholesale
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the purchase price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come here thinking you're going to
get it for the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is that's wholesale on the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said that because I'm
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't I didn't mention that in the
intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I don't we're still in kind of
the infancy phases and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm busting my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting in crazy hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are entering the recreational and
med market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We as in Pedro, I guess I say we and it's
like looking who the fuck's behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a grow, grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a grow up in parachute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Eden extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Eden's supernatural gardening,
supernatural gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're moving into, you know,
people have been asking me for years if
[SPEAKER_01]: they can purchase my rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is resoundingly no,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But soon to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be able to purchase rosin that
I've actually made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world will look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit the rec market with that Pedro Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can come talk about what I've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that changed my opinion on
Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's crazy to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's crazy for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say he's going to have to
send me a little bit so I can sample that
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll all meet at the Denver
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the sake of recording purposes,
you know, so we were in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the half dry process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to I don't even remember where we
got to, because I'm not a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you were done with that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you remember either.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was pretty much done with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's literally just differences in
climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not literally just, but it's
differences in climates that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of underline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to underline the point that
people are just starting to do this should
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely not start with fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just an underline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with start with dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get crazy and think you're
somebody, then go ahead and do the half
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pay attention to what I just said,
or the not the half frozen half dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pay attention to what I just said,
I would highly recommend anybody that's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to wash their first wash washes
dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: How dry like cured or just dry,
just dry, just dry, just dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I always when I'm processing for
rosin, it's either fresh bag freezer,
[SPEAKER_01]: half dry bag freezer or dry bag freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean dry and cure bag
freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry then freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that freezing process, from what I
understand, that's like, and this is scary
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, just because I'm a guy with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of thinks of if you get gum in
your hair or something, you used to freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: the gum and it would come out of your
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same idea I get when you
talk about breaking those trichome heads
[SPEAKER_00]: off in the freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why we which is why we underline
being careful with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take it out of the freezer,
I'll throw the shit over my shoulder and
[SPEAKER_01]: walk into the you know, it's very delicate
process because I want to collect those
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought a weed Santa definitely saw weed
Santa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're trimming, when you're
handling it, when you're everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when when I bring someone into
my grow to, to harvest or to to help me
[SPEAKER_01]: with the process of pre you know,
basically harvest, if I see a lot of Roz a
[SPEAKER_01]: resin all over your gloves and shit,
we're gonna have a little bit of a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, little Why is he doing to those
buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, stop molesting my shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a gram on your fingers right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if soup is one, go ahead, Ryan,
I don't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say that's what I feel like
wet trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, there's you got a little bit
less handling and those trichomes are a
[SPEAKER_03]: little less brittle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when they're wet, too,
I feel like those everything's more intact
[SPEAKER_03]: and just better overall if you're doing a
wet trim, if you're gonna watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, trimming is only a flower thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to if I'm going to rosin,
there's trim doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hardest flower and rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mean is just you don't but you
probably don't trim your lowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just throw that into the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so for your rosin, you're not trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my lowers larv anything that has zero
bag appeal, dude, right to the hash bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally my entire heart my every bit of
my harvest go right into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that freeze dryer to brother or
that cold room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was gonna be my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, Ryan just segue for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to keep the stuff cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is freeze drying this but an option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that's useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got excited about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that has been talked about
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Controversial as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think yes, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that for smoking flower,
freeze drying your buds is not applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're locking a lot of stuff in in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just removing moisture,
but you're locking a lot of stuff in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that you would that would otherwise
off gas and and dry and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was the one big thing I was
thinking about chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like green bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if we're not smoking the
flower, we're just collecting the trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a viable option?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get very dry dense or not dry dense
very dry brittle buds and trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's viable, but God damn think about
the price, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 36 hours for a freeze dry session and
you can probably put a half a pound in a
[SPEAKER_01]: big freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you guys want to spend $300 a gram?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I may.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no viable, but possible with the with
the tools and freeze dryers and stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for freeze drying flower now freeze
drying the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I'm concerned, that's like the
big step up in in in absolutely definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's another thing we could
talk about is how you actually dry and
[SPEAKER_03]: process afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: After we wash for me, I'm a home grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze dryers are expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's a tough thing for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, that was a big step to learn as
well just to preserve those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, like I don't even press it
right out of the bag pretty much on the
[SPEAKER_03]: pressing screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep it in a ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fresh freeze it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a microplane to crap out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the only way I really can do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just flash freeze it, microplane it,
make it that sandy material pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: scattered across a piece of parchment
paper and dry it as fast as you possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: can in that 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at a cooler temperature pizza box tech
pizza box tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just I just I microplane it,
put it on a big piece of parchment paper,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I just set it on a counter in a garage
at 4050 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty much dry by the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very low relative immunity here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sure, it's pretty much ready to rock by
the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people also use the put that
parchment inside pizza boxes, the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cardboard cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it pulls more moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microplaning is when you turn it into
dust, basically, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the little file and turn it to
sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so he's like a lemon zester.
[SPEAKER_01]: He breezed over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a much more arduous task than he
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see, you have a big frozen ball of
stickiness, OK, that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: microplane before it gets too sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to cold, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how many how many times you put that
freezer or that thing back in the freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're microplaning?
[SPEAKER_03]: By four or five times at least exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many minutes between those times all
depends?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably an hour to microplane it just
because I have to keep refreezing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that and and with the air drying you
got you have oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're losing terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the whole nine yards color color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah, degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that freeze dryer man, two grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tough buy, but one of the best
I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get you can get by with a small
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get by with a small one,
so don't don't feel like you need a big,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, expensive ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get by with small one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll change your game like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's on top of the list,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next three Christmases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gotten through the frozen the
half dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time to kind of explain the
process of harvesting in terms of turning
[SPEAKER_00]: our dry product into a smokable
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, into a smokable rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to use the right words now that
I've been educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold cold water where you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fun part where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If some people will say, oh, water is a
universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we solvent list, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A solvent is only a solvent when it's used
to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say we're using it mechanically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not using the water to dissolve our
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it as a carrier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it just just literally as a
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we're solvent lists and we're using
that cold that the brittleness properties
[SPEAKER_01]: of that trichome head hopefully at least
we discussed a little bit in the pre show
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding a stocked trichome head and a
bulbous trichome head where it's literally
[SPEAKER_01]: just a bulb of a trichome head on the leaf
itself where there is no stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that doesn't wash well at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely need stocked trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to give you your
better yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally dump your flower into water,
agitate it and collect the water in in in
[SPEAKER_01]: the agitated in the simplest form,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can get into ice content in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into the temperature of the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into agitation practices,
whether it's mechanical or hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into time vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into collecting techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for this for the simplest dumbed down
explanation, it's in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's agitated cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we collect the trichome heads that
have collected in the water at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those trichome heads will be in the
different size bags with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: micron screens in the bottom of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan said don't over agitate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made bubble hash before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taught by the legendary sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used his bubble bag method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subbie taught us to agitate the shit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subbie the shit out of his father's
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of guys used to use paint
mixers on drills.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me cringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it once and I was like, what is
going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that when I looked at my bag and
everything was green.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get into this, it's definitely
a look, a feel, a touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely doing it multiple times,
watching that water, watching what's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same time every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same time with every female.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different for every strain,
every female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a look, a feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you got to know just
by doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand the process of the
sieve bags, the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that bubble hash back in the day
because we use bubble bags to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bubbles when you make it or when you
burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It melts when you light it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do if I want to turn that into
rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part where I am lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do to turn my bag wash into
rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we press this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how to do that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after I get my hash out of the water,
the best consistency I can say is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pancake type consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when my hash comes out of the bags,
let's step back a little bit more and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about those collection bags.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, bubble bags, bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an interview with bubble man himself
and the first bags that I purchased some
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years ago were hand stitched by his
wife, which is just freaking cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was hand stitching them in her living
room at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this varies with manufacture,
but for the most part, there's a 25,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a 45, there's a 73, there's a 90,
there's a 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a 160, there's a 190, there's a
220.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the general, and they'll be
off on a couple of micron sizes on
[SPEAKER_01]: different manufacturers, but that's about
round ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a whole, most people and most phenos
will collect somewhere in the 45 to 159
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it might be 73 to 159.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be 90 to 159.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be 90 to 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially what the micron size is,
is it's a whole size in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will let through anything smaller than
73 microns, than 93 microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will hold everything bigger than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use all eight bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use four bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use really whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taught a lot of people in the past to
use the 25, the 45, the 160 and the 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can collect your 45 through 159 and
have a beautiful, I call it broad
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never call it full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full spectrum of smoking flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a very broad spectrum
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you pull it down into the 90
to 120, you've got a way more isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_03]: My 73 and my 120 are my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, usually they spot the right for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the 90 and 120 sell the best at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start isolating heads in a 90
bag, like let's say you're using all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the eight bags, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to isolate the 90 to 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're no longer getting that two and a
half ounces per pound of the 90 to 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: That two and a half ounces is all of your
rosin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if you start taking just this
little bit, now you've got what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight ounces or eight grams or whatever
the numbers is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the shit's costing you $150
a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to burst this?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we don't sell it and we don't
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to burst the bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the 90, the 120, the 73,
the isolated bags is hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because everybody started this
smoking flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's getting every cannabinoid that the
plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want to say every
cannabinoid, but that's getting the vast
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the cannabinoid that the plant
has to offer in your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start isolating things and not
even burning plant material, you've lost
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just went down to broad at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time you take a step into a
smaller size, 90 to 120, a smaller bag
[SPEAKER_01]: size, a smaller pole, you've isolated
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're no longer getting a broad,
you're no longer getting that full high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might only get a heady high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be different for every
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to do the 45 to 159.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe there's value in pulling the
45 out and going to like the 73 to 120 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 73 to 159.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe there's some subtle nuances
and benefits to doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the more that we isolate the
heads and we isolate the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're stepping away from that full body
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that some concentrates
definitely make me super droopy eyed and
[SPEAKER_00]: super lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some will definitely give me bug
eyed and moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that there's not the full
experience that you get from some other
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery methods for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people like want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great thing to know and to
desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got so we've done our press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to where we've done our
wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we press this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we're no, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all stoned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get us back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ramble all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I can listen to them all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut you off the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've isolated our bags, whatever bags
we have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got hash that we're ready to press,
whether it's your 73, whether it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: 90, whether it's your broad spectrum,
whatever we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say we've got beach beach
sand quality hash sitting in front of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's been microplained and it's
the sand particles are a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all got beach sand in front of us,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, everything I use is rosin
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, it's a plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them all day long every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use the two or the two by four and a
half inch bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a two by four and a half inch bag,
I will put 20 grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in a 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, there's a whole nother story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bags have micron sizes, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rosin filter bags have micron sizes,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you double your bags as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I triple them actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I double mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do 37 micron doubles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do 225s in a 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually I just ordered and have
them sitting over here right next to me 15
[SPEAKER_01]: microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to play around with some 15
microns as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm figuring if it's oil, why do we want a
micron size anyways?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take out the lipids for the most part,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're getting down to 15 microns
instead of 25, we're potentially removing
[SPEAKER_01]: it more undesirably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, there's different
micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when we used to press flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christ, we used to press flour in a 90
micron or a 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those days are funny to think back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll take 20 grams and we'll put it
in a 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll slip that in another 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double filtration, double blowout
prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will always put that in a 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 160 is extra blowout protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no filtration with the 160
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that it does that people don't
give enough credit to is bag slippage.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put your your bags into a 160 and
put them onto parchment, they won't slip
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that, anybody that's
ever pressed hash has had a blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your bag is not centered on your plates
or at least within the square inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: your plates, if any part of that bag comes
out of that press area, you will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of your hash will go to that little
spot and it will literally, you will have
[SPEAKER_01]: hash shoot at your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't be the same color as the rest of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do it in the 225s, that's double
blowout prevention, double filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 160 is blowout prevention,
but also slippage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bag stays put.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, that's just, I've been doing it
that way religiously for a couple of years
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good tip, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then time, temperature, pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I just wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time, tip, time and weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're, again, depends, depends,
depends, depends, depends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we're, this is why we are
who we are, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strain dependent again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere between the, some people get
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people go down to 150, 160s,
160s, you know, some people are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 160s.
[SPEAKER_03]: 170, 180 for hash for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: 180, almost, almost religiously 180,
170, 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if the hash is looking weird,
I'll bump to 190 just to see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: hell's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just, man, I see people pressing at
two, 210, 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, whoa, bro, do you see the
bubbles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you understand what bubbling,
rosin means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we're talking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bubbling should happen after I paid
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubbling is literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it should be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're bubbling on the press,
you're degrading your rosin horribly,
[SPEAKER_01]: horribly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pressing above 190, you're
degrading.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you get that burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my notes is how to avoid the burnt
popcorn flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go above 190.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go above 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to stay below the 180, 190 mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then temperature or time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want the very specific this
is one of the things that I've done since
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of underlined who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to the rosin.is.legal.fuckers
account, I tell you all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've pressed at 82 degrees Celsius for two
and a half minutes at this amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure at the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, bag pressure is another thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that and it's just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And slow pressure when you're pressing
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that, get that slow pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fricking squeeze the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna blow those bags out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're doubling, tripling them
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And same thing with flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about flour, I press it
at 37 as well for flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're pressing wetter flour or
something that's just dry, go slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna blow those bags out if it's
fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't press flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever either really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why a lot of the rosin that I
smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to be a hater here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why a lot of the rosin I smoke
tastes like straight popsicle sticks and
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt popcorn or what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A popsicle stick or burnt popcorn or a
woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you smoking flour rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: People bring me gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of friends who will bring
me gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell sometimes as soon as I
open it, it's got that just that woody
[SPEAKER_00]: turp that I do not appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think that's probably flour
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would honestly say that is probably,
well, not necessarily flour rosin like he
[SPEAKER_03]: just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be bubble hash just pressed at a
high temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I really get that burnt
popcorn taste to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the other thing too is,
Ryan said that he'll only press the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the buds that don't have bag appeal
also aren't the best buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your trim isn't the best material to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your best material to run is your your bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your good rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden, gold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might be getting trim run rosin,
which is a polished dog turd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a negative thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could polish a dog turd,
fuck, you've done a great job,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a hell of a task.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have done it correctly if you
started off properly with the right mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't expect gold from trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can never expect that in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm learning why this stuff is so
pricey, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have explained it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't walk in and stare at it and
go, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can make funny things out of BHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, all the pretty buds that you
see, they don't get smoked, they don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: put in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're washed and thrown into my garden
in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, yeah, the shit's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work that goes behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the money, holy Christ, I bet I've got
15 or $20,000 in my cold room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I mean, it's, it's,
it's tough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about that dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't realize what
somebody in your position, Ryan's
[SPEAKER_00]: position, my position, when you have a
niche product like that, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the dedication to it,
the commitment to just the equipment and
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the work after that,
which we'll talk about in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to keep on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got through temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about how about time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do we press this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we've got it in the press,
we bring down that weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take for the goop and the
gold to come out of there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for the group and gold to actually
start to come out pretty much when you
[SPEAKER_03]: reach full pressure, I usually hit my
timer button once I hit full pressure for
[SPEAKER_03]: hash minute and a half to two minutes
generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much pressure should we put on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using a seven ton press, but I don't
have actual pressure gauge where my bag
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will hit my timer when my bags hit
the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually do a 30 minute warmup,
or 30 minute, Jesus Christ, 30 second
[SPEAKER_01]: warmup.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, so you've just put 20 grams of
millions of little beach balls filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: oil into a bag, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're gonna put that bag and we're
gonna extract the oil that's in all these
[SPEAKER_01]: million little beach balls, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to extract the cuticles
of the beach balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to melt and then to give me
the oil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, when I press out of the
bag, I want oil to come out of the bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: not hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I allow it to melt for that 30 seconds
and I very slowly and very methodically,
[SPEAKER_01]: very systemically, that's not the word I
want to use, but systematically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Systematically, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase the pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, man, so I do give classes
because this gets very detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly tell us how we can find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedro's grow room, Pedro's grow room at
gmail.com or go to www.pedrosgrowroom.com
[SPEAKER_01]: and contact me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually haven't been giving them in the
last month, month and a half because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been so stupid busy, but I just bought
myself a laptop so that I can hopefully do
[SPEAKER_01]: classes and stuff on the road when I'm in
the hotel at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get ahold of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference between pressure
at the gauge, pressure at the plates and
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure at the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just use Ryan's here,
for example, for seven ton, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pressing at full pressure,
seven ton is 14,000 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now 14,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all understand that if I come
up to you and with an open palm in your
[SPEAKER_01]: chest and push, it's probably not going to
do much, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to push you back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I walk up to you with a really
sharp stick and stick it right in your
[SPEAKER_01]: chest and push with that same pressure,
things are going to happen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a difference in pressure over a
square, over your square inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just go with that two by four and
a half inch bag, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I fold it over and everything
is maybe two by four inches, eight square
[SPEAKER_01]: inches, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: 14,000 pounds divided by eight is where
we're at, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you have, that's about 2000
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll go close enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about actually perfect at the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right where you want to be,
literally right where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of your press, not straight
into it, butter it down, let it put,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you see the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the presses on my Ras and his
legal fuckers, they're sped up in four
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're four times speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that allows you to do you can,
aside from seeing me over there pumping
[SPEAKER_01]: it, every time you see it, just know I'm
over there giving it more pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why more is coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I realized that it was sped
up either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're all four times speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, some of those presses, some of the
latest ones that I've been doing where I
[SPEAKER_01]: waterfall them on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each press, from into the plates to set up
for my next press, is four minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I've done, if you see me doing 10,
15 presses on one piece of parchment,
[SPEAKER_01]: do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that camera sitting there
recording that entire time and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've realized now that people are going to
have to straight up ruin a few batches of
[SPEAKER_00]: presses, a few presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many do you think they're going to
ruin before they actually get the hang of
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I didn't put that into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: That story's on the washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't that how you get good at shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you guys got to be the people
that are on the show, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is by fucking up a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My god.
[SPEAKER_01]: I washed fresh frozen in my freaking
bathroom one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about wasting frothy product,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because by the end it was just
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible, horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the variable there is how soon did
you stop the bleeding and call me for
[SPEAKER_01]: classes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because you will ruin some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I expected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be good at it the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are, then you're not going to
be good at it the second and third time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not passionate, if you're
just in it for the dabs, wink wink,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're probably not going to want to
put through the effort to sit in that cold
[SPEAKER_01]: room for eight hours and do the work that
it's going to take to require to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: good rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of home growers really,
let's face it, are really going to
[SPEAKER_03]: probably press flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy a press for four or 500 bucks,
decent press, and they're going to make
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you to not, don't expect to be
blown away with by your flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just expect to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people to be self-sufficient,
to be able to go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I take great pride still at this
point in the game to grow something from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and harvest it and put it in the bong
and take a rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still go, yeah, I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my billionth time of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still feel like, yeah, I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be another feeling once
you've taken that from that flour to that
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen product, to that pressed product,
and then put it to the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to be a whole nother step of
relief and pride right there.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason that I say don't be,
you know, I don't want to stomp on people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are pressing flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want you to smoke flour rosin
and be like, well, this is shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pedro's, what the fuck were they
after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know that flour rosin is the bottom
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not the bottom of the bucket,
but it's towards the bottom of the bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, that's why for a couple
of years, I had a literally a bad taste
[SPEAKER_00]: for rosin in my mouth because I was being
given probably flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you started coming around a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live far from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Colorado, but we are hours and
hours away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like four and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd meet up in Denver and then you
changed my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Green Dot, Green Dot doesn't pay
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even give me any discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot started putting out rosin that
really blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same color, same texture as yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to buy some and I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buy more when they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it always sells out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You rosin nerds buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know it's there already?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they're the rosin nerds are like
following around the delivery guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I hope to pay attention when I
make my rosin come to the market the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been wondering for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no good rosin here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's why I make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing here, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rough up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our selection is very minimal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we're a very new legal state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our surrounding states, the quality is
very rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you find anything decent,
you are paying very big money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to bring it up on purpose,
but big shout out to New York for recently
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're up there in upstate New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up for joining the team legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your work a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to get parts and supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not as much of a sketch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully a career change someday,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see you running a facility
doing Pedro's job pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's I always have to remind myself
that it's it's not even a dream come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's monumentally more than a dream come
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost can't put into words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do when I go and this shit was illegal
when I was growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting I'm now getting paid to
extract concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mind boggling, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I never want to ever I hope to God I
never take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to God I never take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so dead and beyond exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope to God I never take it for
granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right there with your brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you remind me I'll do my best to remind
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for close to an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've covered most of the things I
had written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys can answer it quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ask for questions from the viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person just said what is with the
foam that forms when making bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it increase with each run?
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that I have to stop and change the
water and material after 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says after my fourth run,
he says I would sometimes I feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth run would be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with all the foam, I just say fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does have a lot more to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any idea why the foam guys surfactants
surfactants surfactants very potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying and flour, dust, dirt,
dander, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any oils can all be leading towards
towards foaminess in the wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over agitation can be leading towards
foaminess in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like I was going to say
beating the crap out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds very possible when he's talking
about fourth and fifth washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would immediately start firing questions
back to him asking how long he's
[SPEAKER_01]: agitating, what he's agitating in,
how much volume he's putting in his if
[SPEAKER_01]: he's using mechanical washers and only
filling up a halfway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way over agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of missing variables
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the most instance, it's either over
agitation or surfactants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that's one that you guys gave
a lot of info on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he'll he'll find an answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, if we didn't answer your
question properly, send me a follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I've got to do is text Pedro the
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on my team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really close, good resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, gentlemen, I think we've
covered a pretty good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any things that you would like
to add here at the end that I didn't ask
[SPEAKER_00]: or that you just want to put out to the
universe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big cheesy grin from Pedro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope people people find some value in
the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope people see the see the passion and
understand the pricing a little more like
[SPEAKER_01]: you just said that you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's worth the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if you enjoy quality
concentrate, it's worth the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me with the the headiness,
if you will, the new the new term of the
[SPEAKER_01]: headiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it all kind of goes hand in hand,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want if I'm smoking out of what I
consider one of the best glass pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the best concentrate to go through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I hope there's just an
appreciation and an understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess another thing is is it is
achievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is achievable by everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that's out of the
realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's safe to make you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no there's no boom boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out there and mess up a few batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to mess up a lot to get to the
level that these concentrate makers are
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to mess up a lot to get good at
anything in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep doing anything and you don't
make a few mistakes, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: big ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to find a bigger
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make mistakes in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get humbled, get corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most importantly, reach out to
Pedro for concentrate, for extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: for concentrate making classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Ryan, any final moments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any final thoughts from Ryan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you your Jerry Springer
moment here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like like I said, I mean, I guess cold,
cold, cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't don't overagitate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really pay attention to what you're making
and just enjoy it, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I think the bottom line is enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the most important part
that came from both you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy what we are doing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't supposed to be a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headaches that do come from it should
be learning lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, gentlemen, I want to thank you
guys once again for hanging out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
