[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 358 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the show by letting you
know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, it's got that sweet white
grapes going on, which I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the cross on this is lemon G
and jilly bean, but I can't be certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm certain of is it tastes
amazing and it has got me super high and
[SPEAKER_00]: super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've been working my way through
a long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a heads up at the beginning here,
I'm going to take a break from the lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: on this episode, but I'll get right back
into the grow talk on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're going to read some
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let's start with a little
update from LAX.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA International Airport put out a press
release recently, and we'll just jump
[SPEAKER_00]: right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: LAX marijuana policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: While federal law prohibits the possession
of marijuana, inclusive of federal
[SPEAKER_00]: airspace, California's passage of
Proposition 64, effective January 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, allows for individuals 21 years of
age or older to possess up to 28.5 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana and eight grams of
concentrated marijuana for personal
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: In accordance with Prop 64, the Los
Angeles Airport Police Department will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow passengers to travel through LAX
with up to 28.5 grams of marijuana and
[SPEAKER_00]: eight grams of concentrated marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, passengers should be aware that
marijuana laws vary state by state,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are encouraged to check with the
laws of the states in which they plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LAX, the Los Angeles International
Airport, has released their official
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you leave with 28.5 grams of
cannabis and eight grams of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The statement did not include anything
about what they would do if you tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel with more, so just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you're going, an ounce should be
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ounce and eight grams of concentrates
should be plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a short trip anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second half of their statement was a
reminder that it is your responsibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the legality of cannabis in
your destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you are landing, you need to know
the rules and laws regarding medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: or recreational cannabis in that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states have a reciprocal medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a medical marijuana patient in
one state and you fly to these states that
[SPEAKER_00]: allow out of state medical marijuana
patients to have access to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana there, you should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were flying to a state that does
not allow cannabis, just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are probably going to pick up your
luggage and leave the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you are just in civilization with
cannabis in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you've got to transfer planes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you're like our friend,
White Mike, who as soon as he gets off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plane, the first thing he's thinking about
is getting a cigarette into his lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't run out of the airport, go smoke a
cigarette and then have to go back through
[SPEAKER_00]: security and Dallas, Texas, where they're
not going to be cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep stuff like that in mind if you were
traveling with your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: LAX didn't care that you had an ounce of
herb and eight grams of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you make that transfer in Kansas
City or in Chicago, are they going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: OK with that stuff you've got in your
backpack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan ahead and pay attention and you
should be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to a comedian friend of mine
who travels with cannabis quite frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was asking him how he feels so
comfortable just putting his weed in his
[SPEAKER_00]: carry on and flying across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, dude, the TSA does not care.
[SPEAKER_00]: The TSA told him specifically they're not
looking for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't hurt anybody on a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weapons and bombs hurt people on planes,
so they don't care about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time they don't give a
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are those TSA agents that
want to be heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they find a little something on you,
they want to call the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to call airport security.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always be prepared for dipshits in the
world like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, the TSA does not
care about your ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a statement from the Los
Angeles International Airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that they've made it clear not only
for travelers, but also for airport
[SPEAKER_00]: security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have less opportunity for rogue
TSA agents to try to cause you a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with your cannabis in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a completely different approach
than what they did in Denver at the Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: International Airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up what are called amnesty boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically trash cans with a sign
on it that reminds you that it's illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave the state with your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expect people with leftover product
to just drop their cannabis in these
[SPEAKER_00]: little trash cans and then you can travel
safely with nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time anybody spoke about these
amnesty boxes, nobody has ever put
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a friend who travels through the
Denver International Airport on a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: basis and she takes her medicine with her
and they've never given her any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like as long as you are not
traveling with weapons or explosives,
[SPEAKER_00]: the TSA at the Denver International
Airport is not concerned with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, again, keep in mind the
legalities of cannabis in your
[SPEAKER_00]: destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I am not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't claim to be one and I don't play
one on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never take legal advice from a guy who
calls himself Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are a couple of more things to think
about while I'm on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not try to travel with your torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take your torch from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The torch is unacceptable to go on the
plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used as a weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't let you take your torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very selective about your dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a happy daddy dabber,
happy daddy makes the dabbers that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fucking knife on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not let you take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will confiscate that from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, if you're going to travel
with medicine and you are okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you feel safe with your medicine,
in your destination, take it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are much more likely to get your
medical marijuana stolen from you by TSA
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is packed in your suitcase and going
under the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they inspect that stuff, they'll
steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no eye contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just taking shit out of a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really easy for a person to do
without any sort of guilty conscience or
[SPEAKER_00]: second thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it on you if that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it in your carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you're going through LAX,
they don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver doesn't seem to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a case-by-case basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do plan to travel with product,
stay under the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In LAX, it's 28.5 grams, which is more
than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you get eight grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's plenty of cannabis to travel with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in Colorado, they haven't spoken
about the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got personal medicine,
they don't seem to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is stay under your
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is don't take a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A torch is intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you fly with that, it goes up
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take a torch with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will cause you issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other thing to think about is
your dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your dabber going to be misconstrued as
a weapon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be used as a weapon?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to look like a weapon or
maybe be intimidating, but could you use
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a weapon?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be considered a weapon if you can
use it as one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when you're packing
your dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a rig and a nail with you,
the TSA is going to want to open up your
kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to open up your
Pelican case and take the glass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to make sure there's
nothing else in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably run your case through the
x-ray machine or the scanning device of
[SPEAKER_00]: their choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an expensive rig,
make them aware of the value of that rig
[SPEAKER_00]: before you open the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can communicate with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to them like an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say, what's in the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just say, it's glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's functional glass art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say, yes, say,
this is worth this much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a $10,000 piece of functional
glass art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you touch this, I need you to know
that, but there's nothing wrong with you
[SPEAKER_00]: inspecting my case and they can look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got accessories in the case,
make sure you make everything safe for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my simple advice for if you do
choose to travel with a rig, don't take a
[SPEAKER_00]: torch, don't take a dangerous dabber and
don't take too much product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, you should be just fine
based on your destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a lawyer.
Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take legal advice from a dude who
calls himself a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: in an ounce if you round that up it is
28.35 grams for an ounce now i know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying 0.35 grams not a big deal well
let's do 0.35 grams on the calculator we
[SPEAKER_00]: start off with one ounce if we do let's
start like this let's do 28 grams times
[SPEAKER_00]: four a quarter pound right 28 times four
is 112 28.35 times four comes out to 113.4
[SPEAKER_00]: now that's not that much of a difference
but in today's market every gram and every
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar should count so start thinking
about that 0.35 let's do it on a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: scale 0.35 times 16 ounces that's 5.6
grams you're shorting a pound if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: weighing 28 gram ounces your pound will be
5.6 grams short and if we keep going and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep compounding because in today's market
we buy way more than just one pound we
[SPEAKER_00]: usually buy five or ten pound lots at
minimum and in a five pound transaction if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were weighing your ounces to 28 grams
you come to 28 grams short over a five
[SPEAKER_00]: pound transaction so that's a full ounce
you have now shorted your customer it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't sound like a lot of product on
that large of a scale it doesn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of money on that large of a
scale but when things are getting so tight
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry every gram and every
dollar should count for both the buyer and
[SPEAKER_00]: the seller so let's get all on the same
page let's start functioning on a 28.35
[SPEAKER_00]: gram ounce so there is no argument and
let's do the math real quick here 28.35
[SPEAKER_00]: times four you should have 113.4 grams and
a quarter pound 28.35 times eight a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound 226.8 be friendly make it 227 don't
be a dick 28.35 times 16 you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: 453.6 if you want to round that up that's
454 grams in a pound if you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly that's 455 grams in a pound but
like i said every gram and every dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: should count in today's market be a fair
seller and people will be happy buyers
[SPEAKER_00]: alright you guys that is my two cents on
one ounce i hope you learned something
[SPEAKER_00]: from that you guys i need to press pause i
need to get a drink i'll probably take a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of dabs and when we get back we're
going to read some emails from some
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners take a dab with me boys and
girls and i'll be right back alright
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast world i am back i am heavily
medicated and well hydrated let's get
[SPEAKER_00]: right into these emails if you'd like to
send me an email the email address is grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com you know
i'd like to hear from you this first
[SPEAKER_00]: message goes like this i've been enjoying
your learning to grow series i've been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for many years now but while i was
listening i was reminded of my biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake during my first grow i had a male
so i cut it up and flushed it down the
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet back then i didn't know plant
material will actually swell up when
[SPEAKER_00]: submerged in water the plant got stuck in
the whole house trap in my yard and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it swelled up and plugged the pipe nothing
in the house would drain after freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: out for a while i rented a power snake and
spent the next eight hours bringing up
[SPEAKER_00]: disgusting shitty bits of weed plant back
up my sewer pipe everyone fucks up now and
[SPEAKER_00]: then keep up the good work so this
listener had a male plant and they cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down and cut it into pieces and flushed it
down the toilet which ended up clogging up
[SPEAKER_00]: their whole drainage system you guys
nothing grow related should go down the
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet not plant material not wastewater
not leftover nutrients not runoff water
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not pesticides all of that
stuff finds its way back to our municipal
[SPEAKER_00]: water supply and gets fed back to us so
keep our water supply clean and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what goes down the toilet
also you may get yourself in trouble if
[SPEAKER_00]: you cause a major clog and you can't
unclog it somebody has to come out maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the city maybe the city hires somebody
whoever comes they stick something down in
[SPEAKER_00]: there they pull out half of a weed plant
they're going to want to find out where
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of that weed plant is and where
it came from and find out if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: more plants there so don't flush your weed
plants down the toilet you guys that will
[SPEAKER_00]: not work that is not a proper way of
disposing of your plants i want to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge shout out to this listener for first
acknowledging that they made a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake and then second for having the
heart to admit it and share it with us so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't make a similar mistake in
our garden and in our homes now my next
[SPEAKER_00]: message comes from dave in the uk and it
goes like this hey rasta jeff just a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: text from the uk love the podcasts i've
had them on back to back for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after discovering you great job
buddy hey dave thanks for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments that's a great way to start a
message he goes on to say reminded me of
[SPEAKER_00]: so many things i knew but forgot thanks
for that one thing i just listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 300 great fucking laugh by the way
hey dude thanks for laughing with us i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: glad you are learning and laughing at the
same time that always makes it fun he says
[SPEAKER_00]: plus in a couple other episodes you were
talking about popping or pinching the
[SPEAKER_00]: stems i've not heard of this any chance
you could explain this technique and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's beneficial to your grow when i
learned about it through soma he was
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it supercropping i adapted the
technique and started doing it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens i got pretty good at it i started
using it in commercial grows one day i was
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to another grower who does a
method of supercropping but he goes way
[SPEAKER_00]: harder than i had ever thought of going i
would pop the stems a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the cycle and that would be it
this guy gets in there about every 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days and pops every inch of the plant
as soon as they're big enough to take it
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as they can tolerate it in veg he
starts cracking them and he encourages
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking the stems all the way through
about the third week of flower so we
[SPEAKER_00]: started implementing the supercropping
technique along with a trellis and netting
[SPEAKER_00]: system and that tremendously increased our
yields and productivity of the plants now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk a little bit about what i'm
doing why i'm doing it and why it works
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the challenges of dealing with fast
growing cannabis plants in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're growing some plants don't like
to get too close to those gavitas so we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to keep height in mind when we're
growing so how can i slow down some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that vertical growth but still keep strong
robust plants i thought that by cracking
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems and making the branches and the
stalks thicker the plants would be thicker
[SPEAKER_00]: and wider and they wouldn't have to grow
as tall also as i'm cracking them that
[SPEAKER_00]: slows them down a little bit from getting
taller they're working more on repairing
[SPEAKER_00]: the cracks that i just made now i'm
getting ahead of myself let me talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the actual method of popping the
stems as soon as my plant is transplanted
[SPEAKER_00]: into a three gallon pot it's probably big
enough to start cracking i will grab the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at the base of the stock right where
it comes out of the medium right where it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of your soil your cocoa whatever
you're using i grab it you may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab it like with your whole fist you may
be able to grab it with two fingers it
[SPEAKER_00]: just depends on the size of the stock if
it's the size of a pencil or bigger this
[SPEAKER_00]: should work if you're kind of clumsy maybe
you want to work with a plant that's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker stock maybe like a sharpie marker
but this is what i do i grab the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: with one hand maybe two fingers in my
thumb then right above that i grab it with
[SPEAKER_00]: my other hand maybe two fingers maybe the
whole hand depends on how i can grab it
[SPEAKER_00]: then i turn my hands opposite directions
just give it a little twist and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: hear just a little knuckle popping sound
you're basically going to give it the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of an indian burn and what you want
to do is crack the cellulose wall you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to break the plant fiber you don't
want to bend it over you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: topple it you just want to twist it until
you hear the plant fiber just snap it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make a real obvious cracking sound it'll
just be a little and you'll just say oh
[SPEAKER_00]: that's exactly what i was looking for
you'll feel it you'll hear it it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like popping your knuckle so give it a
little twist and then i leave my hand that
[SPEAKER_00]: was on top right in place and i take the
hand that was on the bottom and just put
[SPEAKER_00]: it above the hand that is now on the
bottom and then i repeat the process and i
[SPEAKER_00]: just work my way up the stock and i'll do
a crack every couple of inches crack put
[SPEAKER_00]: my hand up top crack move the next hand up
crack move my hand up crack and just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: going up the stock i'll do the main stock
all the way up until it gets real skinny
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the top then i'll go to the bottom
branches and i'll start cracking the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom branches and work my way all the
way up to the top of each plant we will
[SPEAKER_00]: spend an entire day in one room popping
stems in a commercial grow every stem gets
[SPEAKER_00]: a good twisting and popping now we start
this in veg and when we started in veg it
[SPEAKER_00]: does slow the plants down from growing too
tall which is good but it makes them get
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker more robust stocks everywhere
where we broke the stock a little bit it
[SPEAKER_00]: creates a little knuckle there on the
plant and i feel like those little
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckles create stronger sturdier stocks
and stronger sturdier stocks can hold up
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger thicker fatter buds also i feel
like those thicker fatter stocks can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably provide more nutrient flow and
more water flow to the bigger thick fat
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that we're trying to produce so i
start cracking in veg to start building a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong robust structure i'm just working
them out i'm making them beefy i'm putting
[SPEAKER_00]: some weight on them i'm basically putting
a collar with a tire on it making my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants drag around that chain and tire all
day so they get thick and beefy and then i
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing that through veg and then i
continue to do that through flour and at
[SPEAKER_00]: the start of flour we clean up the bottoms
of them and we also defoliate heavy so now
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are being cracked and they
don't have all the stuff on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have as much leaf to work with
they've got a lot more structure and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more sturdiness without all the excess
weight on them we've kind of taken that
[SPEAKER_00]: dog chain and that tire off i know those
plants can run like an olympic athlete
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like we've been training and we're
ready to go we keep cracking them for
[SPEAKER_00]: about three weeks into flower because the
plants stretch heavily when we put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower that crack really slows down
that stretch they spend more time
[SPEAKER_00]: repairing that crack than they do taking
off but they still transition very
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly into the flowering process and
then we quit cracking them as bud sets so
[SPEAKER_00]: that way they can quit spending their
energy on repairing that cellulose
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and they can start spending all
of their energy on producing luscious buds
[SPEAKER_00]: after you get comfortable with popping and
twisting you'll learn how to start bending
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to where you can point the
branches where you want them to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the way of each other or maybe fill
in a little space maybe you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little open section over here and two
branches are crowded here you'll learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to just grab a branch and pop it and bend
it to the direction you want you can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of pop it two or three times in different
places and totally change the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: a branch that'll start coming in handy
then you'll learn how to put up a trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: net and then you'll start popping the
branches and twisting them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis net and that's when you really
start learning how to shape the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape the canopy to start maximizing your
square footage for your canopy so that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the main purpose of cracking and popping
and twisting the stems it does slow the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down in vertical growth in the
beginning but once they heal from it they
[SPEAKER_00]: do take off and you have more productive
more robust plants and I think popping and
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting your plants is kind of a good
training guide on getting good at
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising your plants it'll teach you how
to work the branches into the net a little
[SPEAKER_00]: better it'll make you more comfortable at
just grabbing a branch and giving it a
[SPEAKER_00]: twist giving it a bend you'll learn what
the plants can tolerate and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: won't take you'll learn eventually that
you can go way lower if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: bend this branch into the trellis you may
not want to grab it six inches down and
[SPEAKER_00]: pop it you may want to go 12 or 18 inches
down give it one good twist and a pop
[SPEAKER_00]: there move up four or six inches give it
another pop there and use both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: two lower pops to start changing the
direction of that branch so that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more space to work with and then
that branch is going to grow up no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what so you can kind of pop it down low
bend it the way you need it get it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the net and then it's going to grow back
up so popping and twisting is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: starter to that that's where you learn how
to do it then you'll throw up a trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'll really get good at popping and
twisting and working into that net system
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's why it's beneficial that's where
it comes in super handy in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow system and I feel like it really
makes the plants more productive once they
[SPEAKER_00]: recover from all the popping and twisting
that we do to them so that is why I do
[SPEAKER_00]: popping and twisting and super cropping in
a commercial grow I hope that gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: another kick in the arse to do a little
more work in the garden I hope you enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting the lemon Jeffrey souvenirs hey
dude thanks for the great message and also
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for all of the support alright
podcast world I'm going to wrap up this
[SPEAKER_00]: quick show I know I interrupted the grow
lessons I just wanted to jump in and talk
