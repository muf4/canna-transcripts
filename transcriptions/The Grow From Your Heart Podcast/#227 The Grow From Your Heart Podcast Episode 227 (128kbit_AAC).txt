[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 227 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Kood, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it all the way through the intro
without a cough, without a wheeze,
[SPEAKER_03]: without a sneeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
show, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing very well, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we announce your new situation on the
show here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I ask you first, I guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so most of you folks probably know
that I am the lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the cult leader at Three Rivers
Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Mike is officially on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is part of the Three Rivers Cultivation
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm part of the team now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the cult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining the cult with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drank the Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the only place that's getting
announced too, so I feel special for
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is the official announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to stalk Mike on the social
medias, you should follow him at
[SPEAKER_03]: Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should also check out his Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I tried to do a decent intro for my
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you got a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike posts a whole bunch of great
cannabis-related news and information.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several Facebook pages that are
cannabis haters, and they like to post a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mike only posts the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I support 99% of what Mike posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I don't agree with is just
opinionated stuff from other writers
[SPEAKER_03]: having opinions on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The science and the facts and the
politics, I fucking agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun because I get hate on that page
from both sides of the cannabis argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get activists that are upset that I
won't post their latest meme, and I get
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-pop people pissed that I exist at all
and keep debunking their bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The meme game is a whole different...
That's middle school, and we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: play college-level cannabis politics here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's doing it for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Articulate the argument is sort of the
page's basic concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and fade that music
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awkward when it's that low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, fade it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to the beautiful
sounds of mystic roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relax to the mellow sounds of the rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me do a little correction.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the last episode, there's a group
called PL Grow that's going to send me a
[SPEAKER_03]: test item.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a product for me to review.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't quite gotten it to me yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucked up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said they are from Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not from Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're from the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Important correction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got to rep the right people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They emailed me like, just one small
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're from the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not from Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I apologize, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you got two shout outs on the show
instead of just one because I made a
[SPEAKER_03]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, gosh, Mike, I don't know what
happened, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike went down to go smoke a cigarette
before the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while he was out there, I just started
coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: My throat just started acting like... And
my lungs started juicing up on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were dabbing before the show,
my traditional cough didn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: materialize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have taken your cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have a sympathy cough for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a real thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs are magic, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magic, sympathy, dab, cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took plenty of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I had a delayed cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking some of the... What did I
have?
[SPEAKER_03]: The killer queen, high cannabinoid,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we were dabbing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it was, it was really tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me dab out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after a couple of minutes,
it just made me start like... He starts
[SPEAKER_02]: eating the banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And immediately the room smelled
delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because I've been smoking... The
beautiful Miss Jenny Beth went to
[SPEAKER_03]: Apothecary and she got some of the
clementine.
[SPEAKER_03]: She got the... I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she had the high cannabinoid,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I picked up some of the high terp,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were tag team dabbing each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went a little hard on the
terps and put it in the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just tastes like that forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've been pouring a lot of the...
I've got these little lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_03]: high terpene, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the flavor of... Is that what's in
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pour this in there, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pour these little things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But two, maybe three or four drops,
depending on where I'm trying to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a small dab and four drops of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dude, you just blow clouds and there's
something in these little terps right here
[SPEAKER_03]: that do... There's cannabinoids in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just pure terps, but it's mostly
terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do terps have a lot to do with where the
high goes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the THC makes you go... It makes
you go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the terps decide if you get the
munchies, if you get an high high,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you get creative, if you want to do the
dishes, if you get panicky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the terps are all about... Pain
relief.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pain relief.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the terps have a lot to do with
the pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of different stuff that
the terps are affecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just fun aspects of the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's medical aspects of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the limonene, which is what this
is mainly... At least that's my personal
[SPEAKER_02]: take.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the... I talk about it way too
much on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it feels like my brain skips
like an old CD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just fucking... The song will be
played.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when you had a disc man?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are going, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember CDs you guys back in the day,
these silver shiny things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those used to skip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would sound like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes my brain does the part and it's
from a fucking traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dent in my brain where
information skips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just falls out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like dumb shit that I don't
really need to remember is what left.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the important shit has been
coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like the limonene puts a little
patch in the divot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts some bondo in the brain dent and
it helps that... The bridge that got
[SPEAKER_03]: broken, it helps it reconnect.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get the black cherry flavor,
I know that along with that flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a really nice hit of pain
relief in about four to eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that cannabinoid that's really
helpful with the pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm frying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't think about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at new lights flashing on the
board across from me and I got distracted
[SPEAKER_02]: and dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn off the iPad so you can't see
the screen also.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD and then common terpenes that you
find alongside CBD that add that flavor to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My tongue knows that when that hits,
my eyes light up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start looking for where it came from
and where I can get more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did an episode a while back called
Follow Your Nose, because I believe that
[SPEAKER_03]: your body and your nose know what's best
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why oranges smell... And I said
this in the other episode, I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: repeating myself at this point,
but that's why I said oranges smell good
[SPEAKER_03]: and shit smells bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to eat oranges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oranges make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have vitamin C, they have natural
sugar, there's fiber, there's other stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's fiber in there,
but I assume there'd be fiber and calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: and a goddamn orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not supposed to eat that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it smells bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's shit in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason 99% of people salivate
when they smell meat over fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how people didn't die of starvation
for most of our history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with fresh fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're in a supermarket and you're
just a little bit hungry and you get hit
[SPEAKER_02]: with that fresh fruit smell, off the
oranges for me, I stare at them and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, all right, now I have to buy four.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't happen so much with the pears
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Jenny Beth, she loves oranges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oranges is her turp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that fixes her... That's
her medical and her recreational smoke is
[SPEAKER_03]: orange turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: My kid goes mad for citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the lemon turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Kelly, she doesn't smoke
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You met Kelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't consume cannabis, but she
hates the smell of oranges.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, orange anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lavender is what she likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: She told me that lavender and lilacs are
her type of thing, which is really funny
[SPEAKER_03]: because lilacs and lavender make me feel
like I inhaled something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all three of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lilacs and lavender are not for me.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the two don't make me hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one does.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to be calming and
relaxing smells and they honestly just
[SPEAKER_03]: bother the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a calm and relaxed person.
[SPEAKER_02]: My whole house reeks of lavender,
like constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, I do have a podcast
planned, but when Mike comes...
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the comfort of when you just show
up, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun working with you now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't a planned show necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, we both finally found 45 free
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, bro, what are you doing
tonight?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I don't know, podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yes, come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he called me and he's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thanks for taking time away from the
kid and the wife also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Jen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you don't listen, but hey,
shout out wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move on to some shit on a
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We promised them a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody the other day, a friend of
mine is building a grow and he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so Rasta Jeff, what is the secret weapon?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a magic bullet for my grow that I
can buy that will give me the highest THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: the best flavor, the biggest yields?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I buy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a specific reason and a
specific bullet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your answer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I want to hear yours because I get to
talk a lot on a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking grow book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go buy the grow book, read the grow book.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there goes the episode I wrote.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking, we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a fat dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason that's the only silver
bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you need to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never grown cannabis before,
you don't know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what the parameters are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what its needs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and are going to be down the line as
it progresses through its life cycle and
[SPEAKER_02]: the easiest way to get that shit figured
out and get going successfully is to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: a bookstore, pick out any grow book on the
shelf, buy it and read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's got two or three of the best
cannabis growers as teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm, I'm one of his teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sees me on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got another guy that is a very good
teacher that's been to his grow also,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'll help them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but he was, and you're right,
Mike, you're, you're fucking so right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I can't believe I didn't tell him,
yes, go buy a damn grow book, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, no, honestly, there is no
one magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought that if he bought a specific
light that he would do it, he thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe I could tell him by this bottle and
it would do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had to tell him there's no secret
weapon, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no ninja sword.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, you can't just get one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what I had to explain to him was,
and this is just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grow book is the secret weapon,
you guys, to everything knowledge is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go get yourself a grow book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I recommend, uh, there's an Ed
Rosenthal book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Oakster damn course guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend that book.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good book.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with the grow book is like
every six months, they're fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: outdated.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the, the nice thing about any grow,
any grow guide, I mean, even some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: more advanced ones, the more, um,
topical ones, they're going to cover the
[SPEAKER_02]: basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an advanced class knowing a lot
more will produce significantly better
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you know the basic rules of the
game, you can take your ass to any fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: field and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you sit down and read any grow
book, it's going to lay out, here's the
[SPEAKER_02]: ABCDE basic level one checklist that you
need to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's what you need to know
super basic about lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what you need to know super basic
about feeding, um, light and dark periods,
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, here's a small list of common pitfalls
that people fall into to look out for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually just nailed a couple of
things that I was going to, what I was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to mention to the person that asked
me this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I told him, basically what I told him
was there's no magic secret weapon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is what matters the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you have to dial in everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants start at a 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants start at their highest
potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are tens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically we fuck them up by limiting
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to find out how to limit them
and get out of their way as much as you
[SPEAKER_03]: can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to, and I wrote down LAWS laws as
something that every grower should know
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lights, air, water, and soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the main things you need to
worry about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have the best lighting you can
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I know I just said, you have to
have the best you can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the best lighting you can afford and
maintain and maintain in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a small space, don't put a
2000 watt fucking setup in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a small space, go get
yourself a T5, go get yourself a fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: LED and put it in the small space.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got big space, put big lights in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I answer this question,
the person I'm talking to seems incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: hesitant to take the advice of go buy the
book because they're excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your high ass can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem complicated at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if you could just take the
seed you found in your bag out in your
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard and water it with your
sprinklers, like you do your flower bed
[SPEAKER_02]: and not get robbed and killed or arrested
for doing so, it would be a lot simpler.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because you're attempting to take
something out of its environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: create an environment where it will thrive
artificially, there's some ground rules
[SPEAKER_02]: that you just need to familiarize yourself
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, when until you sit down and
write the book, you don't really like
[SPEAKER_02]: triple check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I hitting every point that a new person
is going to need to know to be successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want to do a consult for a dude when
I was first starting out doing consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I forgot like three important things
when I was there the first day that I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't think about till I got home and I
sent the dude a long email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, I'm really sorry,
but this, this and this I don't know why
[SPEAKER_02]: that didn't occur to me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't include all of this information
during your physical consult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to ask me more questions over
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, bro, not driving back North Glen
North Glen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get to the point of
publishing a grow guide, you and a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: other growers have gone over and been
like, yep, bro, you hit all the steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you go from the dugout to home
plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you got the book, you still got
to worry about, you've got the grow built
[SPEAKER_03]: and now your plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you still can't just buy one thing to
put in that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get good lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got to get, I recommend the
Gavitas if you've got a big space.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a little space, get the
Gavita 750s or the 650s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just work your way down based on
your space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have, and there's no magic
nutrients you can buy, you got to do the
[SPEAKER_03]: research and you got to find, figure out
if you want to use organic, figure out if
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to use non-organic, figure out
it's up to you how you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all the more non-organic and this
may, a lot of people are going to argue
[SPEAKER_03]: with me, but this is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more non-organic you go, the more
bottle based you get, the more simple it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you work more towards the
organics, there's a little more work to
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but it's also a little more pleasing
product to some people to know it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike just gave me kind of a... I know a
couple of organic people that they could
[SPEAKER_02]: spend three years trying to teach me their
method and I'd only know a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know bottle people that are the same
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just picturing in my head the full
advanced line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, unnecessary, highly unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, there's a lot of that shit that's
insanely unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do everything with the advanced
nutrients line does with VegBloom and two
[SPEAKER_03]: or three bottles of extra additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where taking the time to do a
little research and education comes in
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the Grow Store, ask the person
behind the counter lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even ask the Grow Store dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Grow Store dude is paid to sell a
certain fucking brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: He uses a certain brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that pisses me off about Grow
Stores, and it also happens at Guitar
[SPEAKER_03]: Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens at Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go somewhere and Guitar Center is
fucking notorious for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, hey, I want to buy these kind
of drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the drum guy goes, fuck those sticks,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I play these sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all that fucking matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he spins his sticks and flips his hair
around like he's cooler than everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't fucking care about
your emo band.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want these sticks I came for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel like they do the same shit
at Grow Stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, hey man, I came to buy
Botanic Care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck Botanic Care, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use Psycho, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they treat you like they're better
than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't like that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They push whatever brand whose rep has a
special going on that month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whichever brand threw them free shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whichever brand gave them a fucking
hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is about to expire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look and see what shirt they're wearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's what they're pitching you,
I mean somebody's fucking doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are plenty of places to do your
research on which new line to use and
[SPEAKER_02]: which gear to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been using for years, Botanic Care
Pure Blend Pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been bought out by a company that
I'm not sure I want to support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I run out of Botanic Care Pure
Blend Pro product, Pure Blend Pro
[SPEAKER_03]: products, that's hard as fuck to say when
you're as high as I am to tell you the
[SPEAKER_03]: goddamn truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to switch to another
brand that is small.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if I want to say the name
of the company on the show, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now because I'm going to switch to New
Millennium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be using Veg Bloom Base with New
Millennium Additives and Shine and Plus
[SPEAKER_03]: Life and Mammoth P. That's what I plan on
switching to in the long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a slow process because I've got a
lot of Botanic Care products left.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once those are gone, it'll be replaced
with New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not happy about that purchase
either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big companies and that's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would recommend Veg Bloom is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want something simple, Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Veg Bloom, the one for the
dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for hard water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of you guys probably live in an area
where you've got hard water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want the dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Veg Bloom dirty, add Shine, add Plus Life,
spray them with Push and then maybe add
[SPEAKER_03]: like some Mammoth P. It's not even
necessary if you're using the Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was using the Mammoth P to start them to
get them going faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe something you might need
some Cal Mag in there, maybe a kelp
[SPEAKER_03]: product just to beef them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, the Plus Life, the Shine and
the Push spray is you can get through the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole process with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If what Jeff said just now didn't make a
lot of sense to you, please go buy the
[SPEAKER_02]: book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or go to the Veg Bloom website.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't pay me or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like the Veg Bloom products.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super easy to use and they give
great results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And listen to back episodes of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the correct strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Kush type strains, Veg Bloom is
fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: For other strains, it doesn't do as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got like an OG Kush or a
Grateful Dog type of strain, the Veg Bloom
[SPEAKER_03]: will do wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like I was trying to get at
something else, but for certain strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember something else I was
going to say on there, but I was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: say to go to hydroponicresearch.com,
hydroponic-research.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Veg Bloom website.
[SPEAKER_03]: All their information is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be feed charts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking three dry products and a
foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to quit pitching Veg Bloom
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get your pH dialed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to find out what pH those plants
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start at six five and see what's happening
with your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn how do I identify pH problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raise them up or down if you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hardly ever check the pH of my soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't ever checked the pH of the soil
in the fucking commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never checked the pH of the cocoa at
the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked the runoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked the pH of the runoff and I
checked the EC, the electrical
[SPEAKER_03]: conductivity of the runoff, but I do not
check the fucking cocoa itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell what's going on by what goes in
and what comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing you got to keep in mind is
the CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are augmenting CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give it a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: The natural environment rocks around 400
PPMs of CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plants can take, I've seen people
push them up to the 2,200 PPMs of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people run around 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We rock about 1,500 at the big grow,
but you can push them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to dial in temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have temperature swings?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it too hot during the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it too cold during the night?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it too hot during the night,
too cold during the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of that is going to fuck with your
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no one magic thing so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already read off a list of seven or
eight things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moisture in the soil, moisture in the
room, floor temperature, leaf surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floor temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a tour of a major facility not that
long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants on concrete in February,
bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take off your shoes and walk around on the
concrete.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I saw that in a how to
build your grow room video, in the video
[SPEAKER_02]: is he's showing people how to build his
little room in Amsterdam, busts his shoes
[SPEAKER_02]: and socks off and walks around on the
floor and he's like, this is way too cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes and installs some pads on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just rocked my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have thought of that before,
but huge effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got these pots filled with dirt and
roots and then you're going to pour water
[SPEAKER_03]: into it and it's going to get cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ice cold on that floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in a warehouse or a
basement, it's going to get chilly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super chilly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The acronym you gave out earlier,
I liked that the four points that it hit
[SPEAKER_02]: and I liked that it spelled out laws
because that's the one thing we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: bring up so far in shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should take a minute to look up if you
want to be successful growing the local
[SPEAKER_02]: laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to know those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we live in a legal state.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally legal to grow here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell of marijuana is no longer
probable cause in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had cops pounding on my door,
wondering if I knew my neighbor because
[SPEAKER_02]: they thought he was growing and why he
wouldn't answer his door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, he ain't home,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, there's six cars in the
driveway, but the one he drives every day
[SPEAKER_02]: there like have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, you know, kept talking to me and
they're like, yeah, we know he's growing a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of weed because and get this
folks, they accused him of screwing up
[SPEAKER_02]: people's cable connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are radio frequencies in the
area with his little tiny home grow with
[SPEAKER_03]: the right amount of ballasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually possible with the right
equipment and the right number of pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fuck with radio frequencies a
little bit, but you can't fuck with no
[SPEAKER_02]: people's cable, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to fake probable cause
it was the, the other person that was
[SPEAKER_02]: staying with me at the time mentioned
something about our cable while the cop
[SPEAKER_02]: happened to be standing in earshot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he tried to like use it as a,
an in with me like bro, dude, the jerk
[SPEAKER_02]: next door that's growing weed is fucking
up your TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to find a way to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for a fact, the dude next door is a
hundred percent legal cause he showed off
[SPEAKER_02]: his grow to me one night, like super proud
of having finished building it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I high-fived him and like made
sure to wash my clothes right after it
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it wasn't pro status, but it was
small and couldn't possibly fit more than
[SPEAKER_02]: six plants, let alone exceed any sort of
limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even in our little place, they're
worried about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not the cops that notice that
you're growing weed and are interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, it's the neighborhood teenagers or the
creepy biker dude up the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just, you're going to want to think
about all that stuff before you go down
[SPEAKER_02]: this road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you don't, that's where the
really nasty problems and headaches and
[SPEAKER_02]: black eyes for the community come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude who throws 30 plants in his
backyard, stinks out the neighborhood and
[SPEAKER_02]: ends up shooting one of the local
teenagers during harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's doing an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who this guy is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look up the local laws that you know
how to best protect yourself and what
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters you want to operate under.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a good another point to look up
is all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that goes right along
with the type of nutrients you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the type of that shows,
you know, those, the kind of person you
[SPEAKER_03]: are, the type of nutrients you buy,
the amount of attention you pay to the
[SPEAKER_03]: law, that's all going to reflect in your
garden and the type of person that you
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all right, let's focus back down on
here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike wants you to buy books and follow the
rules a lot, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a lot of credit to what I'm
talking about to a guy known as Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soma is a cannabis breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wears a bunch of crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of a weird dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of used to look up to him quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He teaches us about a thing called
mimetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says that there are 64 squares on the
chess board and every one of them is an
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to improve or fuck up your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about where you're putting your
Kings and Queens of the chess board and
[SPEAKER_03]: play chess the best that you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mimetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the things in your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not Google this word.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just from my memory from what Soma
told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mimetics is all the things in your
environment combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every little detail that you can see and
cannot see, can control and cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are mimetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that Mike is looking off into the
distance right now, like he's confused,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is part of the mimetics of my
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it doesn't affect me,
it is still part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow it's the mimetics of this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The airflow coming out of that duct.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things on my chess
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: That light coming from above.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things on my chess
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: The window open over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the parts of my chess board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all affecting my environment and
my performance right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every one of those things has a very
small impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dr. Pepper, the water, the dab rig,
all of those things have, this phone right
[SPEAKER_03]: here is distracting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those things have a few pieces of
mimetics on my chess board and your plants
[SPEAKER_03]: have the same option in the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every piece of dust in there is part of
that grow environment that's affecting
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant in some weird way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Soma for putting the
mimetics idea into my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: My head that kind of put a lot of,
it opened up a lot of stuff in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're really creating an
artificial environment for a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amount of little pieces that can
impact that in the environment you create
[SPEAKER_02]: is just limitless.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times have we stood in the same
grow room looking for new issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: issues we haven't seen before,
issues that have come up since the last
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning and just knowing what to look out
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a long time to be able to look
into a space and think, okay, if I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a small grow here, these are the
things that are going to be major issues
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the things I'm going to need to
upgrade or purchase, or this is the kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of size I could get away with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just taking the time to understand what
your parameters are, it's going to help
[SPEAKER_02]: you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's hard to know where to put the
pieces on a chess board if you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: how to play the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure that mimetics is the word I'm
looking for now that I'm kind of looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at it on Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But shout out to Soma for teaching me a
word I fucking forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be mimetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wikipedia for mimetics is really not
what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I wrote down is you can't put
turbos on an 86 Ford Escort and expect to
[SPEAKER_03]: win a race.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to build a race car,
you got to get a racing transmission.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get yourself a racing
steering wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a racing harness.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you motherfuckers need a helmet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to race, you got to get
all the racing gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just throw up some big lights
and think that that was the main point of
[SPEAKER_03]: this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just buy one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get it all correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've got a budget, I would say
start with the lights, then go nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: then work on the soil, and then spend your
budget where you can otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just go best lights and then shitty
soil and shitty nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to kind of figure out where to
spread the spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to joke all the time that there
should be a cannabis protective services.
[SPEAKER_02]: People you could call to come and rescue
plants that were essentially being
[SPEAKER_02]: tortured to death by morons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Universally, it was people who loved
cannabis, wanted to produce their own
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, had a huge passion for growing
and not a single fucking clue about how to
[SPEAKER_02]: go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a $600 budget and went to the
grocery store and bought a $580 light and
[SPEAKER_02]: then a $2 watering can and a $3 pot and
said, I got what I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went home, they dug up some soil out
of the backyard, they threw it in the pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: they planted their little plant,
they stuck it under their giant light in a
[SPEAKER_02]: 95 degree garage and shut the door and
called it a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see something like that and you
feel bad for the person because you know
[SPEAKER_02]: they dropped their whole nut on one piece
of gear that's not useful on its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're running that light that's
just going to cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're out the cost of that light
every month extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's money that they could be saving to
buy the two pieces of gear to make that
[SPEAKER_02]: one piece of gear useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ducked fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that time we went to the dude's
house and he had the LED light like 13
[SPEAKER_03]: feet off the ground and that fucking
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, look how much this plant has
grown in the past couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, bro, there's like a foot and a
half between node spacing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing is not growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called stretching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in a pot the size of like a one
liter soda bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like he just cut the top off my
Dr. Pepper bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to make fun of that poor guy,
but if he would have just thought about it
[SPEAKER_03]: and bought the right light or put that
light closer to the plant, he would have
[SPEAKER_03]: much more success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was just right where he was
playing video games.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was at a weed plant next to him playing
video games.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you how many people I've seen
chain smoking cigarettes in their grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room because they heard somewhere that the
plants like extra carbon dioxide and they
[SPEAKER_02]: heard somewhere that carbon dioxide is
something that comes off cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they take two technically true pieces
of information, slam them together in
[SPEAKER_02]: their head in a way that sort of makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the surface and then they can't
figure out why their plants are super
[SPEAKER_02]: sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, uh, cause you're blowing
that toxic smoke at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's not good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hurting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's giving them diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know so many people who's there,
the big problem in their grow turned out
[SPEAKER_02]: to be their dog likes to piss on their
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it happen to three or four
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened to the one fucking dude you're
thinking of like six times, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people are slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learners keep your pets and your
cigarettes out of your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people like to take pictures of
their dogs and their cats in their grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think your animals got bugs bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how clean he is, but he's
covered for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just not in the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some bugs on him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let him in the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I barely let Mike in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a gross, if you're in a
bookstore or at a computer, the first four
[SPEAKER_02]: grow books you see will cover every issue
we've brought up so far, at least enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep you from screwing it up real bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just waiting for you to tie that
around to the dog walking in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waiting for some sort of dog tie
reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things that every grow
book is going to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your fucking dog out of the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still there's dogs in half the grow
rooms in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see them in all the people that post
pictures of their private grow on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever my dog's name is, Bruno likes to
hang out by the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, yeah, Bruno does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's fucking putting bugs and all kinds of
shit on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not being an animal hater,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a medical product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you fucking hippies would.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have your dog buy the food when
you're cooking, but you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's no one thing you can buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do everything with love,
everything with care, the best you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plants start off with potential to
be 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you get in their way and you fuck
them up, you bring them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you give everything you can,
the best you can, they'll come out 100 and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you'll do it better next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I can recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit trying to grow 17 different fucking
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick a strain and grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dial it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lock it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nail it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that one and get it going the right
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of trying to mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have seven girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll never make them happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make one girlfriend really,
really happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great fucking analogy because each
plant is almost, if not exactly as
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated as a girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants different things at different
times for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got a first time grow,
you don't want to be trying to make seven
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of nutrients in like liter
cup sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll go insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wonder why is this OG Kush plant look
totally happy, but this Hayes plant looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you got a Cal Mag deficiency
because those plants want completely
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you got to learn how to mix nutrients
for two sides of the room and you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you on one plant that's trying to be
seven feet tall and one plant that's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to be three and a half feet tall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or one plant that finishes in nine weeks
and one that finishes in seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to figure out how you're going
to, you just got to start flushing over
[SPEAKER_03]: here and cut down half the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that shit just sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick one strain, run the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're an experienced grower,
do whatever the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow 32 strains in one room, make some
flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're new and you're trying to get
shit dialed in, one strain is so much
[SPEAKER_03]: easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I made a lot of sense because we
got real sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't put turbos on an 86 escort and
expect to win races.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was my favorite part of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a really cool email from a guy
who calls himself arachnid death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean that he is the spider that
kills or that he is killed by spiders?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the spider killer?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a spider killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe arachnid death.
[SPEAKER_03]: I expect another email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you the spider killer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Inquiring minds and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you killed by a spider or are you
like, maybe he's... Dude, if it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: second one, you're going to wait for a
while for that email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's Dale Gribble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dale Gribble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rusty Shackleford.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what he was to be called on
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you an exterminator, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the emails.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, first things first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to take a moment and share some
stuff with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently exited the military after eight
years of service.
[SPEAKER_03]: I joined at 24 after being laid off from
what I thought would be the start of my
[SPEAKER_03]: lifetime career.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a year of unemployment during the
economic downturn of 2008, I decided to
[SPEAKER_03]: join the service to provide for my family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before joining, I thoroughly enjoyed
consuming cannabis on the reg.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the four months since my exit,
I've more than enjoyed my reintroduction
[SPEAKER_03]: into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, much has changed in eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs weren't a thing that I'm aware of
back then, at least not in Southern Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say that that was probably an
uncommon thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of pumped that dabs are a thing
in Southern Ohio now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He keeps going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, what advice would you give
someone like me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm eager to try a dab and I have a friend
willing to host me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to expect for my first
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's different for everyone,
but I was hoping you could try and explain
[SPEAKER_03]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how significant it is,
but my friend has a nectar collector set
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm currently only going through a quarter
ounce of cannabis flower, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: assume.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I'm only going through a quarter
ounce every six weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going through a quarter ounce of
flowers every six weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this guy's smoking around a gram a
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a puffer to a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically a one hit and quit each time I
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you recommend that I attempt to up
my tolerance?
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, how?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a stay at home dad now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my smoking really only occurs in the
evenings when I'm not the sole caregiver
[SPEAKER_03]: to a toddler.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been listening for a while to your
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was turned on to your show from the
Dude Grow Show, but I haven't listened to
[SPEAKER_03]: them in months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd share... Oh, another
paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I've got this on multiple pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd share my what I listen to
when I smoke information with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: because if you guys remember on 420,
I asked everybody to tell me what they
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to when they get stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to tell us about his music
interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge fan of music.
[SPEAKER_03]: My tastes have grown to be more eclectic
since high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends and I used to cruise around on
my car and smoke and listen to Slipknot
[SPEAKER_03]: and similar, occasionally pausing for an
in-car mosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the other car in my high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a different car than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were the dead heads in tie dye of
fucking long hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not do the moshing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of... Different sides of the
park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I about spit that all over the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'm sorry if these aren't up to
par.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, you're doing good so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also says, I swear I keep meaning to
listen to Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've heard on your show makes me
think I'd like them overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after my evening smoke sesh,
I like to grab my sketchbook and my
[SPEAKER_03]: headphones and listen to my iry beats
while sketching in my book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love being able to unwind with my pipe
and art and letting the huge changes in my
[SPEAKER_03]: life melt into the background for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a recent episode, you stated that
recreational use is medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was unsure of my opinion until you made
that statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using this flower in any manner that lets
you reduce stress or just generally enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: your life more counts as medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening to a rambling man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for everything you do and stay iry
arachnid death.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's got a PS.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to take a special moment and
thank you for sharing your experience with
[SPEAKER_03]: TBI.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell that sharing like that was
difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it helped.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it helped me realize how seriously
it can affect somebody's psyche.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he states that he's been in the
military and he knows plenty of people
[SPEAKER_03]: with a TBI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super common to people who serve in and
around him, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, first off, we got to say thanks for
your service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your service.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an awesome email, too,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go back through it and hit
some talking points here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've said it before, I'm a dreadlocked
fucking pot smoking hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not into war and shit, but I
appreciate that there are guys that sign
[SPEAKER_03]: up and were willing to go to war so that
you and I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if people didn't sign up,
they would draft motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bro, you're six something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not do well in the military.
[SPEAKER_03]: But your body type.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the nicest thing anyone's
ever said about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like six, four to sixty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The radio takes away 60 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting to be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'd fucking draft your ass and turn
you into a soldier, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be a soldier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also I'm fucking six, five and two
hundred and ten pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be the first guy on Operation Hide
behind him until he gets shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, we'd we'd be the not a good
soldier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be kicked out for fucking smoking
weed would be on purpose to death by the
[SPEAKER_02]: drill sergeant on the second day of boot
camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep calling him, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, why are you yelling at me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you hitting me, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do we're getting disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not do that because this guy's just
I'm so not that's just not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I because it's not me and I know what
that lifestyle would do to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I also know how vital it is
for our way of life, like I just have a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge amount of respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not I never support a war,
but I always support our troops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best way I think I could put
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first thing he says, thank you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks in return.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the thank you message
received.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reintroduction to cannabis after fucking
eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine what an eight year
cannabis break would be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a hell of a tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, what advice would you give
somebody like me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's eager to try a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a friend that'll help him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he doesn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try to explain to him a little bit
about what he's going to get from his
[SPEAKER_03]: first dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he also states that his buddies
got a nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know is this nectar collector,
does it have water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the nectar collectors don't have
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nectar collector, period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water, no water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder to size your hit that way if
you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only set aside a very small part on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the nectar collector, you heat it up
and it just looks like a giant straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got a hopefully a crystal,
a quartz crystal, a glass or a titanium
[SPEAKER_03]: tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three types of tips that I would hit
off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't dab off anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glass, quartz crystal or titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be something else I'm not aware
of, but I don't think I dab off anything
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's got water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope your first dab comes through
an apparatus that has got water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without water, a dab is hot as fuck on
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the experience of a dab is the hit
itself in your body, in your lungs,
[SPEAKER_03]: your physical reaction to that new smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different level of heat than what
you're used to smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vapor is very, very different than a
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it feels like someone's just got
their foot on your chest and you just
[SPEAKER_03]: can't breathe right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only lasts for a couple of few seconds
in my, Jenny Betts says I can't say a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of few anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple could be like, a couple of few
could be anywhere between three to eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a couple of few.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thing, but it only hurts for a
couple of few seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like three to eight seconds, we're going
to say, it just feels like you might die,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I find it pleasant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, but I like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like that scary part of a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a weird guy that eats and say we have
jalapenos and shit for entertainment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend you take a dab smaller than a
piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a very, very small, it's sort of
like, I like to think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a beer drinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've worked yourself up to going out and
having a 40 ounce beer after work,
[SPEAKER_02]: chilling at the bar for an hour,
going home, not intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you switched to hard liquor,
you don't start with the 40 ounce mug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what a lot of people kind of
try to do with their first dab is they end
[SPEAKER_02]: up taking something that's like,
you fill the pint glass with vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their friends let them do it because
they think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, that makes people so not want to
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a grain of rice or half a grain
of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half a grain of rice is probably a big
enough dab for your first try.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got your nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's got water and don't suck so
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the water in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a, give it a test before you even
heat it and start smoking through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that nectar collector up to your mouth
and pull through it and see what that
[SPEAKER_03]: experience is like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel that then have put the little half
grain of rice dab on whatever you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like smoking off of oil slick
pads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like smoking out of silicone
containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put it on glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put my dab on glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only thing I fucking trust for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the other shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to smoke your silicone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to burn shit with my fucking
nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I highly recommend you put it on glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set your little dab on a piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heat up your nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Touch the nectar collector to the dab and
inhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of inhale right before you touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause as soon as it touches, it's going to
vaporize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only want that much smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it should sound like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like seriously, that's probably enough
smoke for your first dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always, you can always smoke more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Ron White told Joe Rogan on a podcast
one time, he goes, boy, you can't un-smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: that joint now, can you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Rogan was talking some fucking
nonsense and Ron White just looked at him
[SPEAKER_03]: like, motherfucker, where are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't un-smoke a dab, but you can
take another one and you're going to want
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fucking take a small one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can take another one instead of
just coughing for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm off track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a little half grain piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heat that motherfucker up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hold it in like you do when you
smoke flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: In and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want to breathe it in,
breathe it out.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to expect for my first
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's different for everyone,
but I was hoping you could try and explain
[SPEAKER_03]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smoke's going to go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to go, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it hits your lungs,
your lungs go, get out, get out,
[SPEAKER_03]: get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your eyes are going to start to water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your face is going to turn red.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to sweat a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to sweat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to, I hope you sweat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of, dab sweats are part of the
fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good dab is like every sweat gland on
your body just threw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a good cleansing feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sweat like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reaching for my shatter while I do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm reaching for water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause just talking about it's making me
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's making me want to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's making me want to dab too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to get this head rush
feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get really super high,
really super fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people kind of panic from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, you sounds like you're a veteran.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a soldier, soldiers through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be fucking just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you said you've got a buddy who's
who's down to, to roll with you through
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just as long as you guys are cool
with each other, get along reasonably
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you sleep on his couch for six hours,
you're not going to have any problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may need a little nap at the end of
all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even us pros every now and again,
we have to hit pause on the show and just
[SPEAKER_02]: chill for 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's been here and halfway into the
show, he gave me the no and went and
[SPEAKER_03]: napped on the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take, take a little half a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get, your throat may burn
from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may shoot a booger out of your nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that shit is part of your first
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the club.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's welcome to the dab club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael fucking cough for 20 minutes and
shoot a booger out of his nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been dabbing for years and I still
cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave James a dab the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy James has got a shaved head.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just shaved his head real close.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gives himself a little buzz cut and
he's got a little beard and he took a dab
[SPEAKER_03]: the other day that I could, it looked like
you were just like his head became a
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking sprinkler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just kept dripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, where's it all coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, boss, man, I'm sweating like a
motherfucker back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so funny watching James sweat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He dabs every day with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dab got him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just moved from one spot to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the middle of the move,
I stopped and took a dab and it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: little big and it was a little hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to change shirts after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want a really hot dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot dabs burn your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot dabs burn turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel a hot dab in your lungs a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff does a hot dab for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes a hot dab because he takes a huge
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the dab isn't hot enough at the
beginning, there's not enough heat there
[SPEAKER_02]: in the middle and end to properly give him
the heat he's trying to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I waste three quarters of what I just
threw in the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you end up Q-tipping it out like
a moron.
[SPEAKER_03]: A humble brag is what I think this might
have been called back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we just told this listener to smoke
is half of a grain of rice for his first
[SPEAKER_03]: dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to leave him short of
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be high from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arachnid death.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get high from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't smoke another one,
if you don't smoke another one,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll start playing games with yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be like, well, a dab hits you
immediately, so you'll know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be like, do I want another one or
not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll know, yes or no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then start playing games with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how much of a dab you can take.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I like to do with the Nectar
Collector, I will make a worm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a long ass, like a fucking three
or four inch worm of hash and lay it on
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever piece of glass I'm using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will smoke the whole fucking thing
with the Nectar Collector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a goddamn ant eater sucking up a line
of ants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I was getting at is, we just told
this guy to smoke a piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dab I just put on this dabber,
that's probably 0.3 of a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably, would you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an adult male's thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say that's like a pointer fingernail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tip it towards me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got big man hands though, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a decent guy's ring fingernail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it a ring fingernail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three or four times thicker than
any fingernail I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to take this dab here in
just a second when Mike's talking,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's not going to ruin me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hopefully not going to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll make my eyes a touch red for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of ties into another piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: He mentions what he's listening to when
he's smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then says he hopes that's up to snuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you read that, the first thing
that hit me was, bro, it's music that you
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only person who gets to decide if it's
up to snuff is you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the dab size, people have this
weird competition thing that they do with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to eat one donut,
I'm going to eat two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hit on one chick,
I'm going to hit on two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to take one dab, I'm going to
take two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't do that with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that with Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana is totally fun until you way
overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just kind of go easy and figure
out where your limits are a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have such a better time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the dude having to call his wife
to come pick his ass up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the cop that had to call 911
because he was too high and thought he was
[SPEAKER_03]: dying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought he was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: People end up... Put a space between those
sentences because we just said the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: that called 911 because he thought he was
dying and then you said it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do not die from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't die from consuming too much
weed, but you can make yourself miserable
[SPEAKER_02]: by consuming too much weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the legalization stage, there was a big
bump in people calling poison control and
[SPEAKER_02]: then showing up at the ERs for just having
way over consumed, not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically with edibles, people fucking
hate... Adults hate reading labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't read labels for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people way over consumed
edibles and ended up in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time they ate edibles in
Colorado or Washington just because they
[SPEAKER_02]: never read the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just take a little dab and see
where you're at, you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at your friend that's a
regular dabber and try to mimic their
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption level, you're going to have a
miserable fucking time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he's going to fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could be like me, I'm a savage and I
love just crossing that threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much everyone I know has a type of
alcoholic beverage that they can't even
[SPEAKER_02]: think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start to say whiskey sour or whatever
it is for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jose Cuervo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their nose starts running a little under
their throat and their tongue starts
[SPEAKER_02]: getting real thick and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone has that because when you
were first learning to consume alcohol,
[SPEAKER_02]: you way over did it with whatever product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can just avoid doing that to
yourself with hash, you don't ever have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the guy that has to, yeah, the first
time I took a dab, I pooped myself and
[SPEAKER_02]: fell asleep on Jerry's couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put too much of a dab in the rig
for myself, so I just tag team buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: passed the leftover dab to Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why he cut out teamwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got a hell of a head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a pretty big dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made sure to save you a little extra.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to do what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn Mike's mic down for just
a minute, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're ready, give me a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was it trying to be rude and kill me,
guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of a bigger dab than Mike
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his thumbs down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just has two thumbs down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do not fuck with my microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask Mike a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can listen, but it's going to be a
minute before he replies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listener says, I smoke one hit each
time and I quit because I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_03]: he's plenty high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we quantify what a dab is going to do
to him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how many hits do you think a dab
equals?
[SPEAKER_03]: If he takes one hit at a time,
how many hits do you think it would take
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to a small dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say three?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just showed me six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So six hits off of your pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to work your way up
to six hits off your pipe to achieve what
[SPEAKER_03]: you get with one dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would almost agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say, yeah, I said five was my first
guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say five or 10 and you gave
me six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just imagine that you're going to
be six times higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you take a dab, you're going to be
six times higher than when you smoke that
[SPEAKER_03]: one hit of weed that you smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't know what kind of weed you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you smoking high grade weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: You smoking Mexican brick weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're smoking Mexican brick weed and
you step up to a dab, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: game fucking changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing to mention, the dabs will ruin
your tolerance for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start regularly- They can for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smoke all the joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got joints, I'll smoke them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like bring them and we'll smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get cotton mouth and I'll get a sore
throat eventually, but I won't get stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll go take a dab and I'll be
high as a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll kick all the joints in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to be really careful with my
hash consumption or I'll ruin flowers for
[SPEAKER_02]: myself for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I fix that with just a quick little
vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to smoke flowers at concerts and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I smoke a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers still my favorite way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flowers in a bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way it all started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowers in a bong, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking flowers in a bong a little
while back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lungs don't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lungs like the bong hit a lot more than
they like the dab hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because I'm a smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lungs have been trained for fuck 20
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we tell this guy to expect coughing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we mention that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just heard Mike cough for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your throat's designed to prevent you from
doing what you're trying to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a cigarette smoker,
if you're a cigarette smoker, it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to increase your coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You notice I don't cough when I dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Elijah, he doesn't cough when he
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike and James, they cough like sons of
bitches when they dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they both, Brian coughs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you guys all smoke
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it because it's not just when I
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I hit a vape of any kind,
even the little oil stick or whatever hash
[SPEAKER_02]: cartridges, when I hit one of those or
nicotine vape or even one of the little
[SPEAKER_02]: electronic cigarettes that you get at the
gas stations, I feel the same pressure or
[SPEAKER_02]: burn or tightness that causes the cough
when I dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the heated liquid vapor versus a
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just jar and loose all your tar lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like water and air going through a
hose.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude asked, would you recommend that
I attempt to up my tolerance?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, how?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not at all recommend that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're a cheap date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can recommend you spend more on dinners
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now it doesn't cost you a lot
to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to conceal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could wear more expensive shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to push your tolerance
further up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start dabbing, it's going to do
it itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't dab too frequently and then just
keep your stash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe only dab when your buddy dabs you
out, which is a dick move.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if you don't buy it,
then you don't have it there to just
[SPEAKER_03]: become a dab head.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not always dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of enjoying the thought of
what it would be like to be able to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'd want to be after a hit or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much cheaper that would be,
how much time I would save that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when I'm dabbing, because I'm a
smoker and my lung can't handle giant
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs, I've got to sit down and take three
or four, which means I've got to heat the
[SPEAKER_02]: nail three or four times, wait for the
dabber to cool three or four times,
[SPEAKER_02]: get distracted three or four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden an hour and a half has
gone by and I've gotten baked once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I could take a puff, be fried,
and be back to doing whatever it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be preferable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I take one giant dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something happens to me when I take one
big gigantic dab that doesn't happen when
[SPEAKER_03]: I take six or seven little tiny dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One big dab really just does it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, with cannabis, there's so
many different ways to consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just playing with the different ones and
finding your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little harder where you are
versus where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I was going to say, that's why I got
a little quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to remember what the fuck I
was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you notice that back in the day when
you smoked and went to work, not to say
[SPEAKER_03]: that we might take dabs and go to work
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't answer this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypothetically, no, you don't have these
jobs anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't fucking work there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fuck those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you worked at places before when you
weren't allowed to smoke, when you walked
[SPEAKER_03]: in there, did you just feel fucking super
high?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're like, I'm not supposed to be
high at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really high suddenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that it's okay to show up for work
medicated so that you're not in pain and
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody judges you and nobody cares,
does it affect your level of high-ness or
[SPEAKER_03]: medication-ness?
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects my anxiety level around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, because I'm in an
environment where I can be honest with my
[SPEAKER_02]: boss that I took this cannabis product or
that cannabis product this morning,
[SPEAKER_02]: work a full shift to do my job as
expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gives a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find myself more concerned with making
sure it's never an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would feel worse being too baked to do
what I needed to do now than I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: at the coat store when I was 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, I'm the boss, so I make sure
not to get fucking blown out baked,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, yeah, I still pay more attention
and I'm like, yeah, they don't get mad at
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know if they know that we're smoking,
nobody's said anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they even do,
but nobody's fucking called us out on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they know that we're all medical
marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work hard and nobody's calling us
out for not having sore knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I make sure not to just be ripped
when I show up or something.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is body intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to do it for eight hours a day,
five days a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I deal with all the contractors and the
city people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't be blown out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to represent our company all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to be bright eyed, white eyed,
mostly ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite is when I've been in a grow
and I'm like balls deep in a project and a
[SPEAKER_03]: contractor rings the doorbell and I answer
the door and I'm like, what's up other
[SPEAKER_03]: human?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen other humans in like seven
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, hey, they just look at
me like I'm fucking a caveman.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was working strictly the retail
side, you don't carry that wonderful odor
[SPEAKER_02]: with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much when you go to lunch, I was
standing at line at fucking subway today
[SPEAKER_02]: and I look up and I look around.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to chill for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm playing with my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look up and I'm getting weird looks from
like seven people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first thing I do is glance down
and I'm like, nope, flies closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smell fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all wondering if I'm too high
to talk or if I work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed up to a restaurant in Colorado
Springs where you order at a window and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you sit down and they bring your food
out to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ordered and we paid and the guy
goes, all right, you'll be sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: outside, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring that right to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fucking snowing, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, no, I'm sitting outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, oh, we really can't have
you guys in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of looked at him and the person
that was with me looked at me like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so do you not like fucking dreadlocks or
what's the fucking problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was the only issue we could
spot like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked the fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's cool here in pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you offended?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got sure I got shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want fucking service.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking I got money in my hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, no, you'll you'll have
to sit outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys reek of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get our money back?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, if we have to sit outside in
the fucking snow, we're not eating here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't appreciate how I earned
my money at my job today, I'm not fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: spending my money here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please give me a full refund for all of
our orders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did not eat at that motherfucking
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear people bitching about the smell and
smelling it on people who work with it
[SPEAKER_02]: while they're in line, like shopping for
groceries or going about their life or
[SPEAKER_02]: taking money to the bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always sort of chuckle and wonder if
people that work in other industries that
[SPEAKER_02]: produce an odor, like if there are people
in their town that like fucking fish
[SPEAKER_02]: market people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure if the fucking the plumber
that smelled like a doo doo walked by,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd be like, God damn, he smells like a
doo doo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived near a town that was famous for
its odor because of a specific industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember anybody being like
motherfucking dog food workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, the dog food plant took all the
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who that worked there,
like no one was pissed at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one was like, man, I was at fucking
Walmart the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude in front of me fucking reeked dog
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even the dog food, it's the... I
can't even describe the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just never, it never came up in
any other aspect of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there are other industries
where because what you're doing produces a
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everyone in your town bitch about
people smelling like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Email me, tweet me.
[SPEAKER_03]: At Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're still listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's still listening at least
because he sent us an email and he gives a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, our bottom line is do not increase
your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay a cheap date.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe sometimes on Friday, take three or
four puffs, see what you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't try to step it up just to step
it up for the sake of stepping it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about your music selections
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a loser.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm totally kidding, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your music selection, like Mike said,
that's all up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit what people think
about my music selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I will listen to on the same car
ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to Fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll listen to Journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll listen to fucking Snoop Dogg
on the same car ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a spot in like my early 20s
where I stopped caring what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to in a way that other people
would consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I was a teenager and I was
bumping to something I knew that I liked
[SPEAKER_02]: that wasn't popular and I'm coming to a
stoplight where other people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to both hear and identify me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd turn that down and just enjoy it
quietly with my windows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we were doing 55 again,
I'd pump it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you listen to whatever the fuck
I'm listening to if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're right next to me, you get to
hear the reggae channel on SiriusXM most
[SPEAKER_03]: of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it makes you happy, turn it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was listening to Joey Diaz's podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncle Joey, The Church of What's Happening
Now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was in traffic near where I live.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a street where traffic is fucked
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally, it takes me 15 minutes to get it
to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left 35 minutes earlier that day and I
was still fucking late.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how the construction and the
traffic are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey Diaz was just cussing up a fucking
storm about something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look over and the little half-tard
with the fucking flag that's waving
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone to slow down is staring at my car
like, what is that guy fucking listening
[SPEAKER_03]: to?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just thought it was because Joey
Diaz will let it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey Diaz will call you a cocksucker and
go off for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to a podcast today and
when it ended, the next one in my queue
[SPEAKER_02]: came up and it was a Kevin Smith and Jason
Muse podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was particularly filthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I let it roll for about half an hour
before it clicked that I was at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe find another podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen to that where you work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We listen to Wheeler Walker Jr. at work
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get back into this dude's email
because we've been recording for an hour
[SPEAKER_03]: and four minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it was a kick-ass email.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to go off on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I'm a huge fan of music.
[SPEAKER_03]: My tastes have grown to be more eclectic
since high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he talks about my friends and I used
to cruise around in my car and smoke and
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to Slipknot and similar,
occasionally pausing for an end-car mosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said earlier, dude, I was a
teenager and I was into Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got into Pantera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dabbled into like the Cannibal Corpse,
Deicide type of shit for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I started heavily smoking
cannabis, my music tastes changed
[SPEAKER_03]: drastically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started the Nine Inch Nails Primus sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to an REM concert and I
thought I was a huge REM fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then- That happened to most people our
age at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was listening to a lot of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You went 311 route as the route Mike went.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first 311 show, I was hooked for life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd listen to The Grateful Dead
sporadically, but my friend Greg
[SPEAKER_03]: introduced me to The Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he took me to a fish show at Red
Rocks and all hell broke loose.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never got into the heavy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is funny, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right before I found 311 and my life
changed forever, the CD that I was most
[SPEAKER_02]: hyped to buy that summer was fucking so
for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You admitted that on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like what you like, yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude says, now he enjoys some rap and
reggae, which is right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he's been listening to the Ivory
Vibes channel, and then he's selected his
[SPEAKER_03]: favorites, which is Revolution,
Stick Figure, Tribal Seeds, and Dirty
[SPEAKER_03]: Heads, which is all exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call that white boy surf dub or surf
reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like more of the Jamaican reggae stuff
most of the time, but if you're listening
[SPEAKER_03]: to Stick Figure and Revolution,
you're already doing it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are up to par.
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep meaning to listen to the Mystic
Roots, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No pressure, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a lot of good stuff,
old stuff and new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Mystic Roots, get yourself a bowl,
fire it up, pull up YouTube and do Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots, pass the marijuana, turn it up,
sit back, close your eyes, and just enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: the next seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That song's probably 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make sure to get it at least once a week
in my list.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then check out some of the newer stuff
with Catherine singing, with Catherine
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramirez on vocals now, because she wasn't
with the band back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they've had some lineup changes over
the years, and Kat sings, and it's a total
[SPEAKER_03]: totally different vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking dig it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go see them live if they come near you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tour a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to keep moving on the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a rambly pair of stoners tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, you mentioned you smoke and grab your
sketchbook.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you draw, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see some of your art.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're kind enough to share,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show me what you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to draw when I was a youngster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I lost my passion for art for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, recreational use is medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that makes you feel better,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure you got some PTSD or
something from being in the military.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure something hurts, and you're a
parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you just need an escape
without even going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still got to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also says, thanks for listening to
Ramblin' Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thanks for the great email,
because you gave us like an hour worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: solid material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for everything you do, and stay
ire, arachnid death, and then I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with the PS.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take a special moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing your experience with
TBI.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could tell sharing like that was
difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it was a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to hide it, but there's a couple
of spots where my voice shakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, do I want to share this much
about myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I felt like I just needed to be as
honest as I could with you, because what's
[SPEAKER_03]: the point of recording a show if you don't
make it honest and real?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did it all from my heart on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, arachnid death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your military
service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for returning to the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Cannabis, we like having you on the
green team, and also thank you for the
[SPEAKER_03]: huge, great email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we gave you some useful advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't increase your intake just to be on
the cool team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go slow with the dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be... That's a mistake that we
made that you can definitely learn from
[SPEAKER_02]: and avoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to think you had to go real hot
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what you're hitting,
what type of tip is on your nectar
[SPEAKER_02]: collector that you're using, or what type
of nail or banger setup you end up seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's glowing, it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it cool a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm going to get some Glow Squad
hate for that, but y'all are nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag Glow Squad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer email.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a good email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got any more questions,
please send them to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I have got a stack of emails on
my desk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't get through all of them in
one episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your email is coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making sure we only get to one email
per show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You add some conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just me talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a good show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made some friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we both needed it getting out and
doing a good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cathartic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun hanging out, not at work,
not on the clock.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, welcome to the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels good to be on a good team again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you see the potential in that
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you've ever been out there
and you're just like, oh, this works well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is well thought out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had that experience all week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel blessed to be on the team now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is the one trimming that weed this
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you're a new guy, we make you
trim for a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's trimming buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us what you think of the trim job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to critique me at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, we should probably
wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been going for an hour and 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, once again, Mike, thanks for coming,
taking time away from the little guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: time away from the wife, time away from
your fucking pack of dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got all kinds of good shit going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it was so nice to get over here
and just do a good show and chill for a
[SPEAKER_02]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, thanks to everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun hanging out with everybody,
giving everybody some grow advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're all friends now.

[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, that was an amazing email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and there are a lot of great emails
in the pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just can't get through them because
Mike talks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of great points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, when I go back and listen to
shows, the ones with listener-generated
[SPEAKER_02]: content where somebody has a specific
question, those tend to be the shows that
[SPEAKER_02]: I find myself really getting into a third
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: A third time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You listen three times?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you listed off all the shit I got
going right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only take fucking Pandora for so
many hours a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I end up going through podcasts,
and I'll burn through an entire run of a
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast in a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm listening to too many shows
because I can't get them all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going 18 hours a day,
there's always something playing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: background.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just burn through a lot of fucked
content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys are enjoying the Thursday
episodes I'm putting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been putting out big old chunks of
Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to get five episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that three, three and a half hour
chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that not fuck up your phone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that not mess up your data?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everything legit with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on Wi-Fi constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never off Wi-Fi long enough for that
to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an iPhone, and I've got the
unlimited plan, so I don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got an offer for the internet company
who used to fuck me with that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel for people who have to deal with
that and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful which episode you download.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Thursday episodes can get long,
but man, I love that big fat chunk of
[SPEAKER_02]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: I save them as a smaller file.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not as high quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the same size file as a short
episode because they're not saved as an
[SPEAKER_03]: enhanced podcast file.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just save them as a shitty MP3.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the start of the show, the original
topic, old shows deep in the playlist,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've covered everything you're going to
find in a grow book two or three different
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like the show and you don't like
reading, you can dig through old episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: and learn everything you need to know to
be a really successful grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've currently got the first 65 episodes
available on my YouTube channel at Grow
[SPEAKER_03]: From Your Heart on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to YouTube and search for Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a playlist of the first 20 that's
borrowed from the iRegenetics YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: channel, which doesn't do shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing up there, but the playlist
is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the other 45 are there on the Grow
From Your Heart channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch the first 60 episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, it's not video of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just screenshots of random shit,
but all of the audio is there,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can listen to every episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say 33 through 36 and 40 to 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up into the 70s, there are a lot of great
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are episodes where we sit down and
the show starts off with get your pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've typed out entire seven or eight
10-page fucking podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get hyper-specific with every step of
the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a series where Jeff brought in
different experts in each little piece and
[SPEAKER_02]: interviewed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just incredible and insanely
informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to get back to that one of these
days when we get more time to... We
[SPEAKER_02]: legalized it and we all got ridiculously
busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got these huge jobs now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind, I'm getting a lot more lights
real soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm building a whole nother facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't fucking wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to be overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overwhelmed is my favorite way to be
lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to overstate it, but we could do a
demolition derby in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same building we were building a grow
in recently hosted a dodgeball tournament,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Roller derby.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was happening in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: There were three or four events in the
building because the grow hasn't been
[SPEAKER_03]: built in there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just taking it over now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The former tenants did a fucking roller
derby thing in there, a dodgeball event.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to fill it with lights pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plans are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much of that shit I'm
supposed to spill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not my business to share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for listening to all that
private information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to edit it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody gives a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, just give me the edit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, this podcast, we're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all friends here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shh, don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a secret.
It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously time to end this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
an hour and 15 minute episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_03]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Mike once again for
joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I am responsible for in
this episode for saying thank you to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everybody that has sent me
emails.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Arachnid Death for
serving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Arachnid Death for the
excellent email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, granny?
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to get together to take dabs soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny and I have been talking about going
somewhere together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may record a podcast there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to talk too much about it
because I just want to let it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, until next time,
take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
