[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 449 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking big, giant dabs of
Tahoe Jam fambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 72.9% THC and 84.4% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the flavor and aroma of the
Tahoe Jam fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Tahoe OG and Jam Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking it open right now to get a
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gross, and it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this diamond that is left in this
container is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one big, fat diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a nice little layer of terp sauce
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to make one delicious dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be my after podcast
reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious Tahoe
[SPEAKER_00]: Jam fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Apothecary Farms
in Denver, Colorado Springs, and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, the Pueblo location.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk a
little bit about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I want to do some
shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big thank you shout
out to Miss Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I said I was
going to talk a little bit about outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too deep into this,
let me make a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a very experienced outdoor
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never been fully in charge of an
outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked in an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved in greenhouse
situations, but I am not the most
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety percent of my grow experience and
history and resume are all from indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very familiar with indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had a few emails requesting
information on outdoor growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I am going to do my best to provide
quality, accurate information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is just about time for our
outdoor plants to begin flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the first question I should
address is when will my outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to flower and why are my outdoor
plants flowering before we have gotten a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12 light cycle outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are right at the end of July,
approaching the very first week of August,
[SPEAKER_00]: so our plants will begin to flower any
time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is strain-specific, it is
cultivar-specific, and it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: location-specific, but it is just about
time for our outdoor cannabis plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a quick talk about when to
expect our outdoor cannabis plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we are talking about outdoors,
we need to keep in mind that seasons are
[SPEAKER_00]: different around the planet, so this will
be based on the North American season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also be more specifically based
on the mountain time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am most familiar with the mountain time
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what happens here weather-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I can speak most about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where most of my information
will be pulled from, is the North American
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're following along in another area,
you may need to adjust your calendar
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will apply to the North American
mountain time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust from where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in North America, most of this
will be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how far east,
west, north, and south you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our outdoor season should begin right
around the 1st of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very plant-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very strain-dependent,
also very phenotype-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also depend on your specific
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get even more specific, your actual
altitude could have a huge difference with
[SPEAKER_00]: how soon your plants begin to flower and
also how soon your plants finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that will contribute to when
your plants begin to flower is how much
[SPEAKER_00]: shade are you getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a shady area or are you in a
really sunny area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your plants getting the maximum amount
of sun they can handle or are they wishing
[SPEAKER_00]: there was more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you in a shaded area and are your
plants achieving their DLI?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are not receiving their
DLI, they may begin to flower because they
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the light has reduced and the
season for flowering has begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing that will decide when your
plants go into flower is that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar's critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical period is what we call the
amount of darkness that plant requires for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to induce its flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant's critical period will be
different indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in just a
moment, but the critical period of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has a lot to do with when that plant
decides to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have learned that most plants we have
bred like a 12-12 light cycle indoors to
[SPEAKER_00]: induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: By experimenting, we have also found
plants that will flower with 14 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness or 11 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of experimenting,
but we have learned that some plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: different critical periods and this just
depends mainly on where the genetics of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be strain specific and it
could also be very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you've got two different
phenotypes of the same strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: one may want to flower earlier,
one may want to flower later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just going to be the phenotypical
expression and that is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical period of each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to figure out the critical
period of each plant we run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that is going to be all based
on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that is based on where those
genetics came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What part of the planet did that genetic
originate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we breed it to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to show?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make our critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of other things that will have an
effect on when our plant will flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: which side of the mountain are you on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we live in Colorado, we think about
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have way lots of sunshine on one
side of the mountain and hardly any
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine on the other side of the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those will flower sooner,
some of those will flower later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some farmers use that as a way to set up a
perpetual crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that this side of the mountain
flowers earlier, this side of the mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant everything at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let nature run its magic and you get a
three week separated perpetual harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that will make an effect is
the altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high up on the mountain are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you down in the valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down in the valley, you may not
get as much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants may flower more early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're up at the top of the mountain,
you're probably getting more potential
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to flower later because
you're not getting that light reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are getting all that sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, hey, we're just going to keep
vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dark time yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biggest determining factor of when
your plants are going to begin their
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase in your outdoor grow is
mainly genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did those plants originate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did those genetics originate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about each parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about each grandparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that will reveal ideas about
when it may begin to flower and also how
[SPEAKER_00]: long it may take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than genetics, the next thing to
think about our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much sun are you getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other stressors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had any severe weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done anything weird to the plants
to cause them any sort of stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things will have small
factors as to when your plants begin to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said earlier, the flowering
season in my area here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: in North America, in the mountain time
zone, most of our plants will begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower right around now through the first
of August, through the second week of
[SPEAKER_00]: August.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start seeing our plants kicking
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is a really helpful tip if you
are a new outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to see the male plants begin
to flower first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very common that those boy plants
take off about a week to 10 days before
[SPEAKER_00]: the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be able to walk through that
field every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start seeing the male plants
making their little balls, you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: those females are about 7 to 10,
maybe 14 days at the most behind to start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while I'm on that rant, make sure you
are watching and calling males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a male plant appear in your
outdoor garden and your intention is not
[SPEAKER_00]: to make seeds, you need to remove all of
the males from your outdoor garden as
[SPEAKER_00]: early as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow one male plant to get away
from you and drop pollen, you will
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate every plant within a certain
radius of that plant, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the plant and how much pollen was
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's okay to make a mistake and mess
up your own crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dickhead thing to do is to make a
mistake and pollinate the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood's crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a legal cannabis world where
many people are growing cannabis outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical reasons, for personal use,
and also for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be the person who forgets to pull a
male plant from their garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinates the entire neighborhood and
ruins people's outdoor garden for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are putting a lot of hours and
a lot of work into a successful outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, just as many hours as you,
if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So respect their garden just as much if
not more than you respect yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to find every male plant in
your outdoor garden and remove it before
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets the opportunity to release pollen
on your crop and the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a really good way to make sure that
you are not running any males outdoors is
[SPEAKER_00]: to run clones, have familiar clones,
but I understand that's not always an
[SPEAKER_00]: option, but make sure your male plants do
not get away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me get my stoned ass back
on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is when you see those male plants
beginning to flower, the female plants of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same strain and similar phenotypes
should be about seven to 10 days behind,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably no more than 14 days behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will start flipping to their
flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why some of our
plants are beginning to flower when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have got more than 14 hours of daylight
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very familiar with our plants
flowering on a 12-12 cycle indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't they do that outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very good reason and a very good
explanation for that phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening is outdoors as the sun
sets, it begins to put off a red spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not known as far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That triggers a hormone in your plant
known as phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome red basically tells the plant,
hey, it's nappy nap time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant starts going, hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just getting that sudden
click and the lights go off and it's dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little trigger from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature says, hey guys, nighttime is
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically mom going, hey guys,
you got to quit playing that video game in
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to brush your teeth and you got to
go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom comes in and flicks the lights and
everybody goes, ah, we got to brush our
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth and go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the sun does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome red, far red, they work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant says, hey guys, it's time to go
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant begins to go to sleep and
you will see the leaves in the plant start
[SPEAKER_00]: to droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shutting down for the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it can begin the flowering
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it can start spitting out big fat
flowers and do the magic that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the simplest way for me to
explain why our plants are flowering when
[SPEAKER_00]: we have got 14 hours of daylight still.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are being triggered by far red light,
which triggers phytochrome red inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, which tells that plant,
hey, it is nappy nap time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I mentioned earlier that sometimes we
may see the leaves of our plants begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: droop at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also see this in your veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see this anytime in your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are drooping and it is a
regular thing, if it's happening after a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain time period every day,
let's say you've got the lights on for 18
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and around 16 hours you start seeing
some light droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that that plant has taken as
much light as it can get for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has met its DLI, its daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't take any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all the light vitamins it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its light meter is filled up and it's
like, hey, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to take any more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts putting itself to sleep for
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes if you consistently see light
or plants beginning to droop at a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: time in the light cycle, they may be
getting their daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be wasting electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be pumping too much light into
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of ways you can solve
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious thing you could do is
reduce the amount of daylight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could turn the lights off an hour
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way that plant can just go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not wasting that electricity on the
light and the HVAC that comes along with
[SPEAKER_00]: the light running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you could do is simply move
that plant further from your light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what type of lights you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the situation, but if it is
possible, remove that plant from the light
[SPEAKER_00]: source, put some distance on it so it's
not getting all those photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those humoles, that'll cool that plant
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make it stop working so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in an outdoor situation and
you were seeing this, the thing you may
[SPEAKER_00]: need is a shade cloth or you may need to
simply drag those plants to the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a little leaf droop and it's
not a plant problem, if you're sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not overwatered, if you're sure
they're not underwatered, it is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly that those plants have met their
daily light integral and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me recap real quick and see if there's
anything I left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what else I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about that it's mainly
genetics that will decide when our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: flower outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about environmental
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher you are, the later you may go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more shade you've got, the earlier you
will go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also talked about the critical
period of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have also talked about phytochrome
red and far red and 14 hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the finishing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our plants are going to be done in
my experience between the first week of
[SPEAKER_00]: October and Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the later flowering things won't
finish until as late as Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants would like to go later than
Halloween, but by then it is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have probably gotten our first snow and
our first frost here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we usually aim for phenotypes and
plants that will finish by Halloween at
[SPEAKER_00]: the absolute latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are usually done by the middle
of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all of August to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all of September to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around the start of October through
the end of October should be harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're running a greenhouse with
supplemental lighting, or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of light depth, your situation
may be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, this is very location
dependent, very plant, very phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: and very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases, we should start
flowering any time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first week of August should be our
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start seeing our boys and girls
any time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully those males have already started
showing you that they're boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go through and pull every
male out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are the supervisor or the boss and
your crew says, we pulled all the males,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is still your job to go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a golf cart, if you've got
to do it by horseback, if you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out there on your feet with your
boots, go make sure that all of the males
[SPEAKER_00]: have been pulled from the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ruin your neighbor's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something you need to be thinking
about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the males out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got those males out of the
grow, it is time to focus on those females
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is flowering season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then depending on the plants you're
working with, you should have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest around October time or on the
start or the end of October, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting down some beautiful outdoor
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my super quick breakdown on when
to expect our outdoor cannabis plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, keep in mind that I'm not the most
experienced outdoor grower, but I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: my best to help my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to shift gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pile of emails here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there would like to send me
an email it goes on to say, but now that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's spring, I've done my research and I'm
ready to start my four plant outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is I'm not sure what's
going to pop up since I've got random
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy is ready to grow his outdoor
garden, but he got some random seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has no idea what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have about 12 seeds,
but only room for four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the best option is for
sprout time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And any early signs of better keepers if
the majority of them are female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything helps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerely, Two Wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say my name if you want on the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said that because I had
unsaid your name a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy, Two Wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some seeds from his friend and he
can't decide how to decide what to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice, and this sounds like I'm trying
to sell you something because I'm a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, but honestly, my advice would be
to ditch those 12 seeds and buy yourself a
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable pack of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely suggest some iry
genetic seeds, but if that's not for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: find some feminized seeds that do work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that gets your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of a strain description,
a flavor profile or something that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: you go ooh and ah, and I would get those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that may take you time and
money and those may not be available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is honestly what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were given to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds could be, who knows where they
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be all hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could all be problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could all be 12 different seeds from
different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have one pure indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one pure haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a plant that's going to
flower in eight weeks and a plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to flower in 17 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have all males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have all hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a big gamble and you're going
to put time and energy and money into this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it properly and I would buy
seeds that you knew what to expect to set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting yourself up for success is a huge
step that many people fail at when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get overzealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get some seeds in the ground
and get growing, but we made a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake by getting the wrong seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you've got these seeds in your
hand and you really want to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest you pass those back to
your friend and say, hey dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for the gesture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff suggested I grow some reliable
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do insist on growing these
seeds, let's talk more about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions which you have asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 12 seeds, only room for four
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got room for four plants and
these seeds were free, I would say plant
[SPEAKER_00]: all 12 and then cull eight of them because
you're going to have 50% males,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means probably six to seven are
going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if these seeds are any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows how many of them will sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just sprout all 12 and see what
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would veg them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going outdoors, they're going
to veg on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll flower on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a hermaphrodite or a boy,
it's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for robust growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for traits you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets bigger, start doing some stem
rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the main part of the stem, the biggest
part, just grab your fingers and rub it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then give it a smell and see what it
smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just got to use what gets your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you've got now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, we would run these plants indoors
one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would find a fino that we like and we
would cull the rest and we would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of the keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, outdoors doesn't give us
that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to figure out what you've
got is to just run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sprout all 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would let them begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I see the males, I would pull
the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't worry about which plants I like
until you get rid of the boys because you
[SPEAKER_00]: will get attached to a plant and it will
be a male and you'll want to be stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, that's not a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get attached to any of them until
they are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know you've got girls,
that's when you can fall in love with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have four left at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you plant 12, maybe two don't
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're down to 10 and then you've got
50-50 chance of boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you five boys,
five girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sway one way, you're down to four
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers game may just work out in
your favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just plant all of them and then
eliminate as many needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what can we look for for the keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of depends on what you want in
your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want more of a head racy thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want more of a body high sort of a
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you can look for leaf size and
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants with the bigger fatter leaves
are going to produce a medicine that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more indica dominant,
more sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you want to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants with the longer skinnier leaves
are probably going to produce a medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: that is more sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get more of a head buzz,
more of a psychedelic sort of a feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a good way to start deciding
which plants are going to work best for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need that indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need that sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that you don't like a really
strong sativa, maybe immediately that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to call a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get rid of those sativa dominant
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to look at is just overall
health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one growing nice and stout?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one growing really robust or is one
struggling?
[SPEAKER_00]: If one's struggling, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at this point, you're definitely down
to four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shouldn't make it too hard to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick is to not get attached to these
plants until they are flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: until you've got a way to see what they
are going to give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall in love too soon before you get
to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's just going to be harder to
minimize when the time does come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're going to have a fun
experience no matter what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope at least one of those seeds is a
real gem so you've got some quality
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you should have some quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if those aren't the greatest seeds,
you will produce some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a great learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I really recommend just ditching
these gift seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds rude as hell,
but they were a gift and they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest you spend a few bucks and
get yourself some quality, reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds and then work with those
in your outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will save yourself a lot of headaches
and a lot of wonders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear me say that a lot on
this podcast in the coming episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something I learned a very long time
ago and it feels like it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to remind myself and other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success in all
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of the distractions and
interruptions, life can get challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to add other obstacles to
our lives and to our grows to make things
[SPEAKER_00]: harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best to set yourself up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the obstacles, get the bullshit out
of the way, make a clear path and head
[SPEAKER_00]: that way and succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else is going to do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is worried about their own
success, so you've got to set yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I want to thank
Two Wheels for the great email here.
