[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think we covered all the news
and advertising here at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way into the pet peeve
section of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I go to a grow space,
when I go to a grow room, when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: scrolling on social media, I will see
something happening in a grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow environment, in a commercial
grow that simply drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what are your grow room pet
peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is something that drives you
crazy about a grow, send that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to my website, irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab that says grow questions or
grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that tab to send me your grow room pet
peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, you will get a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of iry genetics premium seeds at
irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's pet peeve came from a longtime
listener, a longtime supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call themselves Chivo del Norte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their comment says, aloha Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your dedication to the
craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thank you for the longtime
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do notice and appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my pet peeve is when I go into my
friend's grows and I see extension cords
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a bird's nest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't, I just can't when I see
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I ask where the fire extinguisher
and the smoke detector are, they say it is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is nerve wracking when you go
to a grow space and it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: spaghetti all over the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like a jungle of extension
cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a big knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a big fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it just looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some pride in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it look like trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then second of all, you're gonna trip over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tripping hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be carrying a bucket of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be thinking about something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be looking at the plants,
staring at the plants like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna trip over that cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna fall on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you fall, when you trip, you're gonna
pull the fan, pull that whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna fall on some other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna break some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna spill whatever you got in
your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trip hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, all of those extension cords are
fire hazards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a fire risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not over extension cord our grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be very conscious of and aware of
the electricity consumption and how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being distributed and dispersed through
the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you are in an old house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old houses are not designed to run
thousand watt, two, three thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what they should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern homes, they should be able to
handle probably a thousand watt light per
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom, maybe more depending on your
breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check your breaker box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm not qualified to give you
electrical advice, but I am qualified to
[SPEAKER_00]: say clean up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those cords off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna trip over them and they are a
fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great grow room pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a bird's nest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a bag of spaghetti dumped on
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get all of your cords up off the
ground away from where water could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow environment,
when you build the grow, you're required
[SPEAKER_00]: to put all of your light sockets and
receptacles three feet or higher off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got to be three feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your house, if you're gonna plug in
the vacuum, plug in a fan, plug in a
[SPEAKER_00]: light, most of the time you bend over,
the sockets are down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, they're up way
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the event that you do get a bunch of
water in that grow, the water and the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity do not meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Chivo del Norte, that is a
great comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great contribution to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your email, check your spam,
because you, my friend, did get a coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code for a free pack of iRi Genetics
premium seeds from iRiDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that was the pet peeve section
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to work our way into the
email question and answer portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm going to mention my
website, iRiGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that website, there is a row of tabs up
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them says store, one of them says
merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of tabs up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab,
there's a short questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ask, what is the VPD of your grow
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few questions to give me an idea of
how to better answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your grow help question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You will win a coupon code for a free pack
of iRi Genetics premium seeds at iRiDirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question on today's podcast,
of course, came from the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from our friend who wants to be
called inner city buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to, oh, it's inner city buds,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my new friend, inner city
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is a general grow question,
and it says, yo, grow bro, what's up,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what if, and that's a good what
if.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what if a feminized plant went
intersex and pollinated another female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would these seeds be all feminized because
there is technically no male involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: this breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing, how likely would these
seeds be, how likely would these seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: be intersex themselves if the intersex was
caused by stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, is there a way to breed out the
intersex gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there's a lot of stuff going on in
this message to where I just want to back
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I want to really take this one from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, and this is a great question,
but there's a lot to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what if a feminized plant went
intersex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we've got a plant that came from
a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point in the flower,
it shows intersex, which means it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got both male and female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to throw pollen and it can
also receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not mainly what we want in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not ideal, but it is what is
hypothetically happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we've got a femme plant and it
went intersex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it showed intersex and it made
pollen and that pollen pollinated another
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes good sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, would these seeds be all
femme because there is technically no male
[SPEAKER_00]: involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now, technically there is no male
involved, but we have to go back because
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have a hermaphrodite involved
somewhere in the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an intersex plant somewhere in
the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant just didn't turn intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has always been an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just had to give it the right
environment to express that asshole trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way I can describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may have not been any male
involved in the breeding, which very
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly, very possibly true, there was no
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point in this breeding,
there is an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That intersex plant could have came from
either side of that equation, the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor or the pollen receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm talking about the starting
female plant, the plant that came from a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of its parents was intersex or one of
its parents was intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, that intersex trait is in the
lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you bred to it, you put that seed
in the appropriate environment and that
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex trait expressed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is a trait just like aroma,
just like flavor, just like vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like potency, just like pest
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is a trait and it is in your
breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a femme plant, it went intersex,
pollinated another female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got an intersex plant
pollinating a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say a female plant anymore
because that plant is now intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crossed out that female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is a hermaphrodite that has now
pollinated a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would these seeds be all femme?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, these seeds will not be all femme
because they were not made with two female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were made with one hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crossed out that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a female anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get to play female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen both parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get to decide its gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it science, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a hermaphroditic plant that
pollinated a female plant, not a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to correct the whole project
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be updated and corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data is no longer accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now taking a hermaphrodite plant
and pollinating a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, because technically
there's no males.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's a hermaphrodite in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How likely would these seeds be to be
intersex themselves if the intersex was
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: The intersex wasn't caused by stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It presented itself because of the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The propensity, the opportunity for those
seeds to be intersex is 50-50 in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to grow them and find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely wouldn't give any of these
seeds to anybody that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow them myself, grow 100 of them
before I share any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've got to correct in this is it
was not a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not a female to female
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an intersex plant to a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your whole idea of the female to female
not making any male seeds, that is washed
[SPEAKER_00]: out because you're not using the
ingredients that you thought you started
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere along the line, what needs to
happen I'm thinking too many thoughts at
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making feminized seeds,
what needs to happen is every plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: are breeding with needs to be stress
tested and thoroughly vigorously tested
[SPEAKER_00]: for intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant in the room that you're going
to breed with, the pollen donor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen receivers, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of stress testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of selection or a lot of very
special selection through when I do
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't use anything that shows me
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it shows intersex for any reason,
in my room, I avoid breeding with those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do breed with those plants,
I keep them for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't find a reason to even breed
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said something in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way to breed out the intersex
gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just skip that trait altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what needs to happen is better testing
before these plants are bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not have two female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not have a solid female on both
sides because the breeding somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced a hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is showing up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way I can explain this,
I've been trying to find a good way to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the herm trait in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way that I can explain this is if
you use any intersex plants in your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, imagine I'm going to take this a
weird direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine we are making a giant cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a party coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bringing that up is the reason why
we're making a cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: My birthday is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make a gigantic cake,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, we're going to put
the hermaphroditic trait poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to sprinkle some poison in my
birthday cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to stir it all up and
we're going to put it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where that poison went in
the cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the poison could be all at this end of
the cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the poison could be at this end of the
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poison could be sprinkled out a little
bit here and there, or it could be evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out homogenous through the entire
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that poison went.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly how I feel when you're
breeding with intersex traits in your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's poison in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where it's going to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how long it's going to take
to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how much of it got spread
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's all at this end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if all of the poison went to
this end, but we do know that it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do you even want to mess with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any of the cake because I
know there's poison in that cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go somewhere else and get
poison free cake, which would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-intersex plant, which would be a
better bred line from a breeder that paid
[SPEAKER_00]: more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line wasn't tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex traits are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that this wasn't tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science, nature, they get together,
they find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the Jurassic Park theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Bean also calls it the Jurassic Park
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life will find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plant's number one goal,
we like to think, we like to act like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we like to be egotistical and arrogant and
believe that this plant is here to get us
[SPEAKER_00]: high and heal all of our ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not thinking about that at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's number one purpose in life is
to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you and me, it just wants to
reproduce all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it's thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the male plants get taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plants stay lower so you can
drop that pollen onto them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he takes off a little bit
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the number one purpose of that plant
is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to find hermaphroditic
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to happen occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100% preventable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my breeding, what I'm saying is I
thoroughly test my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant that goes into my breeding
program is stress tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some damage to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some light testing, some feed
testing, hot, cold, climate changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run it through the ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a bunch of commercial
facilities where we could really abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got to do it on smaller areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I abuse the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they show me intersex traits,
they don't get bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my feminized seeds are reliable
and we don't see, you don't hear any
[SPEAKER_00]: reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not saying, I rehaz herms
because I'm doing my due diligence and my
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like I don't know who these
seeds came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you got these seeds or
what this hypothetical question derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this breeder, it sounds like that
you're hypothetically creating,
[SPEAKER_00]: may not have done the work, may not have
done the due diligence to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants were not intersex plants
before they went into the breeding room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read the question again because I
got rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got way off topic in my head here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a feminized plant went intersex,
so it's a female plant that came from a
[SPEAKER_00]: fem seed, went intersex, pollinated
another girl, those seeds will not be fems
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was a a herm plant that
pollinated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's another, I'm going to say
that's another one of my freaking pet
[SPEAKER_00]: peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me crazy when people say that a
herm plant will make fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, just like I explained,
there's poison in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed, if one plant tastes like
strawberries and one tastes like chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: and you breed it, you're going to get
chocolate and strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of them is a herm, why wouldn't the
herm pass right along?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's a herm going to make fems?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my major pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, inner city buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please check your email, check your spam
folder because you do have a coupon code
[SPEAKER_00]: for a free pack of iRegenetics premium
seeds.

out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you for listening to a
short, quick episode of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to leave this episode with just
this topic all by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that this one is going to make a
good show by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a week with fresh new
content.
