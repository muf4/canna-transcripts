[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I've been taking dabs of orangutan,
funk, live batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a blend of jelly 13 and grease
monkey on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor is described as orange rinds
and buttery fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I open up this concentrate,
the first thing I smell is a funky orange
[SPEAKER_01]: rind punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of delicious all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it is followed by a gassy,
I want to say kind of armpits and sweat
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of aroma that I honestly really enjoy
that orange and gassy funky thing really
[SPEAKER_01]: gets my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that I smoked this entire gram
of concentrates in just a couple of hours
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought this this evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is gone at recording time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took the last dab as I sat down to
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 65.61% THC and nondetectable
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was delicious concentrate,
amazingly terpy and amazingly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out again to our friends at
green dot labs for the perfect podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, in this episode, I'm going to
focus on Patreon messages.

[SPEAKER_01]: And last but certainly not least,
I want to send a big grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friend Papa Rony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not already supporting the show
on Patreon and you'd like to learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this, simply go to Patreon,
read the list of tiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tiers will get your email
right to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and contribute at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either leave your message or
question in the Patreon message box or you
[SPEAKER_01]: can send it to me via email at grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know you contributed to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will move your message right up to the
top of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from a Patreon contributor
who is known as North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up North?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo, what up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you too, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I came to Pueblo and it was sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was nice at the cannabis connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate a fire ass burger place in town,
but hey, I came home after one week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he came to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you had a good time in my town,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to the Colorado cannabis exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he said connection to Colorado
cannabis exchange is where I think he went
[SPEAKER_01]: because they told me you came by bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And giving me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love knowing that I bring traffic to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they mentioned you came by there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they took good care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where I grabbed the orangutan funk
live batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colorado cannabis exchange at the south
end of Pueblo will always take good care
[SPEAKER_01]: of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you and
then be polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say I sent you, you better be
polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, our friend went to a,
he says a fire ass burger place in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I know which burger place
that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They offer a delicious vegan burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a lot of other great options
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of their French fries and their
dipping sauces are fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you found that spot right in the
middle of downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really glad you enjoyed that good place to
eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the eat from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I'm glad our friend had a good
experience in our town and eight at a
[SPEAKER_01]: place where I eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got the tater tots too,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much good shit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, anyway, I came home after one
week switching into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out and did some trimming and
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of the sudden I got rashes
and hives all over my arms and wherever I
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting touched by the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend went and did some work in
his garden and now he is experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: rashes and hives on his arms and his body
after working with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to know, maybe it's from
something else I did or did my plants all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sudden decide to make themselves
allergic to me because they weren't doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, this is all too common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen this several times working in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who works with a specific
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a cultivator and a trimmer and a
harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Jules, if you're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss you boo.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a badass grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when she works with blue dream,
she will break out in hives.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll start wheezing and fucking
breathing funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is allergic to blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ironically, I know back in the day,
I used to talk trash about blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she broke out in hives from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that extra supported our statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a friend who is allergic to
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen other people break out from
orange dominant turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant really smells orangey,
they'll get little blisters and rashes up
[SPEAKER_01]: and down their arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen certain strains give people like
asthmatic attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, I thought people were faking it
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they would come and trim a bunch
of strains and then we'd give that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: back to them and it would just hit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a couple of options that
could be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: My very first concern is a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you applied a pesticide to these
plants that you were working with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you applied a pesticide yesterday,
maybe several days ago, maybe a while
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that pesticide is still on the
plants and today something in that
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide rubbed up against your arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got just the right combination of
pesticide and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body heat will activate a pesticide
and help you get a rash a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you hit a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're putting on your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not accusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm listing options, trying to make you
aware of anything that could have
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pesticide is my first concern because
now you're getting poisoned with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to treat that properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next option, did you spray a foliar
feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you give it some kind of food that you
applied via a foliar feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the plants are indoor or
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're getting sprayed
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a pesticide or a foliar feed is on
the leaves, on the plants, and it's gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: to your skin and now it is bothering you
and giving you a rash.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next question is, is it a new strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever grown this strain before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains fuck with some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, my friend Jules can't
grow Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other people that other grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't grow citrusy, orangey flavored
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that I see do the most
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hazes, Blue Dream, and citrusy stuff are
the ones that make people have weird
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the strain specific that you are
allergic to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying allergic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next thing I'm working into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's something in the trichomes,
in the leaf oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's just something simply in
that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point of that plant stage of
growth that you were allergic to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your body rubbed up against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, that's a lot of trichomes to be
on my arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of whatever oil is in that
trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are terpenes, palliates,
esters, fucking plant alcohols.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of things happening in
that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's bioactivity happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you're allergic to the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're allergic to a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you were allergic to that specific
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're allergic to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're allergic to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that stage of growth, all of these
things are possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, maybe a bug did something weird in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what kind of pests you've
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a pest did something in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know those options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to keep our minds open and
filter through and make sure I give you
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas of what could have gone on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely it was a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the most obvious thing or a
foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people break out in weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get weird fucking rashes up and down
their arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it comes across the back of their
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen weird shit from pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen crazy shit from pesticide
exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google your symptoms and see if it looks
like pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have applied a pesticide,
open the back of that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a water bottle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a pesticide handy,
but there's a little book right here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just pull that open, it'll have all
kinds of stuff written inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you read that before you applied
the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what the active ingredients are
in that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Google the adverse reactions to
exposure of that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Azadirachtin poisoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Azadirachtin exposure, azadirachtin rash
on skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you applied, I'm just picking
azadirachtin because it's a word that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with and it was fun to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google whatever product you used,
exposure, rash on skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if that's what you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I think you're just allergic to
that strain or to that specific plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if it happens again the next time you
go in there and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend to everybody to wear rubber
gloves for sure when you're growing the
[SPEAKER_01]: six millimeter or thick, are they six
millimeter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're six millimeter or thicker
nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you also want to have long sleeves in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a grow, I know it's hot, it's warm,
but we expose ourselves to all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend has a rash right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wouldn't have gotten a rash on himself
if he had long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, those grow lights will give you some
skin cancer if you're in a grow room all
[SPEAKER_01]: day, every day under thousands of watts of
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend covering up your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, always wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do another full episode on
grow room safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stay focused today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think it's an allergy to either
the plant or a pesticide or a foliar feed,
[SPEAKER_01]: or perhaps there's a bug leaving some
bullshit around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hope that you apply to
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem that it's not the
plants themselves, but that could be the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: North, North Terps, I hope I answered your
question without more info, without more
[SPEAKER_01]: details, without some scientific analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I've got for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, you're allergic to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you're allergic to something in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to decide, is it a pesticide,
a foliar feed, the plants, the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to figure it out is either go
stick your arm in there more and see if
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a different rash or wear some shit
and don't risk the rash again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get it on your face and stuff,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some calamine lotion and maybe some CBD
cream or something, and lots of dabs and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep moving forward because I
do have several Patreon messages that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do promise the folks who contribute on
Patreon that I will answer their messages,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to follow through on all of that,
trying to be a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is another one from North,
North Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, shout out to Rasta Jeff and White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ups to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brother man, one love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently made the switch from Flora to
Reg AGH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you meant to write Reg
AGH, but he switched over to regular
[SPEAKER_01]: general hydro, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mixing according to the sheets,
but my EC is off the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC is off the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're mixing according to the sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting with RO water?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your EC is up higher, maybe your base
has already got a couple hundred PPMs of
[SPEAKER_01]: water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you even add nutrients to your
water, fill up your vessel, your
[SPEAKER_01]: container, your reservoir, whatever you're
putting the water in, stick your meter in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, see what it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many PPMs are in there now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say as a guess, just a
starting number, 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you mix up your nutrients,
deduct 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of more closely to what
you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is shit in there starting,
you need to take into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wondering why the EC is way off,
that is one quick way to figure out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just deduct the starting number from what
you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I recommend as you add each nutrient,
keep that EC meter in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're starting with 20 milliliters per
gallon of base, pour it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what it goes to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the nutrient charts will show
you what that EC will go to at that rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to go high, don't add that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your goal is 600 and it's shooting
right up to 700 with the recommended
[SPEAKER_01]: dosage, don't put that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply just add a little less and just
wait until it gets to 600 and then stop
[SPEAKER_01]: adding the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then whatever the next nutrient is,
probably CalMag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're at 600, you want to put,
and I'm just making up numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't follow my number scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making these up off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have 600 of base nutrients and then it
says 100 PPMs of CalMag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pour in the CalMag until you get to
500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do it that way instead of using the
dosage chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your meter as your measurement and do
it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next thing that I'm concerned with is
are you using the correct unit of
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the nutrients measured in teaspoons,
tablespoons, milliliters?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that measured in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the water measured in gallons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it measured in liters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it measured in British gallons or US
gallons?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make sure to read the container,
the measurement device, the instructions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the website, the mixing chart,
the nutrient calculator, wherever you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting your info, read that and make sure
that you are using the correct unit of
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using gallons of water or liters
of water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the nutrients you're adding,
are you using milliliters, ounces,
[SPEAKER_01]: teaspoons, tablespoons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you are getting those two
things correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of those is off, if you think
you're using liters and you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons, you're way off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're using milliliters and
you're using teaspoons or tablespoons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are way off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got both of those fucked up,
you might just get right and be perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't sound like you've done
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're using the correct unit of
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, RO water, correct unit of
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the plants happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're mixing it up to the
recommended dosages, how are the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: acting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they telling you, hey, I'm angry,
I need more nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they saying, hey, I've had way too
much fucking nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that you're checking your
EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to know what you mean by off
the charts because I go a little bit high
[SPEAKER_01]: when it goes to EC and PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's the other thing I was trying
to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your meter properly calibrated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Test it to other meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that that thing is reading the
same as other meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a friend with another EC or
PPM meter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you go to the grow store and test it
to one of theirs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Find somebody else with another meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your meter is accurate
because just like mixing your nutrients in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong size of proportions to water to
milliliters or whatever we're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: if your meter is wrong, your meter is
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to get it dialed in
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using RO water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Deduct the amount of starting PPMs or EC
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using the correct unit of
measurement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your measuring device dialed in and are
the plants happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important part of the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you getting your information?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it coming from the website,
the bottles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it inside the box?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then verify that you've read that
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep moving because I can get
quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into the next message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got too many from North Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, North, but I'm not going to
read three of your messages back to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump in and help out our friend,
OG Purple Thumb with the great message
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I have an IPM
question for you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever used Pyganic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we use Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fucking stumble all over that one,
but we still use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Pyganic in a commercial environment
quite regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is part of the rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer Evergreen, but Pyganic is
basically the same product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our distributor gives us Evergreen
for a better price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why we've chosen the Evergreen
over the Pyganic, but we do use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't quote me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your own research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approximately 15 to 30 milliliters per
gallon of water in a tank mix with other
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, I also believe you said you
use Botanogard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I use Botanogard Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we use that one somewhere around
15 to 45 milliliters per gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what else we're mixing it
with and the pest we're trying to attack
[SPEAKER_01]: and also size of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not quote me and do not risk your
plants on my dilution levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you test on your garden first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the fucking manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow all of the instructions on
[SPEAKER_01]: a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be very careful when you're applying
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the fucking manuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear all of the proper protective personal
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear some goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear gloves, long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear good shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a shower right after if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then consider that everywhere that you've
sprayed is now a contaminated pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sprayed in a room, that wall,
that light, that doorknob, it's all coated
[SPEAKER_01]: in pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that shit in mind the next time you
go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you're not spraying today
doesn't mean there's not pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: available for you to come into contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on to a good rant just like I thought
I would be after those dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use Botanogard Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use the Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about another
pesticide here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says both have pyrethrum, but I see
Botanogard has BB also.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you recommend for a soil mite
knockdown?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are way too many for my liking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're having a great weekend,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got soil mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure they are soil mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you verified that they are soil
mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the first course of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Verify that we are battling the right
enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the wrong bug, the wrong
enemy, you may be treating for the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never get rid of your cancer if you
keep treating for the flu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you also have regular fucking eat your
plant spider mice that are going up and
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're probably going to have both
if you've got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's talk about ways to get rid of
these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've mentioned Pyganic and Botanogard
Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like venerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are three great products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with the venerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it give people pesticide
problems, rashes and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most toxic one I think I've
used in my commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that I've seen the most problems,
the most outcome from people not using
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how are we going to get rid of your
soil mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to mix up a pesticide,
in my opinion, in my experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my professional case, this is what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would mix a pesticide into my watering
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you water from, if you got a big
trash can that you mix your nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: water into, fill that bitch up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put the recommended dosage of
whatever pesticide you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use Botanogard or you can use
venerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will all eradicate the pest you were
trying to get rid of if it's a soil mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've probably got
Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do Pyganic on the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill up your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the Pyganic in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water your plants to run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get at least 10% to 20%
runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want water coming out of the bottoms
of the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tells us we have soaked all of the
surface area of that soil or soilless mix
[SPEAKER_01]: or cocoa, whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe 15 or 20 mils of Pyganic in a
fucking big vat of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then water the plants to run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then give it two or three days and wait
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bugs are going to die slowly,
but give them time to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you were in veg, I would go ahead
and apply a sprayed pesticide application
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bugs are going to go, shit,
we're getting bombed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting destroyed down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to try to run up into the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got one type of mite,
there's a good chance you've got another
[SPEAKER_01]: pest in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not treat for everything while we're
at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So spray a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray the Pyganic at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix up 15, maybe 20 mils per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's watch for three days and see
what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the bugs gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to mix up another batch of
pesticides and we're going to dredge that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil one more time to see if anything
climbs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give the pots a smack.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if anything comes climbing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any little fungus gnats flying
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see soil mites come climbing up the
stem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they run out of the sides of the pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a fabric pot, pull the
fabric pot away from the medium and look
[SPEAKER_01]: down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there shit moving?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a bunch of mites run out of that run
out water, the runoff water when you
[SPEAKER_01]: watered 20% extra?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see little carcasses?
[SPEAKER_01]: They reflect in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you shine a light on it, the little
reflective dots, dead bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working towards your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time it's time to water,
you can mix your nutrients into this batch
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you don't want to put nutrients in
it, don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would use a different pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use the Pyganic last time,
this time let's use Botanigard Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give them a right fucking right hook
last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send them a fucking left one right
to the fucking jaw this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to hit them with two rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the right's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They felt the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give them a left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give them Botanigard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got a one, two punch three days
apart from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kapow, kapow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't fucking get used to that many
pesticides that quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've given them Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've given them Botanigard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's inspect again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let the soil dry up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if we see anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see any signs of bugs, let's do it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's also spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may do the Pyganic again next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would also spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the option.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got Pyganic and Botanigard,
spray either one of those that you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary if you still see a pest problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to hit it first time with
Pyganic in a soil dredge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to let that dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to check for the presence of
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do it again with or without the
presence of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switch the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the plants recovered well from
the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll get a little pissy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've been getting attacked and you
overdid it with the pesticide,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll get a little angry at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got to get rid of the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they recovered well, let's do it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's also maybe consider spraying at
the first time, the second time,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the third time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first time, we're going to do a dredge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check for bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then dredge again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any bugs, dredge and spray again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you've still got bugs,
we've got to step up our game.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get venerate or a stronger
pesticide in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe consider releasing some predators
that will get in there and attack a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would start off with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drench them, spray them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then drench them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then drench and spray again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then reassess the situation and hope we
have successfully eradicated all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be the guy that puts a
layer of diatomaceous earth across the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of your soil, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it when the soil is kind of dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get that shit too wet too soon
because it only works when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it takes a lot of time and it's
not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb
for the great question on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it moving because I am fucking
chatty and we have got a lot of Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they sign their name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from Super Lemonade 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you popping up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message, sorry for all the paper
noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am using the lapel mic again and you're
going to catch a lot of extra noises.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my paper sticking to the sticky
dab mat here at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm a real person over here doing a
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this question makes it, you can use my
name on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm glad you said that because I
already done used your name on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I just got set up on yours and on
Mike's Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike, thanks you for supporting him on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give Mike a shout out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have listened to the show and
you've heard my good buddy White Mike on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show and you would like to support his
Patreon, visit him at patreon.com forward
[SPEAKER_01]: slash White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him some support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him some love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let him know Ross to Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does deserve all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I was wondering if you could do
an episode on the TMNT line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to YouTube and you go to my
playlist, go to the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a list of playlists.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look on the playlist, there is a
playlist called strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of that playlist, it says six
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the TMNT episode where I described
the original six that I released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not put shredder in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was not released at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should do an episode on shredder,
but there is a full episode on the TMNT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, maybe you could spend more
time on the blue raspberry truffle as it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must make a correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue raspberry truffle is not the
pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry cookies is the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of options, a lot of
offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue raspberry truffle is blueberry
cookies to arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's its own cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry cookies is its own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the one I reversed to make the
TMNT line, to make the Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's more to that that I am
missing in the name description.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't prepared to say that out loud,
didn't research that, didn't write it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One minor correction there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the blueberry cookies is the one
that I used to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make that the one that I reversed,
I'll talk briefly about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry cookies smells, it's got this
blueberry and cookies aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl Scout cookies has a peppery,
minty sort of aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes through and then it's mixed
with that sweet blueberry candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always describe the flavor often as when
we were younger, there were blue lollipops
[SPEAKER_01]: that would make my mouth and my tongue
completely blue and they were blue
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry and they may have had gum in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always got rid of the gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into that, but they taste,
the buds taste and smell like that
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the blue raspberry name came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got the blue raspberry
truffle name out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows kind of tall, but it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes big giant fucking colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very photogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got big fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of nutrients, but that's
the blueberry cookies that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be using that in a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the blue pill, which will have a new
name soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name is in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't released it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue pill, by the way, is the
blueberry cookies crossed to the golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put a lot of hype around that one
that will be released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got to make a lot more because I
know it's going to go too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tahoe and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry Tahoe and thin mint cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I got that correct coming off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep going though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says as I grabbed the whole,
I grabbed the S ones and I wanted to try
[SPEAKER_01]: it in its purest form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the blueberry cookies
that you've got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got the blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make you clear that that's what
you've got is blueberry cookies S1 and not
[SPEAKER_01]: blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry cookies is feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue raspberry truffle is a non femme.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say shout out to the dude
grows crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I found your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out to the dude grows crew,
the dude grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not listening to the dude grows
show, I highly recommend you check out
[SPEAKER_01]: their show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably popping up on the side of
the screen right here and recommended
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll enjoy their show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoy my show, they're probably
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys right on the side, scroll down a
couple of videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them if they're not already
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Scotty, the dude and guru,
everybody behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big love to the whole DGC gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I plan to make it to the DGC cup
next year as this year's cup is looking
[SPEAKER_01]: less and less likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to be safe and responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked a couple of times about what
we can do and the word responsibility
[SPEAKER_01]: comes up every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be very irresponsible of us to
throw an event where people come together
[SPEAKER_01]: and we all put our mouth on a device.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all share the same smoking apparatus
and pass it around the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one person in there has COVID and
everybody gets COVID, one other person
[SPEAKER_01]: gets COVID and we threw that event,
it is our fault that more people are sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say we.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am part of the event, a small part of
the event, but I've been a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings and the Google docs and the email
chains and we've decided to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible and think about the community
and not just ourselves in the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's time, it will be time and
everybody will know that the dude grows
[SPEAKER_01]: cup will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was as excited as yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good time for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set up a booth in the back of the event
and I get to see all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody comes to me and says,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get showered in gifts and high fives and
hugs and praise and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just my all my friends are there and
they all come to my booth because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck and I've got a big sign that says,
I am here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trust me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss that event as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my boys for throwing an
amazing party every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I had tickets, but you know,
COVID and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, COVID and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to burning one down
and doing some dads with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flowering my whole pack of lemon
Jeffrey night right now and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing the word phenomenal when
people talk about my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big salute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't go wrong there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to smoke them and they will and
they will more likely be my entry for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cup next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I was supposed to say
that, but it sounds like super lemonade is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to put some lemon Jeffrey in the DGC
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys better bring the fucking heat
because that lemon Jeffrey is a winner
[SPEAKER_01]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super lemonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an episode about the TMNT line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a correction about the blue
raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking look forward to seeing you at
the next event, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people tell me they're like,
Hey bro, I was at this event and I saw you
[SPEAKER_01]: and you looked busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not busy just because I'm talking to
people, high fiving people, selling seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing high fives, handshakes, hugs,
fist bumps, just run in my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I am there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am busy waiting for you to come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super lemonade and everybody else,
when you were at the DGC cup or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: event where you see me, come say what's
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's at like comedy works or
something after a show, if it's at a
[SPEAKER_01]: concert, if it's at a concert,
make sure you come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If fish is playing, don't talk to me,
wait till they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then come say hi at a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk over the comedy show,
but absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see me on the street in Denver,
in Colorado, and you're polite,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what's up, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I got a date with me, be polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what's up, Ross and Jeff love what you
do and high five me and keep moving,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love meeting the people, interacting,
getting handshakes, getting high fives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, I've got a pack of seeds in my
back pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say, what's up, Ross and Jeff love
the show, you just may get a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a stranger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got dreadlocks to my fucking knee
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are kind of long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people tell me that I can be
intimidating, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm skinny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably dad the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super lemonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to meeting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also look forward to meeting everybody
else at the DGC or whatever the next event
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I should wrap it up,
but I feel like I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do one more episode North.
[SPEAKER_01]: You snuck a lot of episodes in here or a
lot of emails in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to North North Terps for his
tenacity on getting a bunch of messages
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, however, comes from our friend
Carl, AKA C-dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not have been supposed to say
Carl, but shout out to our buddy C-dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, nobody knows who you are,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I said your name, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not tell him your address yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl lives at 123 High Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bother Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent a great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, a quick note to tell you how much
I enjoyed the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Michigan voters passed the
recreational cannabis act a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, I'd gone 40 years without
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am 41 years old and I couldn't imagine
going that long without smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been consuming cannabis for more than
half of my life and I see no end in sight,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I sampled some northern lights
from my first grow and I found myself in a
[SPEAKER_01]: galaxy far, far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like we got a Star Wars fan here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the team, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am into my fifth grow now and I have my
first real outdoor grow going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strains I've grown so far have been
hardy to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pulled about every dumb trick in
the book and yet my plants managed to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive and take my ineptness in stride.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are very resilient and that
is the best way to learn, is to go fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants up.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think I'm some grow guru.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, since you used a Star Wars
reference in here, they think I'm grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Yoda or something or a grow Jedi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you become a grow Jedi is you do a
lot of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just do it a lot and you have to make
a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how I know that you shouldn't
do this and this to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I did that and that and the plants
died or they had a bad outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: My harvest wasn't as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My potency wasn't desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it didn't taste as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what happens if I do this to the
plant and then you do it and a week later
[SPEAKER_01]: you go, I fucking did some dumb shit to my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plants are teaching you and you're
learning from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you're getting a very good
reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having a satisfying harvest,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue with the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I appreciate your technical
advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be educational and informative
without being too technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people that use too many glossary
terms and buzzwords and shit, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to look smart and they're doing it
for their ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to grow the best cannabis
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why this should be some
elitist club.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should all be growing the best ganja on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you think that my advice is
technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says more importantly, I appreciate
your attitude, your ability to communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: and your willingness to admit that you're
learning as are the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an ever evolving industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are in your fifth grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably on my 500th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just being a guesser here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the technology, the equipment,
the demands, the desires, the strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: the science, it evolves every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how many grows I get under my
belt, science will be ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other grower, some 19 year old dude
on Instagram will be out there discovering
[SPEAKER_01]: some brand new shit that's going to blow
my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm not open to it, I limit myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't be the best grower that I can
be if I'm not open minded and ready to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to learn more shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a student just like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be a black belt, but I want my
second and third degree black belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be doing head kicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do jump spinning, flying head
kicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I always want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be next level in almost
everything I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still learning every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a passionately curious person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to learn something every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that you find my attitude
commendable.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to stay positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to stay OB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I wouldn't come on here and
record if I was in a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would come in like fucking today sucks
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have that all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be the other side of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have fucking some life threatening
disease right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of dollars in the bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a damn internet connection and a
computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to remember that there are people
that have way less than I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a clean bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That keeps my attitude positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that I've created something for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when I hate to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to die one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like saying I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I won't be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it happen to other friends of
ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pass, my work will survive and
outlive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be iry genetics strains being
grown for years and years after I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've developed lost my train of thought
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've developed something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've created something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me fucking filled with
happiness and gratitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've created something that you
know will outlive you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also I've got a child and things like
that, but I'm trying to stay business
[SPEAKER_01]: minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk too much about my family on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the grow from your family
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my daughter will outlive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my fucking brand will outlive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to put that energy into the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My ability to communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think communicating is very important,
especially oral communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think I'm sort of a cannabis
historian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been witnessing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have a story of what they
heard, what they think they know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what somebody told them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado had a huge cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved in a large part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike was a large part of getting things
legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike was a big part of our local
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a part of the first dispensary
here in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been involved in a lot of dispensary
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been to court cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone to city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone to city hall hearings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think communication is very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep losing my train of thought because
I'm so excited about this subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Communication is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think communicating the history of
cannabis is also important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of a historian in that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm documenting the actual history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to communicate that clearly and
accurately is very important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, strain information is very important
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're calling it medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to call it medical
marijuana, we need documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need accurate, accurate information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big stickler for accurate
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pretty laid back dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to cannabis history and
details, I will chime in and correct some
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you like my ability to
communicate as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my willingness to admit that I'm
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, I'm never going to stop
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the technology, the equipment
and everything keeps evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love going to a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some owner is like, yeah, we've got
millions of dollars of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, cool, I've never seen any of
this shit before.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes out tomorrow and you guys
already have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's learn how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when new people come in, I get to be
like, hey, have you seen the new XP 9,000
[SPEAKER_01]: PRJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, I heard they're
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, watch this, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It links up to my phone and I can do all
this cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make the lights come on and the
sprinklers come on and the lights go off
[SPEAKER_01]: and then fucking something cycles over
here and the dehumidifier comes on and
[SPEAKER_01]: they go, you did that all with your phone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, bro, I learned it like
four hours yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get to train new people on new
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know all the advanced shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeps me excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a very great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a compliment and a couple of
rambles, but this one paragraph here got
[SPEAKER_01]: me on a good chant, a good rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes on to say, without being
preachy, every morning I visit my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a little more in touch with a
creator God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're not feeling preachy,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you're more in touch with
whatever created you because of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, feel that, embrace that,
love that, give thanks to it, acknowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: it, feel that throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just have that feeling when you're
in there with the plants, have that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling in your heart, in your mind,
in your body, from your toes to your head
[SPEAKER_01]: all day, every day, you can feel that,
take that with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a commercial grow, it's very sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very robotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very fucking processy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do take some time to touch the
plants, feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do what I call is the growers gaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll catch me occasionally standing at
the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm done, everything is swept up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could leave if we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead, I'm just standing there at
the door, staring off into the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking, looking at the canopy,
looking at the leaves, looking at the fans
[SPEAKER_01]: blow through, looking at the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I notice things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when I'm just enjoying the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I notice that air conditioner is
dripping, that dehumidifier is making a
[SPEAKER_01]: funny noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm doing that growers gaze,
that's when I notice a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll catch me just staring off into
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's feeling the feeling that you're
talking about, that connection,
[SPEAKER_01]: that oneness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same feeling I get when I go out
into nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to get that same feeling in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go out into nature and you feel
trees all around you, you get that hippie
[SPEAKER_01]: dippy connection feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something real to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not being preachy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embrace that feeling, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that with you all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to spread that vibe to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll give you that positive attitude
that you were talking about that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from all the plants, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the trees, all the nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get to come home and love on my
personal garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a very small personal grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to love each one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day I get to touch them,
defoliate them, smell each leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: rub the stems, smell the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mix up my nutrients and smell the
nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to enjoy every moment of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very Zen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very meditative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you smoke that product,
you get that meditative Zen feeling all
[SPEAKER_01]: over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you close your eyes and play little
drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that connection with whatever you
believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a Rasta flag behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I believe in the most died jaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you believe in, love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embrace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it with you all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next line is keep up the very good
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings to you and your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they sign it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, aka C-dub.
