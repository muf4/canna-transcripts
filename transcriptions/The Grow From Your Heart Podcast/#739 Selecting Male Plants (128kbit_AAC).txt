[SPEAKER_01]: That way we can get everybody right back
on track in the discord community.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more thing I should talk about
before we get to the main topic of today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am recording during a crazy thunder and
lightning storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started right as I decided to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was raining a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit record and then we got some major
thunder and lightning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you hear some chaos in the
background it is not World War 3 to the
[SPEAKER_01]: best of my knowledge out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute since I looked outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you hear some noise it is just a
major thunderstorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy that thunderous sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is powerful shook the whole house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll clip that part out where I
almost shit my pants during the thunder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway if you hear some noise that's
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did mention I took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked some live batter of the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grower in Denver who does not want to be
mentioned because you guys will bother him
[SPEAKER_01]: and harass him for too much product.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grower in Denver grew the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the test growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got to grow the machine before a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found a great phenotype that smells
like skunk ass covered in gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes a amazing BHO rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: BHO batter out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke that stuff I get a little
silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I get these blinders on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's like tunnel vision or
the things they put on the horses so the
[SPEAKER_01]: horse can't look to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just stays focused on the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that happens to me when I
smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does not want to shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work on the machine bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found a great phenotype and it fucking
it extracts it processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns into great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main topic there was it's fucking
storming outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second part of that was I'm high off
the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I said I was going to talk about male
plants in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some thunder and lightning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys can hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you may not realize or may not
know that not only am I the host of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow from your heart podcast I am also the
head breeder the sole proprietor of I read
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make regular feminized and regular
seeds are all photo periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not make any auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a collaboration happening with
myself and Daz from night owl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on a auto flower project
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently I do not offer that that is
coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said before I won't make autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Daz stepped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to make some autos for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to help do some selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am I read genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 90 percent me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the dude for the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some helpers that do a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of that is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about seed breeding and
selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: His success is based on the male plants
which I have chosen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of work with a golden goat
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not create the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was given the golden goat the plant as a
gift from a friend that I used to call
[SPEAKER_01]: pineapple express.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my dude pineapple
express.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me the clone of golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to be 2007 maybe 2008 maybe 2009 at
the latest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The memory is a little hazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't write it down just trying to pull
it out of my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 2008 2009 when I got that
golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some reversal breeding with the
golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I reversed the golden goat using a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a female plant but I used it as a
pollen donor which is technically the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I'm doing with the male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I did with that reversed golden
goat was magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything it pollinated was gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I took the gold took the I said took.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I took the golden goat and I
pollinated that with the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made my own cross called a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made my own arise as one out of that
batch of arise as one seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a male in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's everything I could ask for in a male
plant that I was looking for at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that arise male plant got he's got his
own name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an arise F1 plant but he's got his
own name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So King Solomon has pollinated hundreds of
other female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand culture you'll
understand why I chose the name Solomon
[SPEAKER_01]: for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But King Solomon is a lot of what makes my
company successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know me for my know my company for
my arise male people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for things if I say I pollinated this
plant with Solomon like I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Solomon is a very sought after male a
very reliable male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about what makes a reliable
sought after male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I'm a breeder I do a lot of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about my success with King
Solomon my successful male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about selecting a male plant
for your breeding and traits that we would
[SPEAKER_01]: be looking for and traits that would be
desirable and how I do a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all it's all about your goal
and your desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to do as a breeder as
a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you working with female plants that
you want to improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an aroma a flavor an effect
that you are specifically looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have physical or mental or
other types of ailments which they are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cure or mitigate or really find
relief from with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we found that this plant
does a lot of good things and this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: does a lot of good things but this plant's
missing something and this one's missing
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we breed them together we can put
the aroma and flavor from this one and the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get the headache relief from this
one and the body relief from this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may work perfect for some patients for
a specific person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you're breeding for a specific
person's medicine to treat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're breeding for your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're breeding just because you got
this cool idea that if you cross plant A
[SPEAKER_01]: with cross plant B plant C is going to be
fucking stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you breeding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also are you breeding for your personal
selection for your personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something a passion that you're
trying to do or do you plan on doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: on a commercial level putting seeds out
for retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of most of anything in life if you
want to be successful here I go get an all
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set yourself up for success from the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way when you get to the end you're
happy with the outcome you got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have to make all kinds of side
paths and do all kinds of weird work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set yourself up for success from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about a good goal with a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you breeding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you what are you intending to
achieve with the cross or crosses that you
[SPEAKER_01]: make from this male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you're trying to make I'm
going to pick random foods here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're trying to make lasagna and cake
we need completely different ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm making lasagna and I show up with
ingredients for cake we can't make a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful cake or the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure I went with that but you
get what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have the right shit the goal
will never be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal will never be reached.
[SPEAKER_01]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to make a short squatty
plant that flowers early a tall skinny
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant will not be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the male plant that is short and
squatty and flowers early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about that goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's all about what am I trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I trying to fix or create or
what's my final destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to pick a male plant that
will get you to your final destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the desired shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first things we can see in
plants is leaf shape and plant structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: By looking at leaf shape we can kind of
get an idea of a lot more of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the leaves are long and skinny that
plant's probably going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get kind of lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a little bit of time to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the leaves are real wide and you can
camp out under them and make shade with
[SPEAKER_01]: them that plant most likely will stay
short and stocky and it will finish a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course there are anomalies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG cushions make those big leaves and
then they take a little while to flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be things in between
there but the leaf shape will give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: hint of what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of leaf shape are you looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if you're breeding I hope you've
grown a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're breeding you know what kind of
plants you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what leaf shape you're interested
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of leaf shape are you looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what kind of plant structure are you
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super tall and skinny and lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants I breed seem to kind of fall
that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make tall skinny lanky plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stuff I breed will be shorter
and squattier but it just depends on what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like plants that can get kind of bigger
because a lot of my stuff ends up in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like plants that grow really tall and
make big giant top colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some breeders want stuff that stays
shorter and squattier because their
[SPEAKER_01]: environment or their customers are growing
in shorter squattier environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about the desired goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the shape and structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the height.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants are going to get too tall
many people can't grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to get too wide many
people can't grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find a male plant that offers the
structure which you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The width.
[SPEAKER_01]: The height.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that stuff matters but also veg
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they veg quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they real slow to veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cut clones do the clones root
well because you're going to want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: this male plant around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make crosses with it and it's
successful the next thing you want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is make more crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be able to clone this
male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That trait will also pass to the offspring
that clone ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do they veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they grow well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they handle stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they handle problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is the flower time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't get the opportunity
to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower out a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only get to let it go long enough to
see that it's a male and then we cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a space dedicated to male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put multiple multiple male plants in
a room and flower them all out at one time
[SPEAKER_01]: and see who does the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like we do a female hunt for female
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your plants isolate the males take
notes number them plant one plant two and
[SPEAKER_01]: then take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant number one is doing this plant
number two is doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can visually see most of the things
you want to see as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've gotten the eye you can see
like oh that's the one you'll start
[SPEAKER_01]: noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start paying attention to flower time
when you put the plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it react.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it go into flower quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it take a while to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it skyrocket and stretch the minute
you put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is that stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants stretch for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants stretch for four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what kind of genetics
you've got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a male plant that has the acceptable
amount and time frame of stretch which you
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking for because that's going to
translate heavily into your offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about pollen time and
pollen production.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making seeds we obviously need
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take for that male plant
to start producing viable pollen and
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of it to make it worth pollinating
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are really stingy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some they'll start putting out pollen
really soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to find the one that produces
at the time you want and the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen which you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I like in a male plant is a big
fat top cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just tells me that it's going to send
fat tops to its offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get a male plant that produces
a lot of fat tops that's always a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those big fat tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those male plants give me a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does the top cola look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it shaped?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many colas does it have?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it branch up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it all one big top cola or a bunch of
colas that reach up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you looking for the offspring to
do because that is going to translate
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily into the progeny of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how does the male plant handle drought
stress, flood stress, nutrient stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stress these plants out and see
what they do under pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they handle problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they take problems and stress well
because that is going to translate heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: into the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the opportunity to put these
male plants in an environment in which you
[SPEAKER_01]: know is prone to get powdery mildew,
throw those plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they get PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how they react to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, definitely breed with those
male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want those males that give you
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that resistance and health and
vigor will come from your male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stress them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them cold stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them overwatering stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they peter out and just fall apart and
die on you, don't fuck with that male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that dude in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole entire goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of our goals, a very important
goal should be to improve upon the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're taking plant A and plant B and
breeding them, we need it to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect and hope it to come out
better than plants A and B.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need plants C to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then we're just going back in the
line of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not improving on it some way,
you're not doing the plant any service.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing yourself justice as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the hardest things is to admit and
realize that you just made a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that are mediocre.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting off track.
[SPEAKER_01]: But think about plant stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about stressing these plants out and
see how they react before we breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if you put that male plant in
an area that gets powdery mildew all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and this male plant doesn't get it,
that is a great candidate for pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: chucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go from their color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your male plant put out color?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will find male plants that
as they start to fade, here's why we got
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow them out like eight, nine,
maybe even 10 weeks of flower on a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if it starts changing colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get yellows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get purples?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get oranges?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll put out those real
pretty red colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants that put out those colors
will pass that trade along to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to that trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your male plant putting out trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: If that bad dog is putting out trichomes,
then it will definitely pass on potency as
[SPEAKER_01]: a trait in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then does that male plant have any special
traits, positive or negative, because
[SPEAKER_01]: those things will appear in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant has a problem, if it's
pissing you off because of this one
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, don't breed with it because that
one reason will be, what's it called,
[SPEAKER_01]: exacerbated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be exponentially displayed in the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't use that one if it's already
pissing you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's doing something that you don't
like and you go, oh, that's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what breeding is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to be drawn to it,
attracted to it, and want to reproduce
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird that we're looking at a plant
and getting that feeling, but it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: right idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go, oh, that plant right there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pollinate that one with King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the excitement that I feel when I
see the right male plant or the right
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant for a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get that feeling inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't breed with the plant just because
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not best practices to breed with the
male plant just because you've got it,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because somebody gave me a male
plant, just because I have some pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean you have to breed with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding should be about selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selection should be a very important part
of your breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider it like, sure, you could let
somebody else pick out the pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's just like somebody sending you
sperm and you're making babies with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the fuck do I know what's going to
come out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to do a little bit of selection
in that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to deal with the progeny
forever, so why don't I do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: selection?
[SPEAKER_01]: So color, trichomes, special traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I want to touch on is I
usually do not use the first male plants
[SPEAKER_01]: to show me that they are male and to go
into flower and start producing pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me explain that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hypothetically say I run a batch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say a batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plenty of seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of those are going to be females.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go to another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of them are going to be males.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting them in our project right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those plants are going to start
showing that they're male even before we
[SPEAKER_01]: put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are getting cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when they go into flower,
it's going to take about 14 days for most
[SPEAKER_01]: of them to show me that they're dudes,
but some of them are going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: popping balls early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to use the male plants that
start popping balls and showing sex too
[SPEAKER_01]: early because in my opinion, those plants
are going to contribute too much of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves to my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is when I breed that male
plant to a female plant, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see enough of the female plant in the
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be just reproducing that
male plant more often than not out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny, the offspring of that breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to find a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory, my opinion is that that plant
has just got too much testosterone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just too much of a beefcake.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a gym rat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything he breeds do, all the kids are
going to look just like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got fucking six kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all look just like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to do it to where the breeding
looks a little bit like mommy and a little
bit like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit like daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope for 50-50 in the mix when I do
breeding because if not, then I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: recreating the female or recreating the
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is I don't like to use the
male plants that express flower and start
[SPEAKER_01]: showing their flower and showing their sex
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got, I said I wasn't going to pick
a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to pick a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got 10 of them, I probably get rid
of the first three right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three to show me flower,
not going to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to work with that third,
four, five, and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are probably going to be the
ones I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The later plants to show me flower,
I don't want those for the exact opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to make my offspring take
way too long to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want those plants that are right in the
middle, that show me good traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: that show me good potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now something else people are doing,
we are using sex testing through labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the lab, you can actually take a
clipping of your leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a little tiny, like a hole
punch of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send that to a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can test that sample for the presence
of cannabinoid precursors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're able to send your male plants to
a lab, and they can tell you that that
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant has a high opportunity,
a high potential for cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: use that bad dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great way to do some breeding
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always, like I said before, like to see
the plants, touch the plants, rub them,
[SPEAKER_01]: feel them, smell them, abuse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I like to do breeding
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't use those earlier flowering males
because that's going to transfer into the
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to flower too quickly,
and they are also going to be too beef
[SPEAKER_01]: cakey, too much of that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at least half of your offspring is
going to show the male traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind when you are
selecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're going to add that male to,
at least 50% will be, if we do this
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly, hopefully, at least 50% of that
is going to be displayed in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever you're adding to that mix is
going to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make it a good male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it something worthwhile, something
you'd be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said a moment ago, don't just take
a male plant because one of your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: has a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it could be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may make some gems, but you may make
some complete garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about selecting that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that male gets your attention,
if it's what you want, do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's growing weird, if it's wonky,
if it's got problems, get rid of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is going to cause you more
problems down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get into the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to really tell what we have
created with these male plants is by
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out the seeds that they were used
to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way to find out if your male
plant was really a good selection is to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate multiple females with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you need to pollinate
multiple females because if you just
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate one plant and it works,
that could be an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a fluke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pollinate multiple plants and they
are all great, all of the offspring come
[SPEAKER_01]: out amazing, you did a really good
selection job.
[SPEAKER_01]: If 50% of them are great, you did a pretty
good selection job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first time you do this,
you just want to see what you created and
[SPEAKER_01]: see how your selection process worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got multiple female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took your favorite male plant out of
the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pollinated those girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's going to take you about eight,
maybe nine weeks to get those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to get the seeds out, get everything
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to germinate and grow a
bunch of seeds, keep them separated,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them numbered and labeled,
document the growth and see what you've
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where we see, did we choose the
correct male?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that male give to the mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the traits of that male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the traits of your female plants
which you have pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now grow out those seeds and try to
identify this plant is doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This trait is from the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This trait is from the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now grow out the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This trait is from the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This trait is from the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to see what that male is delivering
across the board to multiple crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got good feedback,
good data, good input on what that dude is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually delivering in the mix,
what he's adding to the progeny,
[SPEAKER_01]: what he's doing to the breeding,
what you're contributing to your breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is the funnest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breed, make a bunch of seeds,
then grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you kept a clone of that male,
because if you like what you did,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you know you've got a solid male.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a bunch more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make more of your favorites out
of that first batch, replace the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't like the outcome of and put new
bad bitches in there, pollinate those,
[SPEAKER_01]: test those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of the way that I got my
start with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollinated some things, grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, this is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sent those out, let friends grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: While they were growing them, I pollinated
more shit to find out if I had a real stud
[SPEAKER_01]: on my hands or if I just hit one out of
the park accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out King Solomon is a fucking
stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything he pollinates grows with more
vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates more resin, more potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just solves all of the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call King Solomon the problem solver,
the improver, and the fixer of most
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we now?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow out those plants and you find
out that that male didn't do what you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted it to do, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not relying on it, if this is
not your business, and it should not be
[SPEAKER_01]: your business yet, that's something we
should touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't been making seeds and
testing seeds and doing this, don't jump
[SPEAKER_01]: in this as a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first run of seeds is a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know that you've even made
anything good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put your name on this yet until you
grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the first round isn't good,
fucking give those seeds away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them to the birds, flush them,
or let your friends grow them for free,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't charge them for them and let
them know, hey, these are kind of some B
[SPEAKER_01]: grade seeds, but they're free.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't mind free shit if it's kind
of B grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some goals and some standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only you know if you have met your goals
and if you are accepting your standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write down some goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write down some plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write down some predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you're meeting your goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you are correct with your
hypothesis when it comes to growing out
[SPEAKER_01]: your progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are intimidated by
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think that they've got to
have some gigantic space for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a lot of work in a very small
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow plants out and find a male in
one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do it in a cup if you really
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sprout your seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it till it's, what's that,
four, five, maybe six inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go into flower in like 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could find out if you've got boys or
girls at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, you can choose if you want
to put them back into veg or you can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can re-veg them when you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not need a lot of space to make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've got a male selected,
you can put a couple of females or one
[SPEAKER_01]: female in a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put that male plant in a one
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them in a very small two by two room
with a very small light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll make seeds very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take a lot of setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you don't get the pollen to the
plants you don't want seeded, that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: main concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stagger my crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm breeding in a small space,
the pollen crop is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next crop is in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I don't pollinate my seedless,
my scentsy crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: My smoke crop doesn't get seeded because I
just simply stagger them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a little two by two space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put two plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them on a date, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need all of the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That people assume they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that wraps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say father plants,
male plants kind of make the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that I'm known for maybe we
don't all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am known for the King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool was known for his Jack the Ripper
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are just known for their
very popular male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what sets the breeders
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what makes their standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that seedsherenow.com will not sell
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just took like, so if you were to
buy a pack of Arise and just use my Arise
[SPEAKER_01]: male, and pollinate a bunch of shit,
James Bean won't accept you as a vendor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have to take my Arise and
breed it to something and then pull your
[SPEAKER_01]: own male out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to do a little bit of work is
what we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make your own male, find your own male
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just, you can, but don't just accept
pollen or male plants as gifts from
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important to do a
thorough selection process for a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is my lesson on male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to do that because in the future
we're going to talk about reversing a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the episode on reversing females.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people said, Hey, can you do this
to a boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a full other podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be coming in the very near
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a subtle reminder for all you
potheads out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother's Day is coming Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode will come out on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday is Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got someone to get some flowers
for someone to give some thanks to,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a fair warning from your stoner
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother's Day is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't forget mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
