[SPEAKER_12]: Hey everyone, this is Dab and Branny,
and you're listening to the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_12]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit, roster Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Thursday and that means it's time for
another Throwback Thursday episode of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions or any contests,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of that stuff has expired.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no advertisements, promotions,
giveaways or contests that are valid in
[SPEAKER_05]: these old episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys for listening and
with no further ado, here's a block of old
[SPEAKER_05]: episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for episode number 169 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_05]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_05]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me roster Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is a frosty cold
Thursday evening here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 20 degrees outside, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stay nice and warm because
the only reason I know it's so cold is
[SPEAKER_05]: because I had to answer the door for the
FedEx guy and he just brought me a box of
[SPEAKER_05]: hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have got some sweet new custom Grow From
Your Heart Podcast hoodies, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the front left breast, there's the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without my face, it's got the,
it says Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the red, yellow and green EQ bar,
like on your recording equipment or on
[SPEAKER_05]: your old school stereo to let you know
you're not blowing up your levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the back, it's got the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast logo with the EQ
[SPEAKER_05]: bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's got my big old face right on
there, just like the logo you see on
[SPEAKER_05]: iTunes, just like that logo you see on
Stitcher, just like the logo on the
[SPEAKER_05]: website.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the Grow From Your Heart Podcast
official logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is now available on the back of a
hoodie, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are interested in one of those
hoodies, send me an email,
[SPEAKER_05]: growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll teach you how you can get one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to get one to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: These hoodies, of course, were made by our
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need some custom printed t-shirts,
if you need custom printed hoodies,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you need some hat pins made,
ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse and
[SPEAKER_05]: highly recommend Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are members of the cannabis
community and I love supporting community
[SPEAKER_05]: members.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find HandmadeApparel at
handmadeapparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send them an email.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will get you all of the information
that you need to get your stuff printed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get started with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know that you heard about them
through the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know you're listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know that I sent them your
direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would both appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to tell a quick story about why I
really respect and enjoy the company of
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Adam Hand, the founder, the
proprietor, the main dude there of
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a quick little rant on why I respect
this dude so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at the Denver Cannabis Cup one time,
in Denver, of course, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was at a place called the Exdo
Event Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the place was too tiny for how many
people were in the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was frustrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me too long to park.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me way too long to get in the
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they searched my backpack,
they took some shit away from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made me give some things away that
I'd planned on taking in, but they
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't let me take it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't going to wait in line again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of frustrated me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when I got in there, the place was so
crowded that I literally got stuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: In an intersection of people for several
minutes and could not go left,
[SPEAKER_05]: I could not go right, I could not go
forward, and I could not go backward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trapped.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do not like being trapped.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it put me in a little bit of a shitty
mood, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get out of that big clusterfuck of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first booth I come upon with
familiar faces was the Handmade Apparel
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oil Slick booth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked at Adam Hand from Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first thing that flew out of my
face was, boy, this is a clusterfuck,
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know now that was the wrong thing to
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the wrong mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that because Adam Hand looked
at me and he said, brother, I came all the
[SPEAKER_05]: way from Washington for this and look at
all these people that are here having a
[SPEAKER_05]: good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took me about a half a second to
snap out of my shitty mood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went, this dude's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have had a shitty parking
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: They may have taken away some cans of
butane out of my backpack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have taken 10 minutes to stand in an
intersection with a bunch of high people
[SPEAKER_05]: doing nothing, trying to figure out which
way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an amazing cannabis-themed event.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people from all over the world were
there smoking weed with me and my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just needed that quick snap from Adam
Hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gave it to me politely and kindly
and respectfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's a really kind dude and he's super
polite.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like I've been going on about
the Handmade Apparel crew for a really
[SPEAKER_05]: long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much respect, much love to the entire
Handmade crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Adam Hand and his
beautiful fiancee, Ms. Jackie Oh at the
[SPEAKER_05]: Oil Slick crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I support that company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I support those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love supporting cannabis community
members.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to quit kissing their butts now
and move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you guys, thanks for the hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're listening, the Handmade crew,
the hoodies look freaking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, the printing came out so smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Irene Genetics hoodie that I am
actually wearing right now, I've probably
[SPEAKER_05]: been wearing this every day it's cold,
every day that it's kind of chilly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wear this probably for like a year now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the printing is still perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hoodie is getting a little fuzzy
because, you know, it's getting worn.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stitching, it's got some fuzz marks,
like it's coming frayed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But bro, the printing is solid still.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every bit of printing on here is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I'm sure that those grow from your
hard hoods.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hoodies are going to look just as good
for just as long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to doing business with you
in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need some t-shirts soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need some grow from your hard podcast
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, I like to keep the
listeners updated on my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys know that I've got a breeding
project underway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few days ago, I put pollen on those
girls.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really see the seeds bulking up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only been a few days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how far apart those episodes
are going to come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to quote how many days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's been several days, a few several
days, and the seeds are bulking up.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the pistils on the plants are
really brown and curled up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could tell that pollen got in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I applied so much pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I kind of got a little bit
crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put more pollen than I should have,
but I wanted to make sure to have a shit
[SPEAKER_05]: ton of seeds and it is working.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me give you an update and a
reminder of what I bred.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took in a rise F1 male.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's golden goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: The golden goat female was pollinated by a
daybreaker male that made a rise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used that arise male.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have pollinated cookies and cream,
white widow, lemon Jeffrey, grateful dog,
[SPEAKER_05]: and several other beautiful females.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a flow plant in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got pollinated also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some, what else is in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other arise phenotypes in there
so that I can make more of the arise F2.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here in about seven weeks or so,
those should be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll get to see what cookies and
cream cross to arise does and what white
[SPEAKER_05]: widow cross to the arise will do.
[SPEAKER_05]: My goal, you guys, that cookies and cream
plant was one of the most resinous,
[SPEAKER_05]: frostiest plants I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the taste on it was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That plant made some of the best bubble
hash and ice hash I have ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it yielded really heavy on the
shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we make shatter, we would get more
shatter than it from any other strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem was if you wanted bud
form, it made buds the size of like my
[SPEAKER_05]: thumb tip, just like the top of my thumb,
just little popcorn balls up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stick all the way up and down the
stick, just little popcorn balls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're shitty to trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't put out a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the plants just kind of, they're just
wispy to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the best grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hit it with the arise pollen because
arise makes these gigantic, huge colas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that I can get those giant
colas with as much resin and as much
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor and carry that arise growth tree
over to the cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the arise females have been testing in
the 29 to 31% THC-A range.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of THC available to put
into this cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had the cookies and cream cross
tested myself, but I've seen it test high
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's available at Kindlove and
several other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping I get that really high THC,
THC-A value on the test there with that
[SPEAKER_05]: cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: So look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll post pictures of it when those seeds
are ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will grow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll post pictures of that on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am irey underscore genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check out the progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a whole bunch of good stuff
up on there right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll also let you guys on the podcast know
how it's going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my breeding update.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of updates, I read an email on
the last episode from a man who wants to
[SPEAKER_05]: start a cannabis podcast in the UK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since I read that email, he has
responded.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to read the whole email,
but I'll just read a quick portion of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Hey dude, Ross here messaging off
the podcast email address.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great show today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some great advice, but I must apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, I wasn't clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually met Mrs. May, Theresa May,
our new female prime minister.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems she's okay and passionate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's where I screwed up you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew I was saying something wrong
when I said it last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt wrong when I said it, but he said,
MP means members of parliament are
[SPEAKER_05]: equivalent to your Congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, I'm sorry if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, are members equivalent to your
Congress?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and I'm sorry if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we do also have a military
police, but they're strictly military,
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing political.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I said, excuse for the throat
clearing, he wrote a message saying that
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the prime minister was okay,
was possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what the stance was right
now, because I'm talking too fast trying
[SPEAKER_05]: to read an email, but he said that the MPs
were supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know what MP stood for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the American in me took it as military
police.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I was just reading an email quickly
and trying to come up with a solution
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spattered out military police.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was wrong as shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: MP, in this dude's meaning, stood for
members of parliament.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I didn't embarrass your country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope I didn't embarrass myself too much by
saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't trying to be offensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I apologize and thanks for correcting
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to be corrected, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to be right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm wrong on something, feel free to
correct me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he also goes on to say,
for you to say you're confident that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: the right person from how I write means a
lot as I'm that guy who thinks he sucks at
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't suck at everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be a great podcaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also goes on to talk about how he is
acquiring equipment and getting his
[SPEAKER_05]: computer ready for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to hearing your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he's going to record a couple
episodes and send them to me so that I can
[SPEAKER_05]: give him some pointers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure that you get a couple of good
episodes recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you launch into iTunes,
make sure that you get all of your friends
[SPEAKER_05]: to listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you have a Twitter account set
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you can tweet those podcasts out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe start a Twitter account now and
start developing relationships with
[SPEAKER_05]: friends on Twitter so that when you do
launch material, they'll be there already
[SPEAKER_05]: waiting to retweet your podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something you could work on,
but go ahead and send me a few episodes
[SPEAKER_05]: when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to listen to them and give
you some guidance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do it for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to a lot of podcasts,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spend all day working on plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've always got an earbud in my ear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just listening to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually asked, me to mention
what podcasts I listen to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, I've got my phone in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just grab this and I'll scroll
through really quickly here and I'll tell
[SPEAKER_05]: you just a few of the podcasts I listen
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the random emails I get,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: People ask me, what podcasts are you
listening to?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to answer that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to go in order from the
top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug loves movies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug loves minis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this one's on here, but it may
get deleted real soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Julian loves music.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not the greatest podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a spinoff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a copy of Doug loves movies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's hard to listen to you guys,
but sometimes there's good episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: How Comedy Works with Wendy Curtis and
Rick Kearns.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Comedy Works podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Nerdist, Truth and Eliza.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot more, you guys,
but that's mainly what I listen to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting to the weed section.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been listening to the Spliff podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to listen to the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't paid attention to that one
lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dude Grows is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get a chance to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legion of Skanks is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then down on the bottom of my list,
Monday morning podcast with Bill Burr and
[SPEAKER_05]: FitzDawg Raider.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I've ever listened to his
podcast, but it's in my feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the podcasts I'm listening
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put the show back on track a little
bit and talk a little bit about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to read some listener emails
because when the listeners send emails,
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I'm answering the questions
you want to hear, and I'm actually getting
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody's attention and helping somebody
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this one comes from a regular listener
and someone that contacts me a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's from FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up FastBerry?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, really enjoy the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few quick questions for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he did really list a couple of
few questions here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how long these take.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we might read some more emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might do a product review, depends on
how much time we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you always grown using bottled
nutrients and why or why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly I use bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how I learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have reached, okay, so I guess this is
why I've had my best test results and my
[SPEAKER_05]: best flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of my favorite crops have come
from my trusted source of nutrients that I
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used so many brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have used advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used psycho.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have used Fox Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used Aurora Soul Synthetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the name of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have used roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may be mixing Aurora and then Soul
Synthetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those might be two different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used the root stuff with like the
Buddha looking bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have used Dutchmaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have used Dynagro or Pro-Tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Dynagro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used so many brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite honestly is Botanicare Pure
Blend Pro Bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cocoa base, grow and bloom with a
little bit of liquid karma, some Cal Mag,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever they make.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole line of stuff,
but I prefer most of the Botanicare stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Pure Blend Pro line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I added a couple other things in
there, like just a couple other things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I probably won't mention too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's mainly my main mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some worm castings in there and I
put in some stuff to get the roots going a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I add my own, you know,
a couple of little proprietary things in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also like a product called Humble Honey.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm using Botanicare, put some Humble
Honey in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those things that from the bottles,
I grew a really great crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every plant in there goes
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the bottle.
And then I add a little bit of Humble
Honey.
[SPEAKER_05]: to hit the worm casting store,
the feed store, the hydro store,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then go to Big R to get tubs to mix
all this shit in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting a little overwhelming for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got time to do it and you can do
that, go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was running a bottle crop and an
organic crop and it was kind of getting to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a little bit tedious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I live in a house and I'm not the only
one that lives here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to do some of the stinky shit
bothered some of the other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that wasn't cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I lived alone, if I had the only one
ever here, because sometimes when I mix up
[SPEAKER_05]: a tea and I put some fish emulsion and
stuff in there and some bokashi and the
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that comes out of the kashi bucket,
the leachate, the lactic acid bacteria,
[SPEAKER_05]: it stinks up the whole house.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's in the basement in the back left
corner, you can't be in the top story of
[SPEAKER_05]: the house in the top right corner without
smelling it because it is just rank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's part of why I don't do the
organics at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love, honestly, I've been reading
about it and thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to make this shift to know
till organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to be able to set up some
compost in the garage, put a worm farm in
[SPEAKER_05]: the garage, get that sort of a thing going
and then just use, it sounds really
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome to be able to use the same pots
for every cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cut the plant out, shake the roots
off, put another plant in there,
[SPEAKER_05]: put some compost in there, some worm
castings in there and get it going again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have not always grown with bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done the organic as fuck method.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done outdoor stuff that we just did
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did amended soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one summer where everything got
stolen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to quit talking about that
because I've had multiple summers where
[SPEAKER_05]: everything got fucking stolen and that
sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all my outdoor stuff was amended soils
and no bottled nutrients at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the bottles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the mad scientist feeling of it,
but I also like the amended soils and the
[SPEAKER_05]: teas because of the organic feeling and
I'm a dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got dreadlocks and I like all that
natural sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have not always grown with bottles
and that is kind of why and why not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to move on to the next part
of your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I like well-made bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why or why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love some well-made bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like some full melt like the Colorado
Extract Company makes this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We take, so we'll grow, not we,
a commercial grow, we'll grow plants and
[SPEAKER_05]: take off the big leaves and then freeze
the buds, like cut them off the sticks and
[SPEAKER_05]: then freeze the buds while they're still
wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got fresh frozen buds and you
take them to, there are several companies
[SPEAKER_05]: that do it, but Colorado Extract Company
made my favorite so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take it to these companies and they'd
wash it for you and they keep the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: time they do it, the whole time they do
the extraction, they keep your product and
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's 55 degrees or it might be 65
degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The room is that cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your product is kept on ice the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hash that comes out of there,
it's sold to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kept in a refrigerator at the
dispensary and a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_05]: the hip kids bring a little cooler to buy
it because it's sold to you still cool and
[SPEAKER_05]: the resin heads look like beach sand in
the container.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bubble hash because that's full
melt hash and we'll take that and fold a
[SPEAKER_05]: piece of parchment paper in half and put
it in the middle and heat up the carb cap
[SPEAKER_05]: just a little bit and roll a carb cap out
on it and it presses it out and it makes
[SPEAKER_05]: like a little, it looks like a piece of
shatter at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a little thin layer of hash and
you can see through it and then we take
[SPEAKER_05]: dabs of it like that when it's pressed out
and it just burns so much more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, you can tell by the passion in
my voice right now that I'm drooling over
[SPEAKER_05]: a nice dab of some good solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love bubble hash if it's done
correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is there are too many
companies not doing it correctly and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: too overpriced and it has to be stored,
kept cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I do like, they take some of that
hash, that really nice 120 or 90 micron
[SPEAKER_05]: bubble hash and then they press it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They run it through like a rosin press and
the stuff that comes out of that,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh that is delicious you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes out white and it looks like white
silly putty or the stuff that I used to
[SPEAKER_05]: use when I was in high school and wanted
to put posters on the basement wall but
[SPEAKER_05]: the wall didn't take nails.
[SPEAKER_05]: She used this weird goo tacky stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like that but the dabs out of it
were so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be so tasty and I would get really
medicated really quickly from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a full body high.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you smoke shatter, I don't think it
gets to my body as much as I think the
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, obviously I do like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you say, you talk about your favorite
strain to breed with, oh hold on phone
[SPEAKER_05]: just blacked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You often talk about your favorite strain
to breed with, breed with of to make hash
[SPEAKER_05]: oil but if you had to pick a desert island
10 pack of seeds, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I think you said that I talk
about a lot of my favorite, let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you kind of stumbled out some
words there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about your favorite strain to breed
with of to make hash oil but if you had to
[SPEAKER_05]: pick a desert island 10 pack of seeds,
what would they be?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to take this as if I had to
pick 10 seeds, a 10 pack of seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: what 10 pack would I pick to be on a
desert island?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's a deserted island because
on a desert island it's going to suck
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to grow some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I've got plenty of clean water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I can find some stuff to make
some organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be fish around if I'm on
an island, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be able to find some fish and make
some fish nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 pack of seeds, that's really a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And see, this is going to frustrate a lot
of people because I've got a seed vault of
[SPEAKER_05]: my own that nobody has ever had access to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably something like the lemon
Jeffrey grateful dog cross is a really
[SPEAKER_05]: good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I call that lemon sorbet.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 pack of that would be really cool if I
were stuck on a deserted island.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grateful dog might be the one to pick dude
because it's got the flavor, it's got the
[SPEAKER_05]: aroma, it's got that stank.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's where I'm going to go weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grateful dog is feminine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be stuck on a deserted
island with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want regular seeds so that I can breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's such a tough choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I've bred probably, it would
have to be one of my creations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something regular, something that came
from the Arise might be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dubwise might be a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were stuck and people are like,
you never even talk about Dubwise,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It produces huge colas and it's got a
couple of good phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a really hazy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a more indica phenotype,
but they all test high in THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the grateful dog were regular seed,
that would be my pick because then I could
[SPEAKER_05]: get an OG Kush leaning phenotype,
a Chem 91 leaning phenotype, and then I
[SPEAKER_05]: could get a male and then I could breed
and then I could start doing some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I had a 10 pack of seeds,
that's all I need to make magic happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just left me alone on a deserted
island, we would have N crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would have out crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would have F6s eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just go nuts with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the grateful dog were regular seed,
that would be my first choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lemon Jeffrey grateful dog is also a
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all my favorites here are becoming
feminized.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cascade would be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I might have to say Arise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arise might be the winner because it's
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could grab a 10 pack of that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I start thinking, see,
I'm just rambling today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to go way old school and
say like, why not some old like brother's
[SPEAKER_05]: grim seeds or some Mr. Nice seeds from way
back in the day, because that's when stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: was real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really neat way back then before we
started kind of just breeding for a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: random stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old breeders seem to have more goals
in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: They seem to have more more foresight for
their breeding now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like everybody's breeding
for a lot of hype and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: jump on the Skittles train or whatever it
seems to be next.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of Skittles, that leads me
right into the next part of your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fastberry says, I live in Rhode Island and
can't really look hard into getting elite
[SPEAKER_05]: clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were me, what cutting should I be
looking out for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of depends on what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, if you're looking for like
headstache for yourself, you might want
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're trying to grow some weight,
you might want another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you needed Indica, you want one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need a sativa, you want another
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are trying to go for flavor,
you might want something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now what I'm noticing, everything
tangy is popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry banana tangy, double banana
tangy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a banana sherbet that goes around.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a banana split.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that, like that Crockett family
farm stuff is super popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Skittles with a Z, I think they're
calling it Skittles because they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: call it Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: They got to spell it with a Z.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Skittles is super popular right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's loving the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's next.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish one of my strains was this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next type, but you can't just make it
the next type.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's got to fall in love with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be the next type.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything with tangy in it, people are
really in love with tangy right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That strawberry banana tangy type of stuff
is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a really heavy producer,
straight up tangy works well for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want more of an Indica type of
tangy product, I would say the Taffy was
[SPEAKER_05]: great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that sort of stuff is what's really
popular right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to predict because one day it
was Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a long time it was OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you could sell was OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had a bag of OG Kush and a bag of
whatever else, that OG Kush would sell
[SPEAKER_05]: first.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could buy a tripled OG Kush of
everything else because you were going to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell that OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone wanted OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was Girl Scout cookies,
and then it was Gorilla Glue, and then it
[SPEAKER_05]: was Tangy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was Golden Goat for a little
while before that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard to predict what's going to be
the next hype strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I hyped up a whole bunch of that
Crockett family farm stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could also say maybe, what do you want
in your garden?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a Rise, you want Cascade,
you want Firefly, you want Morning Dew,
[SPEAKER_05]: you want... Those are all strains that I
have made and I'm just trying to push my
[SPEAKER_05]: products, which I mean, if you want my
stuff, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a Rise is a really reliable
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something you want in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, you said you're in Rhode
Island.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure I know some activists and
cannabis consumers up in that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am sure that they've got some elite
cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will try to put you in touch with some
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, if you need a couple of
elites, we can put some good stuff in your
[SPEAKER_05]: hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about clone trading.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think people should clone hoard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think sometimes I will keep some stuff
back because I'm a breeder and I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: want everything out because I'm going to
breed to things and that's kind of my
[SPEAKER_05]: magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once I give a clone out, I try not to
say, hey, don't give that out to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like once I've given a clone out,
that clone's going places.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know guys, if you tell them,
hey, don't give this out, the first thing
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to do is go, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to give you the middle
finger and they're going to make as many
[SPEAKER_05]: clones of that plant as they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm all about free trade cloning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody should have a clone
exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down to trade seeds for clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down to trade clones for clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down to trade clones for seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it should keep moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's how people find the perfect
strain for themselves and their gardens
[SPEAKER_05]: and or their medical patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think clone trading should happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can find somebody in your area or
if you can find somebody in your area,
[SPEAKER_05]: wherever you are, whoever you are,
if you could find somebody to trade clones
[SPEAKER_05]: with, I highly encourage it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make sure that when you get home that
you treat those clones for pests and you
[SPEAKER_05]: also quarantine them to keep them away
from the rest of your garden for a few
[SPEAKER_05]: days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that if there is something wrong,
you don't go infesting the rest of your
[SPEAKER_05]: garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I kind of answered your question on
what cuttings you should be looking for,
[SPEAKER_05]: any of that Crockett stuff, any irie
genetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, alien rock candy has been real
popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's alien rock candy available,
grab that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been real popular here in Colorado
lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Fast Barry, let's see what else he has
to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, sorry for so many questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a few of the thoughts around the
old noggin, the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: My address is, no, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: He does give me his address so that I can
send him some stickers and stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I won't bust you out and read that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to thank you once again for
sending me an email.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been friends online for quite a
while now, and I do appreciate the
[SPEAKER_05]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody out there has a question or
they'd like to say something, feel free to
[SPEAKER_05]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do have a ton of emails to respond
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I plan on answering as many of them as I
can on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got messages from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got messages from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a ton of emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am working my way through them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only put out so much content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've secretly been working on another
project that in a few days here,
[SPEAKER_05]: I may make an announcement about,
but right now I need to keep that under
[SPEAKER_05]: wraps, but it's been taking a lot of my
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why there was not a Thursday
episode this week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took last Thursday off for the
Thanksgiving holiday.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was not a Thursday episode for two
weeks in a row now, but I will get those
[SPEAKER_05]: coming again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I get back on my schedule,
I got something else going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took up a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back on the flow now, so I'll be able
to put out more regular quality episodes
[SPEAKER_05]: again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if you want to hear something,
if you've got a question, a comment,
[SPEAKER_05]: just feel free sending me an email.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take a second and tell you guys
about a service called Patreon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recently made a Patreon account for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check it out, it is patreon
.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: What Patreon is, is a service that will
allow my listeners to donate financial
[SPEAKER_05]: contributions to the podcast to help me
pay for the web hosting of this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen,
iReadGeneticsColorado.com costs a little
[SPEAKER_05]: over $300 per year for me to keep up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is where all of the podcasts are
host.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a hundred episodes there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am just trying to offset that financial
burden out of my pocket by asking the
[SPEAKER_05]: listeners to contribute to my Patreon
account.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can contribute as little as $1 per
month.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do not think there is a limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can put as many zeros on the
end of that as you would like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would appreciate it if you would sign
up at Patreon.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you feel like this podcast has given
you some value, if you've learned
[SPEAKER_05]: something, if you've been entertained,
$1 a month is all I ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's something you can do, that is
excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to offset the cost of my
website so that we can keep the show up
[SPEAKER_05]: for free.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sponsorships do help.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some sponsors on board now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really helps a lot.

[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody once again for

[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a huge shout out to my boy
Hydro in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro, that mustache is rocking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get down to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bank, large amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this life, one thing counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the bank, large amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time working on the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mined on the money, so I guess the money's
on my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tricks, I get bucked for the dollar sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even chicks, I won't find if they're not a
dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of being good with the look,
I need her in the kitchen fixing up and
[SPEAKER_02]: cooking the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me in the hood with the
crooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting my feet wet like I stuck my foot
in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get the money, I'll be harming your
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carving your dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bleeding with your arm and your leg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear everybody starving for bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, try my margarine spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still me like Jenny from the block
with a piggy bank ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bunch of pennies for my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your fetty in the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And watch me bounce, because one thing
counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Large amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this life, one thing counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bank, large amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this life, one thing counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bank, large amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this life, one thing counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bank, large amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this life, one thing counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the bank, large amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that counts, but as of late,
friends eat what's on my plate,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I can't make ends meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I hear is, can I get you back next
week?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get me that check, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says I nickel and dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't make it rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: A slight trickle is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if I were a rich man, then I'd play a
little whittled fiddle on the roof,
[SPEAKER_02]: sipping some wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We raise the stakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We force the ante up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bet your bottom dollar, little harpin'
ante slut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tore her panties up, like I tore the
envelope to get your birthday card.
[SPEAKER_02]: He scored your granny bumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always keep your fanny tucked
underneath your long shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see me waiting for you outside when
you get off work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make you kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So put your hands to the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch, it's great facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this life, one thing counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a robbery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the ex-presidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the Vengemends bending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Empty your pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it don't make dollars, it don't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me your wallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do your purses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cash rules everything around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: More money, more problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your rupees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your shekels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your dollar currency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your foreign partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Partner with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trade, because then you don't need a bank
account.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for episode number 170 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're a news smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_05]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_05]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_05]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Kat and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying not to cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tried so hard not to cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I reached for a return to the music and
coughed at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I sped through the intro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, also welcome to the
podcast, sitting across the table from me,
[SPEAKER_05]: looking sharp in his sweet new great white
shark grassroots hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse Witt is back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you guys stalk Jesse on
Instagram while we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is at jessiegrows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the Call a Rod Dope podcast have an
Instagram now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been posting some cool ganja
pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the stream you posted the other
day?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Smurf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Smurfs.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the cross on the Smurfs?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's blue tie something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue tie something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sure.
All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of a strain from a shop he
used to work at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's kind of why I asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering how much info I was going
to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sounds like we need to cut this
part of the conversation short.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving forward, ladies and gentlemen,
make sure you go stalk Jesse while he's
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, go check out my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to handmadeapparel.biz because this
part of the podcast is brought to you by
[SPEAKER_05]: our good friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, my friends at Handmade Apparel
made me some hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the Grow From Your Heart podcast
logo right above the left breast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have my face on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the back, it's got the Grow From
Your Heart podcast logo with my big cheesy
[SPEAKER_05]: face on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: These hoodies are sweet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're interested in one, send me an
email.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten two emails so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took on a new project and I have not
replied to many emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will get back to you probably after I
record.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested in a hoodie,
send me a message.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse picked up the hoodies and made the
big cheesiest smile that I've seen in a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty cool looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird to see a hoodie with my
face on it, but people will be wearing
[SPEAKER_05]: them and I'll have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to my friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be an interesting
podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been taking some big fat dabs of
some Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a fun show.
[SPEAKER_05]: But big shout out to my friends at
Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need some shirts made, if you need
something printed, if you need stickers,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you need some hat pins made,
go check out handmadeapparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great people, great folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the hoodies, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said it once before, but I can't get
over that logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks so sweet on a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super, super high quality printing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that printing smooth?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like they put a sticker on a
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially once it ages a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope as fuck, Jesse said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Jesse's kind of into the punk rock
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once it fades and it doesn't look brand
new, is that when you're going to like it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't look so fresh and clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to wear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to go spill some beer on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did I want to make sure to
mention?
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I thought about the other day on
the podcast, and I'm sure that Jesse will
[SPEAKER_05]: agree with what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another word I was trying to
find, but I can't find the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I owe you a huge thank you for
trusting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys listen to me and I give you
advice about your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: which are used for your medicine to keep
you healthy or in another way to keep your
[SPEAKER_05]: wallet fat.
[SPEAKER_05]: However it's happening, I'm helping you
out and you trust me with your financial
[SPEAKER_05]: and your medicinal investment and your
time and your energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You trust what I say and that means a lot
to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for trusting me and thanks
for trusting me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for believing that my guidance is
correct and thanks for believing in me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized the other day that there are a
lot of people out there that say,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about cannabis,
ask Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just thanks for believing in me and
trusting me to guide you through your
[SPEAKER_05]: garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's enough rambling for the
start of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's here and he wanted to talk about
composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a message and he said,
I have had composting on my head all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I don't think compost is quite
what's in your head, but it's close.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk a little bit about
composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you want to start, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to jump right into it with
anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, I don't even know where to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the first note that I took was
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, let's do it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bokashi is, for anyone that's not
familiar, it is a grain that has been
[SPEAKER_06]: inoculated with an EM1 culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: An endogenous microorganism.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how that's done?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they spray like a barley.
[SPEAKER_06]: You soak it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: With possibly a dairy product.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you end up with the EM1.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fermented milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you take a culture you collect and you
mix it with milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it ferments and that's how you end up
with what they call labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lactic acid bacteria.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from that, you can turn that into EM1
and you can take the EM1, inoculate your
[SPEAKER_06]: grain, ferment it again, let it dry out
and boom, you've got Bokashi grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So- Are you making the Bokashi or are you
buying the Bokashi you pre-made?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting the Bokashi right now from
Victor with Innovative Organics up in
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really good and it's pretty damn
cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and he's a small local business that
is, that's taking food out of the,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, landfills.
Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's- Well, let's teach the people
about the Bokashi bucket a little bit then
[SPEAKER_05]: since you said taking food out of the
landfills, that's going to make people
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see one from where we're sitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be advantageous to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically a five gallon bucket with a
spigot on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little collection tray in the
bottom that prevents the solid particles
[SPEAKER_05]: from getting in the way of the spigot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically I fill that thing with my
vegetable scraps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't eat any meat products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all my vegetable scraps, the tips of my
carrots, the ends of my avocados,
[SPEAKER_05]: the avocado pits go in there and they
disintegrate completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff that goes to waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything I would throw away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sitting near the trash can to
encourage me instead of putting it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes in the Kashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fill it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fill up a bowl, like a glass bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I dump that glass bowl into the
Bokashi bucket because it's much easier
[SPEAKER_05]: that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have to open it as frequently
because it smells like hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got a five gallon bucket with a
lid that seals on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a spigot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually put a little layer, a thin layer
of newspaper in there just to prevent-
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause some of that particle stuff will
clog up the drain thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you put, put the paper down and then
you, I just put like a couple of banana
[SPEAKER_05]: peels, honestly, in there to get started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I used to eat a shit ton of bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two banana peels in there to get it
started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a handful of the Bokashi grain
because that is a bio-activator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just start throwing all your
scrap in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you get a nice layer,
maybe an inch or two thick, then just put
[SPEAKER_05]: a little, another handful of that Bokashi
grain on there and repeat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make a lasagna basically of scraps,
Kashi, scraps, Kashi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's an inch and a half that they
say to put in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: An inch and a half throw in more Bokashi
grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't press it down you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's going to expand in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you do want to press it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do want to press it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the air out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to squeeze all the oxygen out of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most Bokashi buckets come with a little
masher.
[SPEAKER_06]: That little masher thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's when you push it down that it
farts and makes that horrific smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also, you can squeeze a shit ton
of chile or- The leachate juice?
[SPEAKER_06]: Leachate out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever tried to clean a drain with
that juice?
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just tried it the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it work for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but it's pretty fucking clogged.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I poured, I even made sure I had enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I poured like a half gallon in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that should have unclogged.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's like a hair clog, that would
have done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got something serious in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you eat, boy?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a sink.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you make your little lasagna,
then you pack it down and then you seal it
[SPEAKER_05]: up and just leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after about 10 or 12 days,
it'll start making juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can open up the little spigot and
I use a glass mason jar to catch the
[SPEAKER_05]: juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I seal it up and then I cover it
with honestly with just a rag to keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: dark because you want to keep that away
from the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I put about an ounce per five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to mix up some nutrients,
put about an ounce of that crap in there
[SPEAKER_05]: and a five gallon bucket with my newton,
I can see the plants start up taking much
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I- Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just full of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the nutrients from the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, that's all I'm using
now in my grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even at the big grow, we've started
using it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will save on trash, save on
nutrient money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's full of humic acids, fulvic acids,
lactic acids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got bacteria and fungi in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the things that you probably
forgot about and that your bottled
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrient company probably missed also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds of- Speed up the root zone,
speed up the metabolism of your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that lactic acid, bacteria,
juice out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll start growing this white funky
foam, these big gross looking brainy
[SPEAKER_05]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's happening, you did it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because once you've drained it a few
times, I mean, you can drain it a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can leave it going and keep draining
it and mash it and drain it and mash it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll go for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But eventually what I like to do after
I've harvested, I'll take my old dirt and
[SPEAKER_05]: pour it into a big, like a big R,
it's like a feed trough for horses,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pour all the dirt into there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll pour that Bokashi bucket into
there, all that funk and mix it in and mix
[SPEAKER_05]: that in with my dirt and cover it and put
a little moisture in there and then it
[SPEAKER_05]: spreads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like that stuff, whatever I
made in the Kashi bucket grows throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: my soil at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go stir it occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll try to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to get two full Bokashi buckets
in there before I go start to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, the smell is intense when you empty
one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of smells- Especially if you're
indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like somebody threw up in the bar trash
can after drinking all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And rotten milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they ate ice cream and then drank all
day, then threw up in the bar trash can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just drain a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike can't be around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: White Mike that's on the podcast often,
he's like, oh, if you're going to do that,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fucking going home.
[SPEAKER_05]: He won't even be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guys at work love it when I fill a rez
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bokashi people on Instagram,
there's actually a company called Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use 55 gallon drums of the mixture
and then they use a forklift to lift it up
[SPEAKER_05]: and dump it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can just imagine what that smells
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just 55 gallons of dead body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Victor's doing the same thing with the
innovative organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, what was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, when you were talking about putting a
lot of banana pills in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cool thing about doing this process is
the compost that the Bokashi will
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually make the pulp itself and the
leachate from it are both they contain the
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients that the plants contained.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bananas, for instance, are super high
in potassium.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want a custom tuned Bokashi
juice, I mean, you know, look at the
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients that are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you filled that thing with bananas and
banana pills, I guarantee it'd be high in
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guaranteed.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put berries that are darker in
colors, we're going to have a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of like humics and stuff like that in
there, I assume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got your Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got this whole fuzzy white mess of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got jars of lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you said your next thing that you got
going was your worm program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about your worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started with a hundred worms back in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: A potential vendor brought them in and
just gave them to me and I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a hundred of them in like a,
you know, like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took it home and dumped them in a
smart pot full of food scraps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Initially, I put it just straight peat
moss in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's something they eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also did, I think some newspaper
then, and I kept them through the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't like real actively feeding them
or anything, but now that winter's came
[SPEAKER_06]: around, I took, I think it's a 40 gallon
container and filled it with all the worm,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, all the stuff necessary for a
good proper setup of worm bedding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been dumping the, uh,
Bokashi pulp in there and they go fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: nuts for that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've got, so, I mean, I'm just,
it's, it's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making all my nutrients at home
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you tell us a little bit about what's
in your worm bedding?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I use, I got some used phone books or
well, I think all phone books are used.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know why the fuck they still
make them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a waste of trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worm food.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shredded them up and a bunch of
newspapers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used wood chips.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a comfrey plant at home,
so that's indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went ahead and chopped all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to turn that up for you
and turn that into usable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which that's a whole nother part of my
little homestead style growing,
[SPEAKER_06]: the comfrey that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I put some of that in there and then a
full bucket of Bokashi stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to love all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I figured out, so the Bokashi stinks
like hell when it's in a open warm bin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this time I put a whole bunch of thick
layer wood chips on the top and then a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of wet newspaper to seal it all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of trap it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the smell went, I can't even smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the winter like this, it's cold,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably 12 degrees here in Colorado,
maybe lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go find out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been hanging around like 15,
20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, it's going to get stupid cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my garage, I'm guessing it's going to
be in the teens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I be able to keep my 40 gallon worm
life container in the garage right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a similar situation, but my garage
is heated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's around 65 degrees and they don't
give it like dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would almost think, I would assume
that that dirt is going to be hot anyway,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's bioactive in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the little warm farm I have,
most definitely it creates its own heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more established.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big one, I just set that up last
weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure it will start heating up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to like just say,
oh yeah, you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing I would for sure do is lift
it off the floor.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it off that cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your plants want to be off that cold
concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really sucks for plants unless it's a
real fancy heated floor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets so cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cold, so fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a heat sink.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually stills heat out of things that
are sitting on it.
So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you're drunk and you lay in the
bathtub to cool down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done that shit in so long,
but that was the first thing I could think
[SPEAKER_05]: of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got your Bokashi, you got your
worms and you're using a big 40 gallon
[SPEAKER_05]: container.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is going into your compost?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kitchen scraps at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once spring comes around, it's not cold as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I get my outdoor compost pile going,
I'll be putting all the chicken bedding in
[SPEAKER_06]: there that's mixed with chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you put like meat products in there
also?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can in Bokashi, but they say
you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually saw somebody, the Bokashi
people put their entire Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_05]: dinner, their turkey, like the carcass of
the uneaten turkey, the mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put the entire thing in there and
then they showed the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they took the thing outside and
dug a hole and buried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they planted a tree on top of
where they buried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, they explained they could put
meat in there as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just took a little longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They even say you can put feces in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things I'm not brave enough to do and
things I'm not going to do for my indoor
[SPEAKER_06]: pot garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had a big, huge, gigantic outdoor
garden, that would be it.
[SPEAKER_05]: End of the world scenario.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even dairy, cheese and stuff like
that, they say you can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put eggshells in there to increase
the amount of calcium?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally put eggshells in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like coffee filters,
newspapers, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just eats that right up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff just disappears.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get a lot of leachate on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I've been putting all my cannabis
scraps in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you run them through, if I was to
throw the leaves and stuff off my plants
[SPEAKER_06]: in the garden into the open warm bin,
I would lose most of the nitrogen and I
[SPEAKER_06]: would lose carbon through the CO2 that it
emits as it dries out and breaks down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Running them through the Bokashi bucket,
you retain all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it ferments it first and it traps
it in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then it's healthier food for the worms
and it makes a higher quality product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just richer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much richer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That fermentation is what gives it that
amazing smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Victor's been teaching me about the
wonders of Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, shout out to Victor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like he knows what he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We totally get him on the show when they
have to be on the phone.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a zoom age six.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to wherever he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what's up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a huge warehouse full of fucking
Bokashi buckets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just go sit on a bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll all get a Bokashi bucket as a chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're a ganja grower, it smells kind
of funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's a sickeningly satisfying
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that smells terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take five gallons of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that that's going to make it like
fish hydro slates and like Bokashi juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember Nirvana and Piranha or what
was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Piranha and Tarantula from Advanced
Nutrients when they made the liquids.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, those things smelled like the women's
bathroom at the park in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_05]: summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: They worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could feed your plants very little of
those things and your plants would just go
[SPEAKER_05]: ape shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never used them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, I used all of the
Advanced Nutrients products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one I've never tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to bash anything, but that's one that
I would avoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: They promise you that you'll get 30%
heavier yields, which it did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me probably 30% fatter yields than
any other brand I've ever used.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all of my different strains looked,
smelled, and tasted the exact same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hypothetically, if all those strains hit
30% THC with my regular regimen,
[SPEAKER_05]: they all hit about 20, 25 when I used it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were heavier.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot more of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd rather have, I'd rather grow a
pound and a half of Superdank than two
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds of meh.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are extremely overpriced.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you that working with them
as a vendor and a company, they are
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every hydro shop that I've tried to mess
with has said that because I would be
[SPEAKER_05]: like, Hey, can you order this new Advanced
Nutrients product?
[SPEAKER_05]: And people just shake their heads and be
like, Nope, I'll take what they send me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They send me boxes of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sell that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no asking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You replaced them with Psycho,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a side by, I've done a lot of
side-by-sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: This show just got off on our way
sidetrack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not prefer Psycho either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Psycho gave me a lot of great colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me bud density and it gave me
weight, but I did not approve of the
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor was where it was lacking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything tasted like grape Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be how all those multi-part
lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the bottles look like clear with
different dyes in them, it's all probably,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion, I don't know this for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should research this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably all came from one factory
and they just get poured into different
[SPEAKER_05]: bottles and get different names put on
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something or something similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a rule of thumb, when you're,
this is just my opinion, but as a rule of
[SPEAKER_06]: thumb, when you're shopping for a nutrient
line, try to stick with an American made
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are by far the best quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Avoid Dutch nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dutch growers grow a completely different
way than most Americans and the nutrients
[SPEAKER_06]: are formulated differently and they don't
really work well with the way most
[SPEAKER_06]: American growers grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with most of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have seen some great results though with
a couple of those Dutch brands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mills, if you follow their recipe.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can think of three brands that I
would almost buy their products if it came
[SPEAKER_05]: down to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, I mean, house and garden is-
Kana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Kana is Dutch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't carry them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's such a great product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Playground.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an old ass company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some good shit though from back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a few people that are diehard.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We order it for a couple of guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're right though about,
I've got a note somewhere that says to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about Dutch, the Dutch bred cannabis
to be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like because their grow rooms,
like the way I see it, cannabis happens on
[SPEAKER_05]: a Rocky mountain in Afghanistan where a
goat pissed on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wind beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun beat down on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a likelihood that a rock fell on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: On the, on the side of the Kush mountains
in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_05]: A rabbit lives under it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's covered in bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what the fuck my rent was
all about now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a brain injury guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I forget what the fuck I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so then the Dutch, the Dutch got ahold
of these plants and like, we want to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: them indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what a fucking Dutch accent
would sound like if I tried to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, we want to grow these indoors
and they wanted to find the best shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They bred it to be these really skinny
sticks that grow really perfect buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's like roses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like tulips.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's Dutch is all about the
flower industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over here in Colorado, California,
the States that are catching on,
[SPEAKER_05]: we want to grow dank robust plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand about full plant health.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're breeding for complete plant
structure, not just tulips.
[SPEAKER_06]: With most of the time I can pick out a
Dutch strain or genetics from Dutch or
[SPEAKER_06]: from Dutch from Amsterdam with,
I mean, roll a joint and smoke it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, put two or roll three joints,
put two American strains and one from
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guarantee I'll be able to pick out
the whitewashed just completely blended
[SPEAKER_06]: everything tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Berries and flowers, no bud structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go bash every Dutch seed
company, but I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I'm just hitting guys hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also avoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't shop here either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then ban this website.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I think the Dutch have kind of
wheat and you know, some American breeders
[SPEAKER_05]: are probably susceptible and guilty of it
also.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably bred because we wanted to
find, back in the day we didn't have a
[SPEAKER_05]: hyper pressure sodium lamp or an LED.
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably were using whatever finagle
lamp we can put together in the garage to
[SPEAKER_05]: make some space to try to create a 12-12
flower cycle out of the few seeds that we
[SPEAKER_05]: did get from whatever weed we got that we
didn't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: That some dude told us was tie stick,
but it was probably from Mexico,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we thought it was cooler to tell our
friends it was Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're growing these fucking
maybe tie stick, maybe Columbia,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe Jamaican seeds that could be males,
could be females, could be who knows what
[SPEAKER_05]: it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they got to figure out how to grow
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we may have gotten rid of the good shit
back in the day because we didn't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: right lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have the right knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just wanted something that finished
quick and didn't climb up into the lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew for three years before I ever saw a
clone or even made one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just did a bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would kill to have some of that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about how many, I used to buy
Mexican schwag weed back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I live, Mexican schwag weed was
$450, $500 a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could get a half ounce of seeds
out of it that looked like good,
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy, viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost wonder what I would have gotten
from them because you know, those Mexican
[SPEAKER_05]: crops weren't producing a low yielding
strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the lime green Christmas bud?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew out some seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did that come out?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was lime green Christmas bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was just, I guarantee that was like
Dutch genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Dutch auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was just, it was all right
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, 10 years ago would have went
fucking head over heels for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that you call it Christmas bud
because this town is known for getting the
[SPEAKER_05]: light green lime green Christmas bud right
around Christmas.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I know more about growing and
everything, I guarantee that's probably
[SPEAKER_06]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Late season auto flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of talk about the Mexican
cartels using auto flower strains so that
[SPEAKER_05]: they can keep stuff going year round.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about the one crop that was
busted in the forest near us that was all
[SPEAKER_05]: auto flowers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's how they do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those grows are cookie cutter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every single one of them is the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're in different locations,
but the way they grow, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: the cops, I can tell by looking at the
pictures most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the cops know, you know, the DEA,
there's just a certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fucking Billy and his crew are here
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're ever going to bust out a big
old grow that somewhere, find out what
[SPEAKER_06]: that is and grow just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some Mexican food, like buy your food
from the Mexican store with no English on
[SPEAKER_05]: the labels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just store a bunch of it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think that's what gives them the
first hint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, it's a bunch of, what did they
call them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican nationals is what they labeled
them as in the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We found tortillas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job police.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to get mad when I found seeds in my
weed, like pay good money for kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: There'd be seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like motherfuckers, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just paid, it's like a half a gram of
seeds in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm like, what happened to those
seeds that threw out the window?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I wish I had those when I was out in
California one time, the first time I was
[SPEAKER_06]: exposed to the whole medical marijuana
scene and everything kind of changed my
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke some OG Kush out there from my
then girlfriend's cousin that was full of
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds and I brought them back even.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just over move, moving from,
you know, over the years, I, lost them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, yeah, you'll find them on the
time is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully they're long gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to know you guys to talk about
my first experience with medical
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana, because I just, I've got a cool
fucking story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to tell it on this,
but it's another podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought about that.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a 4k room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all lined out all fucking now that
I'm a more experienced grower,
[SPEAKER_06]: like total Cali style, fucking flood and
drain tables, cool slabs and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fast track, it just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the, Oh man, all these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought about that room then,
like just how huge it was and how much
[SPEAKER_06]: money they must make and all that,
how much work it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I kind of chuckle, but yeah,
four lights, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally the first big fucking room I ever
saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to now when we, I remember the first
time that I walked into like a giant
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial grow, I had to like kind of
bite my lip and try to keep my face
[SPEAKER_05]: straight instead of shit in my pants and
getting a boner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now when I walk into big grows,
people still try to like the owner of a
[SPEAKER_05]: girl will walk in and they peek at you and
they try to read your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just try to keep that straight face
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, this is a cute grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: When sometimes I'm like, Oh my God,
there's 500 lights in this one room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, you guys don't take it for
granted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check out some cool grows and
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're jaded now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been to too many places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put too many hours in, in too many
facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in more facilities than I dare
to admit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been in half the facilities in this great
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little bit more about
compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to ask a couple other questions
also, but I just wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_05]: what was one of your, what's your favorite
shit to smoke?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were talking about seeds and I
had a strain in mind that I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_05]: you about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I wonder if he'll mention
that because it was a Pueblo favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's one of your favorites to smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen that shit in years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: P bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: The P 91.
[SPEAKER_06]: P 91.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: P buds, the Kim dog dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that I remember getting that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my favorite stuff to smoke nowadays is
just like, Oh geez.
Yetis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: The P 91 was amazing though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yetis a great stuff to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet the P 91 was related to like the
deep chunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pit bull and there's bull rider and
like Northern lights five, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could Google it if you want to make the
strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of thinking of bull riders in
Afghani and Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, I believe is the Indica
version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could be completely wrong by the
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's bull rider or pit bull,
which is they're similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a, it's from stony girl seeds is
who actually put that one out in seed
[SPEAKER_05]: form.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now there's another company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Gold Coast genetics,
maybe who I got the seeds from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: They charged me way too much, but for the
nostalgia, I was like, I need that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't I've been real.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hold the seeds like they're precious and
I want to pop them at the right time.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm expecting company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our good friend, Lindsey, the traveling
stoner and Bobo are coming over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobo Blasterco's birthday was a few days
ago and he got a sweet new rig from our
[SPEAKER_05]: friend's rebel glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take some dabs out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some time left.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to give you a warning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that when they, cause I just told them
to show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just going to walk in
eventually and we may either hand them a
[SPEAKER_05]: microphone or we'll wrap up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very informal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about composting until then.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to remember where we are at.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about getting it in a 40
gallon container.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got your worms living in newspaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got ground, chopped up phone books,
wood chunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barks, bark type stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine come free.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bokashi pulp, the Bokashi bucket pulp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I threw in some oyster shell and some
malted barley seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oyster shell just to give them some cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was told by a worm keeping friend
that oyster shell helps bulk the worms
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll make them fatter, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Make them eat more and make them work a
little harder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and part of my plan with this big worm
container is to release in my garden in
[SPEAKER_06]: the spring, early summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that I'm just, I'm building up the soil
in my garden year after year after year.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can dump, I mean, fuck 10,000 worms
or something like that, I might end up
[SPEAKER_06]: with shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just turn that soil all day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you and your dad go fishing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I don't use worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have fly fishermen, purists.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to just go sit there all
day?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to do something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, that's not really my type of
fishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we've got, we've gotten dope ass
compost now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to cut some of that 50%,
25% with regular soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's act like we're going to put it into
a potted plant to grow either indoors or
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much of that compost do you want to
use?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're building a soil from scratch,
I would recommend like 30, 40% compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to use that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I mean, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got that, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to top dress that or do you
want to blend it in when you start?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're building the soil, I would
totally recommend blending it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are top dressing, I would do,
I want to say like a quarter cup per
[SPEAKER_06]: gallon container.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you got a seven gallon, I would
recommend three and a half cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did the odd number to yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw you do the odd number.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I tell the guys at work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and if you're recharging the soil or
like reusing the soil, like Jeff does,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would probably say like 20%,
25% maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe even as low as 15, it kind of
depends on how much aeration your soil
[SPEAKER_06]: has.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to add any in,
or if, or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aeration is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, we learned our lesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put some plants into cocoa and I did not
put anything in there to aerate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those plants pretty much gave me the
middle finger their whole lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super compressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to fill that up with some perlite,
put something in there to kind of air it
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also make teas with your compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was what I was going to ask next.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with compost, make sure you,
you have a consistent temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been told, if you let it get too
warm, you can potentially have some funky
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff going on in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your tea or the compost itself?
[SPEAKER_06]: In your tea.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people talk crap about compost or
you'll find people that talk shit about
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things they claim is,
is, has E.
[SPEAKER_06]: coli in it, which it possibly could have
E.
[SPEAKER_06]: coli in it, but it also has a million
other things that are way nastier than E.
[SPEAKER_06]: coli that don't harm us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't a large percentage of your fruits
and vegetables have E.
[SPEAKER_05]: coli anyway, when you purchase them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trace them out at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're shipped.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So would that mean maybe not to use a
compost tea as a foliar feed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the way to get around that,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just feed it to the roots and not the
foliar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally would never use an actual
compost tea for foliar either.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would strictly save that for warm
castings.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Without a doubt.
All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the way to get around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No worry there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feed it to the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Magical happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: The E.
[SPEAKER_05]: coli goes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also with compost, you can make a
concentrate where just take your compost,
[SPEAKER_06]: put it in a cheesecloth, massage it in
water or underneath water for about 10
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like put it in a bucket of water and just
kind of rub it out a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I was going to, I was trying to
let that joke slide, but that's actually
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're rubbing it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need it like a loaf of bread.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perverts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that makes a compost or warm
casting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do either one, a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has a longer shelf life than an
aerated tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something I just learned.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can just, as you're taking old food
scraps and recycled dirt and putting it in
[SPEAKER_05]: a cheesecloth and squeezing it and making
your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop making waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop wasting shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop spending money on companies
that do not really support the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: movement or us or our wallets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's stop making trucks drive across the
country with bottles of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's, you're paying for water
when you buy whatever brand you use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Botanicare, but still every time I
buy a bottle of Pure Blend Pro or Liquid
[SPEAKER_05]: Karma, I had to pay a truck to drive that
shit from Arizona to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I had to pay some dude at a hydro
shot with a mullet to fucking unload it
[SPEAKER_05]: off the truck and then sell it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had to buy it home and measure
it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably could have just taken some kelp
and seabird guano, whatever the fuck else
[SPEAKER_05]: is in that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could have made my own probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even veg West Blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you want to grow salts,
you know, you could still be kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: environmentally friendly.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm getting at is I can make that
and I don't have to add to that truck
[SPEAKER_05]: driving, that emissions, the water being
shipped, the gas, the exhaust,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we could do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only that, you're diverting food
from going into the landfill.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're just... And basically money from
going right into the same landfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it back into your crop, back into your
wallet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're producing something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not depending on someone for that
little tiny bit of your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it only may be that part,
but I love, you know, trying to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: producer, not a consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may sound a little weird, but there's a
good feeling knowing that my vivacious
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy green vigorous cannabis plants are
on nearly the same diet as myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me think maybe other than all
this freaking Dr. Pepper I'm addicted to,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe I'm green and vivacious and vigorous
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeps me strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, dude, we've been going for like
40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything else you want to talk
about composting before we get a doorbell
[SPEAKER_05]: ringing and we get some new stoners
showing up?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we can wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can touch back later if anyone's got
any questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could easily talk more.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting good at podcasting by the
way, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're really comfortable now,
other than being a little cold in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm trying to build my schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a busy life that was all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always had a busy life, but you know,
a few months ago, it just all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_06]: like really stepped up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good, but it's bad for my podcast
and I have all these ideals and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: just plans and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to, adjust into my
schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Expect a kick-ass podcast coming from me
besides the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you got a new idea coming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to go with a, I'll go ahead
and, but it's going to be the high grade
[SPEAKER_06]: homestead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and it'll be more than just cannabis
growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about gardening and
chickens and all kinds of shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff you'd find on a homestead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you ever need a cannabis expert
on that show, I'll come be on your show
[SPEAKER_06]: planned out for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to the rest of the Colorado
podcast boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting me borrow Jesse for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also shout out to Bern.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting your husband come hang
out for a couple hours and get,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got him stupid high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to send him home even higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still on the, I haven't really been
dabbing diet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's another dab waiting with
your name on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just waiting to finish this show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to be as coherent as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bern also takes great care of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to the hydro shop, she's always
excited to see me.
[SPEAKER_05]: She gives me a big hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's super friendly and she is great
customer service.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to Bern.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting me borrow your husband
for an hour or two to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to hearing the high grade
homestead.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of letters to put in my
brain, but I look forward to hearing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope my listeners follow you on that
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they're going to follow you on
Instagram at Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're also going to check out the
Colorado podcast Instagram page while
[SPEAKER_05]: they're at it.

[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you for joining me on the
podcast where you've been here for two
[SPEAKER_05]: hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do a couple of wrap ups.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you find me on all the social
media guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the girl from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you know, I would love it if you go
to iTunes and leave me a rating and a
[SPEAKER_05]: review.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you know how to find the ratings
and reviews by now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody so far has given me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it'd be cool if you follow suit,
but if you feel like you want to be
[SPEAKER_05]: different, do what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, let me remind you about a new
service I've signed up for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is called Patreon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon is a service that will allow my
listeners to make a financial contribution
[SPEAKER_05]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they feel so inclined, if you feel like
the information or knowledge or friendship
[SPEAKER_05]: I have provided you, or just you want to
throw some money around, go to patreon.com
[SPEAKER_05]: slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that will allow you to do is sign
up to contribute a monthly contribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can contribute as little as $1.
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly don't think there's a limit to
the amount of zeros you can add to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So however many zeros you want to add to
that dollar sign, go ahead, put a one,
[SPEAKER_05]: put a five, put a nine in front of there,
however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I would appreciate though.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you sign up for Patreon, you can
contribute $1 to the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will charge you every, the first of
every month.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that will send that right over to
my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I'm not trying to make a
bunch of money off my friends and my
[SPEAKER_05]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: What that will do, that will help me pay
for the cost of my website.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, iregeneticscolorado.com cost me
about $315 per year to keep up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is how I deliver you this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to offset that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to pay for that out of my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not begging either.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you would like to go to Patreon,
go check it out, patreon.com slash grow
[SPEAKER_05]: from your heart.

[SPEAKER_05]: I did it even.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Jesse did do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse was my second contributor to

[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to all three of the people
who have contributed to my Patreon so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate all three of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if everybody wants to be

[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you can't contribute to Patreon,
you guys, I love you and I appreciate you
[SPEAKER_05]: just for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to give me money.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to give me anything to be
my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you being there and
supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I extra especially support.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I had a lot of caffeine and
dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brain's going too fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I appreciate you for supporting
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said earlier, I completely
trust you or thank you for trusting me to
[SPEAKER_05]: be your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like I need to wrap up the show
because my tongue is tying itself in a
[SPEAKER_05]: damn knot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think all I have to say now is a big
shout out to my friend, the Barefoot
[SPEAKER_05]: Grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_05]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_05]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_05]: I may be getting a head cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something sounds a little muffly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, listeners, if it's muffly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's just my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it in your head or is it in the gear?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm thinking it's in the headphones
because the music sounds good,
[SPEAKER_05]: but my voice sounds stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize for that, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get over it and we're going
to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining me, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.

out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that, Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun meeting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one time we got to meet at Candy
Canyon, and I can't wait till we run into
[SPEAKER_01]: each other again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will get you guys here together on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She will get you high as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Granny's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The basket of magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The basket, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Granny and her basket of magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Granny got to meet Action Bronson the
other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the coolest photos I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Davin Granny and Action Bronson.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to Davin Granny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, since we're doing shout outs,
I need to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_05]: friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys need any sort of t-shirt
printing, some stickers, some hat pins,
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys, I fully endorse and support my
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out handmadeapparel.biz or check
them out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a Facebook group and a Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, they printed me some Grow From
Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've printed my iRegenetics t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a bright red handmade apparel
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a green handmade apparel hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got hat pins.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got stickers that these folks made,
and everything is top quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made in America by Americans.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made by Dab Kids who take dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They dab just as hard as you and I do,
so I think it's great to support the
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great to support our friends
that are doing this with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like these people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good friends of mine, and they
make great shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please support them as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade for all your printing needs,
and get that sweet handmade apparel logo
[SPEAKER_05]: on the side of your shirt like I've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could all be in the same handmade gang.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to the handmade crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, go to
handmadeapparel.biz and check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some stuff printed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, shirts that are printed with
logos and stuff, the logo goes first.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my handmade stuff, the shirt is
going a little before the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The logo still looks fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not thrown any of them away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been rocking these t-shirts for
probably five years now, and from the
[SPEAKER_05]: first one, I have not thrown it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: The logo is still crispy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shirt, however, is getting that black
shirt dinged to it, but the logo looks
[SPEAKER_05]: like it was freshly painted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can only hold up for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've beaten the living hell out of mine,
and the logo still looks fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sweet shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we've given them a huge shout
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big thanks to my friends at Handmade
Apparel for all the stuff they've printed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, they have the best rates for hat
pins.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're getting your hat pins made,
go through Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried a lot of companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade Apparel was the most reliable.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do the artwork in-house, and they
have the pins made, so it's all one group.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to have different people
working together and fucking you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do great artwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big hugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that stuff to our friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you check them out,
HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've said that enough times.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you want to chatter about
before we get into our main topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, do you want to jump into the- It
feels like so much has happened since the
[SPEAKER_01]: last time I was on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of stuff's happened since the
election.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably just dive right into
the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start off with the letter from the
DEA that came out just a couple of days
[SPEAKER_05]: ago, and then if we have time for it,
we will do a couple of election updates
[SPEAKER_05]: because I know you love getting to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listeners have asked for longer lessons.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was me clapping.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't clap like I wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of listeners are like, hey,
bro, I want a longer episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I've taken on a new project.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't talk a lot about this project that
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kept it on the down low, but it keeps
me busy for 45 or 50 hours a week,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I haven't been doing two podcast
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do my best to get longer
episodes, and I know that the past couple
[SPEAKER_05]: episodes have been a little not as
informative.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was over fucking well, and you guys,
it's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's super busy right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've got a kiddo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing a new project.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hanging out with my mom earlier
today for quite some time talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas presents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just wrapped a killer outdoor grow
session again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Jesse for coming and
helping us do some outdoor grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that series every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I got to pack so much info
into every single episode though.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I don't give a full informative
episode, I feel like I'm cheating myself
[SPEAKER_05]: and the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are episodes where I've had to stop
and pause repeatedly while I take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so hyper detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got those podcasts in the works,
the ones we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got the folder right here in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hear this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all those pages shuffling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one gets more impressive every week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm going to do those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to perfect them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are episodes that are going to be in
depth, and I'm a perfectionist,
[SPEAKER_05]: so when they come out like that,
they're really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this episode, we're going to talk
about… You like how I pulled that
[SPEAKER_05]: background?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been podcasting a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this podcast, we're going to talk about
a letter that the DEA sent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who the hell did they send it to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they just publish it or was it
actually mailed to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the big dust up this week,
the letter that everyone freaked out about
[SPEAKER_01]: over CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did your face just break?
[SPEAKER_01]: This story almost broke me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big dust up is basically saying the
DEA just made CBD illegal again,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's silly because it was never
legal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read this article, and then we're
definitely going to talk about why it's
[SPEAKER_05]: silly, and we'll talk about a lot of
details.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of different versions of
this article.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main part that I want to focus on is a
quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: This story is a great example of just how
fake news can be in the different degrees
[SPEAKER_05]: of bullshit that can work their way into a
press story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read it in three or four different
locations, and the part I want to focus on
[SPEAKER_05]: is mainly quoted from the DEA themselves,
so that can't be wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the buffers around it, we can talk
shit about a lot on every website.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, I chose the one… The Leafley
article looked like a crock of shit to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like the Leafley article,
so I chose to go with the article from the
[SPEAKER_05]: Green Rush Daily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Green Rush Daily.
[SPEAKER_05]: The headline is, the DEA just banned CBD,
and here's why.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's a giant ad, and then I
finally scroll like seven scrolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I get to the article, it says,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one that wanted to talk shit about
an article, and I can't speak English
[SPEAKER_05]: words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Debilitating is the word I was trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I nailed cannabinoid and cannabidiol,
but I can't say debilitating, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mouthful, especially on a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially after all those dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dabs never help with reading aloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may be the exception to that rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an introvert, and then sometimes when
I smoke a lot of dabs, I get chatty,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I want to go for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, So why is the DEA putting it on
the list of the most harmful drugs
[SPEAKER_05]: available to man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the same reasons they temporarily
banned the herbal pain reliever kratom
[SPEAKER_05]: earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're both alternatives to more
dangerous prescription opiates that are
[SPEAKER_05]: plaguing the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DEA actions seem to protect big
pharma's pockets more than the health of
[SPEAKER_05]: American citizens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the point that I wanted to get
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about a conspiracy that I
agree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing so well, and then they
went off into fucktard land.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fucktard land was somewhere I wanted
to venture into later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to jump right into
Tartville, because I think that maybe has
[SPEAKER_05]: something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They see that there are pharmaceutical
companies working with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want us having that market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to corner that before we do,
so they're just going to shut us down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh no, you can't even play.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we win.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just landed on free parking by
fucking us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: The archaic spelling of the word marijuana
with an H is used in the federal register
[SPEAKER_05]: announcing the rule, probably to avoid
turning up in marijuana-related search
[SPEAKER_05]: results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just how the fucking feds spell
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking conspiracy, fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you said Green Rush Daily,
I was like, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said there's a big ad at the
top, and I went, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew where this was going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think this will be helpful for our
listeners, because those are two ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: spot fake news.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how the feds spell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what a lot of the fake news is
oriented around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, everybody has heard of CBD by
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast to coast is CBD's household term
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have seen through Sanjay Gupta's
specials and through YouTube videos and
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook posts how helpful it can be with
Parkinson's, with seizure disorders,
[SPEAKER_01]: with DeVay syndrome, with pain management.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the change in federal policy with the
Ogden Memo and the Cole Memo that led to
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana markets like we have here in
Colorado where they're legal, some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those like Colorado's included legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so last year, the year before the
feds, just like the Cole and Ogden Memos
[SPEAKER_01]: did for high THC cannabis, they put out a
little blurb in the farm bill covering
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp and putting a definition
for what industrial hemp is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so under the guise of that legal
loophole, a number of companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: both domestic and foreign, started selling
CBD extract online in all 50 states,
[SPEAKER_01]: making it available pretty much
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies like CBD Lifewater have sprung
up that are trying to get distribution in
[SPEAKER_01]: all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's under a gray market loophole
created by the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in no way legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds have always considered every part
of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if it's sativa,
indica, hemp, ruderalis, they don't give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump in right there because that's
right where I am in this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they spell it marijuana with an H.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these laws are based in fucking
racism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a lot of where the original
basis for these comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the feds write a new marijuana,
law, it's on the backs of all the old
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana laws and they keep the same
racist ass spelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff's giving me a look like I know of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me finish the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fired up and I like it,
but I have to get through this article to
[SPEAKER_05]: make the show a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the reason given that the US is
complying with the international drug
[SPEAKER_05]: control treaties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, the reason giving is that the,
okay, it says that they are complying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the DEA's stated reason for the change
this week is to help them comply with
[SPEAKER_01]: international narcotics treaties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then they say before this
elaboration, CBD's legality was in a gray
[SPEAKER_05]: area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was assumed that CBD extracted from
medical cannabis was only legal for
[SPEAKER_05]: medical marijuana patients and illegal to
the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, CBD derived from industrial hemp
was being sold across the country as if it
[SPEAKER_05]: were federally legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently the DEA has always
believed any form of cannabis extract to
[SPEAKER_05]: be schedule one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I want to, if I handed you a CBD
molecule, a scientist to CBD molecule,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I said, did this come from hemp or
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd probably tell me to go fuck myself
because it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would say it's a molecule.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the DEA claims that there are small
amounts of cannabinoids in every CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: They cite this as another reason to keep
CBD on schedule one.
[SPEAKER_05]: For practical purposes, all extracts that
contain CBD will also contain at least
[SPEAKER_05]: small amounts of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if it were possible to produce
the form of cannabis plant, sorry,
[SPEAKER_05]: they wrote this weird and there's an ad
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm skipping through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Produced from the cannabis plant,
an extract that contained only CBD and no
[SPEAKER_05]: other cannabinoids, such an extract would
fall within the new drug code.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically the DEA made extracting CBD
completely illegal, whether it's from hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: or not, whether it is pure CBD,
because they are wrong right there when
[SPEAKER_05]: they say that you can't get pure CBD
because I know thinking, counting,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can put five fingers up and confidently
say that I know five people that I could
[SPEAKER_05]: call friends that can make CBD isolate
that is 99.8 or 9% CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one or 2% is atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are things like oxygen in there that
they cannot control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get 100% pure CBD, lots of
different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA's position on it doesn't have
anything to do with there being trace
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something that happened to
mumble during the press conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always been, CBD has always been
illegal just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every part of the cannabis plant is
illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds are illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root ball is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pot you grew it in is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if it's industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year, or just to be safe,
every 18 months, some drug task force
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere like East Palm Fuck,
Texas makes the announcement that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: just found the world's biggest pot farm
and they're raiding it today and they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't catch any growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's headline news on Monday and it's
headline news on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's nothing about it in the press
on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next Friday, it comes out that it was a
wild hemp field on some farmers back 400
[SPEAKER_01]: acres in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather conditions that spring were
perfect for feral hemp to go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA will spend $100,000 ripping all of
that feral hemp out of the ground and
[SPEAKER_01]: burning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's the dangerous marijuana
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter that it's growing wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have any TFC in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you smoked any of that stuff,
if you harvested, dried and cured it
[SPEAKER_05]: properly, all that shit would do is give
you a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an Indian reservation,
I want to say it was in New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere hot and kind of miserable to
live, where feral hemp was just
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd found a way to basically build
whole houses with it, with hemp creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of other products and they were
doing it all on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds would show up every now and again
and burn their hemp down because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA wastes small fortunes,
ripping wild hemp plants out of the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: that are left over from the 30s and 40s
when hemp was grown as a crop all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: US.
[SPEAKER_05]: When there's a terrible heroin epidemic
everywhere right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado Springs is littered with crystal
meth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meth is everywhere in Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are driving around on bicycles
looking at fucking trash cans all over
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pueblo is dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Friday night right now, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Friday night at 1030.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the people that used to be out raging,
doing heroin, not all, but a good fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: portion of our young people are out doing
heroin right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DEA is worried about fucking with
plants that keep us cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun cannabis that gets you stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp, the stuff you make jeans with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Houses, bricks, textiles, necklaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an infinite number of products you
can make with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was part of the reason they included
the exemption in the farm bill last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: the year before, to designate what exactly
is industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody, I mean everybody,
everybody understands how absurd our hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: laws are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as law enforcement's concerned,
cops can't tell the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pretty sure you can grow the
two next to each other so you can hide
[SPEAKER_01]: your high THC plants among your hemp
plants, which anyone that's ever grown
[SPEAKER_01]: either crop knows how insane that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But law enforcement across the country
still argue shit like that in federal
[SPEAKER_01]: court to keep the DEA making decisions
like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them can be very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends what the hemp you're growing
has been bred to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I understand what Sunsal's doing,
is they're producing CBD extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like flow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grows just like flow in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the type of hemp you would want for
a high CBD extract production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm guessing that hemp strain would be
crap if they tried to make fuel oil or
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not fibrous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and that's one of the great things
about cannabis is it can be bred one way
[SPEAKER_01]: or the other to achieve an infinite number
of final products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the feds are concerned,
every single part of it's illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only legal hemp or marijuana products
that are federally legal in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States are hemp clothing produced in other
countries or produced from fabric that was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly lotions and hemp seed oils and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, products that were produced with
plant material grown in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is at least a gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA and a couple other national safety
organizations released a thing we even did
[SPEAKER_01]: a blurb about it on the show about the
foreign companies selling God knows what
[SPEAKER_01]: is CBD extract or CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were testing it and it didn't have a
lot of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it did, but it had a lot of other
crap in it you didn't want along with it
[SPEAKER_01]: is filler.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get in a gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lot of knockoff products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lot of mislabeled products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I've been freaking out
about getting people politically active.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think they're doing this for their
own financial gain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think the pharmaceutical companies
are planning something with CBD products?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple in Great Britain and
around the country that are already
[SPEAKER_01]: working with THC CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: GW Pharmaceuticals is working a couple of
different product lines, but they're still
[SPEAKER_01]: five, 10 years from market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that the pharmaceutical industry
don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an industry, I'm sure they would prefer
to have control of all medications that
[SPEAKER_01]: people take, but that's not physically
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to make me better.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to mask my symptoms and keep
feeding me a pill to make me a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And greed is the one conspiracy theory
you're going to get me to buy into
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with a decision like this,
this is just business as usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the exact same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this has been true since 1940.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are freaking out about this
decision today because they issued it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an own serial number, so they can
track the Caesars separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I encourage the move because
tracking shit separately is helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, any anti-marijuana group is
going to tell you that 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years ago, the average THC content in
marijuana was one to 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can back that up with DEA seizure
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that's true is because
they've been seizing fields of fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: feral hemp every year for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's always been illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracking it separately helps us figure
out, okay, exactly how much did they waste
[SPEAKER_01]: ripping up hemp out of the ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money did they waste making sure
Kansas didn't get their hemp seed last
[SPEAKER_01]: year?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money did they waste rounding up
hemp seed or hemp oil off the internet?
[SPEAKER_05]: Off the side of the highway as you drive
to New Mexico?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: These companies that are shipping CBD,
I don't know if I want to say anybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: names.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get any people in trouble,
but I know people personally, and there
[SPEAKER_05]: are companies in Colorado that will ship
CBD products nationwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be in Maine, California,
and they will send you a bottle of CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are those people that were relying on
those medicine?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they going to do now?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I'm mainly worried about.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their access was only obtained through
a gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they were paying attention,
they knew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been lobbying for a different
way to access whatever product they
[SPEAKER_01]: desperately need in their area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to say come to Colorado and
we've got CBD for you, but there is a CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: drought and the only way... Everybody
thinks they're going to come to Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: and go to a medical dispensary and get
high CBD medicine, and they are highly
[SPEAKER_05]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not much CBD medicine available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much and what's available is
expensive because there's a shortage and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been a shortage for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to find yourself a private
caregiver who they're trying to squeeze
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the system now anyway, or you've
got to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got to find a CBD clone,
or you've got to find seeds of something
[SPEAKER_05]: high CBD, and then you've got to grow it
and then you've got to get it tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: People focus a little bit too much on
testing when it comes to personal
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do an episode on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to write this down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if medicine works for you,
it works for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't pay attention to the lab testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of elaboration I want to
do on that, but we'll save it for
[SPEAKER_05]: another...
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff that lab testing
brought to the community that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: bizarre.
[SPEAKER_01]: People focus on all the wrong numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved watching the CBD industry explode
over the last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take that from what I'm saying,
because I think that should be available
[SPEAKER_01]: to everyone everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the society would be a lot better
if more people were adding CBD to their
[SPEAKER_01]: diets regularly as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge CBD advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it daily.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your daily dose of CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm restricting myself because
the product I'm using, I'm limited on
[SPEAKER_01]: accessing any more of it ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That won't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person that's making it is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making it last.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always the worst part about these
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm at two or three CBD dabs a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I space them throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not hurting that day, maybe I'll
only take one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll take just a little itty bitty
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll just use some of the pain cream
I've got left instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm purposefully going slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was taking it as milligram pills,
it was 50 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 in the morning, 25 at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_05]: 25 to keep you pain free at day,
25 to get you sleeping through the night
[SPEAKER_05]: comfortably.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just making it easy because I never
went wild with it because I like it half
[SPEAKER_01]: and half THC CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to be eating 50 milligrams
of THC before I went out into the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was keeping it to 25 and then adding
more during the day if I needed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can consume huge amounts of CBD when I'm
hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an issue with two of the
vertebrae in my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen often, but every now and
then they twang off each other like a
[SPEAKER_01]: rubber band.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feeling is pretty excruciating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the area around where those two twang
will get inflamed and hurt for several
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a degree where I can't really bend or
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I feel it's twang and I eat a whole
bunch of CBD, like 300 milligrams right
[SPEAKER_01]: away, it won't inflame to the point where
I'm down the next day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot about if you get on it as
soon as you feel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as you feel it, get that CBD
edible in you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can, take a dab because dab is-
It's instant absorption.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dab is instant effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just dabbing, but any inhalation
through the lungs, that makes it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bloodstream incredibly quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get relief in seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, it's seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat it, you're looking at half
hour, hour, hour and a half, two hours
[SPEAKER_01]: before you've got full effect of what
you've consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect of what you eat is going to be
a little stronger, but that delayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking it for pain, you can't
wait two hours for your pain pill to kick
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was never legal in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how you looped that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just called that back like a
professional comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a loophole that everybody was
operating under.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so glaringly obvious a loophole
that Chinese companies dove all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that was going to get shut down
at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even what this was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just the DEA assigning its own
serial number for when they do seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even release a letter saying,
we're going to go after the people selling
[SPEAKER_01]: this shit online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a reminder that all parts of the
cannabis plant are illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our community is still not
politically aware, let alone politically
[SPEAKER_01]: active.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I bring you on, Mike,
because you can remind them and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: try to blow up the fucking- Huge segments
of the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the marijuana community got this
story wrong, freaked out about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tying it to every conspiracy
theory there is against marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read on a fairly reputable news site,
it was an opinion piece that they chose to
[SPEAKER_01]: publish about because they use the
marijuana with an H spelling in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was because Trump was elected and
racism is now openly accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an indication that the DEA was
going to round up the Stoners and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading this like, Jesus, we've come
so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had a huge night on election
night, marijuana won big in so many
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we do to celebrate is give
ourselves a black eye, and then another,
[SPEAKER_01]: and another, and another, and another,
and another.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't need a fake new shit storm this
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough real news that we should be
focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so much of our community isn't
aware of the legalities nationally for
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant we all love, this story is
spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen half a dozen businesses down
here post it, and it's like, you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have known this better than
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The businesses, the CBD businesses that
were sending this shit through the mail,
[SPEAKER_01]: their lawyers should have made this
perfectly clear to them that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in a legal gray area through a
loophole in a fucking farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that as far as the feds are concerned,
all parts of the cannabis plant are
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal, regardless of THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be just the root ball of a hemp
plant that dried up or was harvested two
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, and it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still be charged for the federal
crime for having it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the reality of our
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I have so much respect for even
the marijuana business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hate because they're standing up
and risking a lot for us, for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to everyone in the marijuana
industry, working hard every day,
[SPEAKER_05]: getting it going.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've talked a lot about this DEA
letter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that clears that up and calms
you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send your hate mail to neumobunk15 on
Twitter or at Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the positive stuff can grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for listening to the DEA part.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to move on to a little bit of
updating stuff of things that we've talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about in the past because on our postal
election episode, we mentioned that a- It
[SPEAKER_01]: was the little bit of bad news we had for
Pueblo for our election night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a election question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we allow retail marijuana stores
inside Pueblo city limits?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it called on the ballot?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that initiative?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an initiative?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what I voted on?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the thing I voted on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Initiative amendment.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a couple of- Initiative was the
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was trying to- I honestly don't
remember which one this was.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was one- Ballot question is how
I tend to defer to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We thought it did not pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we recorded our post election show,
it was failing by 150 or 200 votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time they got all of the
provisional ballots counted and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: ballots that were stuck together and
whatnot counted, we won by five or 600
[SPEAKER_01]: votes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will be able to have recreational
cannabis stores within the city limits of
[SPEAKER_05]: Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_01]: December 27th, I believe the city council
is the Tuesday after Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: City council will be voting on the final
rules and regs package for rec shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they're in a good mood after their
Christmas break.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they get what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I've been involved with
this for a long time, so I know way more
[SPEAKER_01]: about it than I should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the people that are working on it
right now, I probably know more about it
[SPEAKER_01]: than they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance that they're about to vote
in probably pass into law was written by a
[SPEAKER_01]: zoning commission that was very dead set
against allowing marijuana businesses in
[SPEAKER_01]: the city at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a certain point, they discovered
that with one or two zoning buffer rules,
[SPEAKER_01]: so 1,000 feet from schools and 300 feet
from residences, that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially limit the number of marijuana
businesses in the city to about a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's all the property that's
physically available if they include those
[SPEAKER_01]: two buffer zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to make that even more restrictive,
they've decided to limit the total number
[SPEAKER_01]: of stores in the city to eight,
four north of the river, four south of the
[SPEAKER_01]: river.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city is preparing for a wave of
applications and they've come up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: point system and a timeline for that
application process to take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully by the end of the year,
we've got at least a couple of retail
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana shops open in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish the rules that we're about to pass
are different, but that's very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing what I can to get some of the
craziness taken out of them, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: only so much change that they're willing
to make right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very different city council than
the one we had a year or two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a process that started
four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been four full years that the city
has been working on this particular set of
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how long I've been working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think since we had the first shop,
do you think we could get just first in
[SPEAKER_05]: line?
[SPEAKER_05]: Be like, hey, can we be back?
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, just play that card.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be like, hey, we was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of that part of the city is blacked
out due to schools because the thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: foot from schools rule isn't just
classrooms where there are students.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the college owns an empty apartment on
whatever street, then there's a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: foot buffer around that empty apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around that empty apartments property
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the library in such count?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for this rule package.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tends not to matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several other buffer zones
listed around our medical shops,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why they've been allowed with no
store cap for four or five years and we
[SPEAKER_01]: only have three.
[SPEAKER_01]: With zoning rules, you can really limit
the allowed businesses in an area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why if your area passed
legalization recently, you really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: brush up on local politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get down to planning and zoning in city
council or county commission meetings now
[SPEAKER_01]: because these rules are being decided for
your area right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not involved, people who do give
a shit enough to show up, it's their voice
[SPEAKER_01]: that helps grasp these rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's two people that really hate weed
for one reason or another, and one person
[SPEAKER_01]: that loves weed but is really
inarticulate, expect ugly rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know how to grow and you were all
about talking with city council,
[SPEAKER_05]: go down there, represent them,
tell them why their guidelines aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: going to work for a typical grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I cannot recall buying cannabis in
a Pueblo dispensary since the legalization
[SPEAKER_05]: of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last time I can remember
shopping in a Pueblo dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I rarely shop in a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure to get out to the stores as
often as possible just to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as supply goes, I'm not all
that different than you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know you're a caregiver and he
does a good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: This cascade shatter is testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cough was brought to you by our
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also our good friends at Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the good Pueblo news that
we screwed up on election night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our big blooper from that show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing I've got written down,
you can see it, it says Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to tell us about Maine,
go for it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine voted to legalize recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the vote passed by a very,
very, very, very slim margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like statewide, it was like 1,500,
1,200 votes or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very, very close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the anti-pop people forced a recount
costing the state half a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That recount is underway now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's paused for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've counted all of the cities in
county areas that the anti-pop people were
[SPEAKER_01]: sure we're going to give them the numbers
to reverse the vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the outcome hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization is still winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the really funny part of the story to
me is, so in Maine, the election rules,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you push for a recount and you get it,
the pro side and the anti side for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever issue is getting recounted have
to send 10 volunteers every day to the
[SPEAKER_01]: recount office.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still costs the state half a million
dollars to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with using volunteers from the
campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the anti-pop people in Maine can't get
10 people to show up every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the recount's taken a lot longer
than it should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Election staffers have had to stand in and
cover for anti-legalization volunteers
[SPEAKER_01]: that weren't able to make it on time or
were late several days or a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: in a row when this first started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just happened again here at the end
of the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have enough people show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, the pro pop people have had extra
volunteers willing to work and have been
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to work some longer hours to make
sure that this gets recounted correctly
[SPEAKER_01]: and accurately so that the recount is
still on track to finish up when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the anti-pop people were so convinced
that they had this in the bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: so convinced that they had the majority of
people that they forced the recount and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half million of taxes to be spent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't even get 10 volunteers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total election-wide, there's a bunch,
but it's all little stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's statewide issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there aren't that many that are
still counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recounting is a huge process because it's
done by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Maine, the 10 people from each side
pair up, and then they're given an
[SPEAKER_01]: election person, and then those three
people go to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at the ballot, and both of
the pro and the anti people agree that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a yes vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third guy from the election
commission is there to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: anti and the pro people don't fight,
and that they play nice and follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it takes an insane amount of time
on a election night, they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: funneling these fuckers through a machine,
and you can do thousands a minute or
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're Pueblo and you crash your
fucking shitty circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the recount is an incredibly taxing
process, but there aren't that many that
[SPEAKER_01]: are still going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically by now, one side has gone,
okay, the vote clearly hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're down to just the tiny towns or the
areas that voted strongly one way or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've conceded at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anti pot thing, or the anti pot group
in Maine is one of the few holdouts that
[SPEAKER_01]: are still fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this means, if you happen to
listen to the podcast and you live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine way, first shout out for listening,
we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, get involved locally because in a
couple of weeks, when all this is said and
[SPEAKER_01]: done and it's official and marijuana is
legal, at best, you're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to local government officials who will be
saying over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, the vote was really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hear what both sides are saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give the anti pot people
nine out of the 10 things they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to give the pro marijuana
people one out of the 10 things they want
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was a close vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't get on top of it now and
figure out exactly how these rules get
[SPEAKER_01]: made in your area, you're going to be
driving a really long distance to the only
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be crazy expensive to
buy weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly have no idea exactly how big
that state is, but I don't want to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 minutes to the weed store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to drive 20 minutes to the
weed store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you got to drive 45 minutes home
before you can smoke that new weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just gave me a nostalgic feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when you used to go to the
dispensary?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm jaded, but I remember the feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I apologize for the chokes while
Mike was on his rant there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember you used to go to the dispensary
and you'd be like, oh, you want one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a dab tool or a carb cap
tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just don't use that email because it's
kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it to be quiet and not use a torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a rig with a bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to our friends at Elevate for
keeping me stocked up on fresh bangers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Quince Bangers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that feeling when you would go to
the, like, I would, I would do,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of a nerd.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do research online and find out
what the hottest strains are in Denver or
[SPEAKER_05]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would go find that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was a Bruce Banner, I'd go find
where they had some Bruce Banner.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the strain that they had at the
Denver relief?
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they got the biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Vortex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vortex.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from TGA Subcool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to the clinic on Mexico in
Denver and I was getting the Vortex wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say, how much do you have of
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd say this much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd say, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They started setting limits because of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started setting purchase limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember the first week they put
those purchase limits in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls screwed up when we were there
and we still bought it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Brittany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a hookup like a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually when I bought my Hitman
rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, so I remember the feeling I would get
when I would leave the dispensary with
[SPEAKER_05]: that specific strain that I was so excited
about going to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you're like skipping.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like almost the feeling when I was a
little kid and I'd get a new video game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever the new Zelda or Super Mario came
out and I'm like, oh, I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to go home and show my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd go home and call one of your
buddies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the same thing would happen
with weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd go home and call your friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, bro, Mike, you got to come
over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some biodiesel, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to come check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd drive over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd try to keep that jar closed until
you got here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that when I cracked it open,
it was just biodiesel in the face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'd grind a little bit of it up
and smoke it together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'd be like that anticipation from
the car to the house of like, oh God,
[SPEAKER_05]: just Mike, meet me at the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't even make me wait, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss the drive home from picking up weed
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that was like an hour and 20 minute
drive, that was stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like by the time you got home,
that adrenaline high.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not allowed to take more dads on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that adrenaline high from driving home
with a bag of weed and then sitting down
[SPEAKER_01]: grinding it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the sweet reward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I finally made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, I felt like I almost,
it was more of a reward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to get higher than like,
cause you had that like, oh, I fucking did
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went, cause it used to be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be a mission, a stoner mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would have to find, do you have weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: There'd be two or three guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be that first guy you'd always want
to try.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was my friend with bad eyes and his
name started with a J.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're, if you're in my crew,
you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit that guy first all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: See if he's got that sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'd try a couple other dudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you got to find out where they are,
if they got what you want, and if they can
[SPEAKER_05]: meet you somewhere, then you got to meet
up somewhere and you got to sit in a
[SPEAKER_05]: sketchy parking lot or go to a sketchy
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you got to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had three or four people and on
my way to work, I would hit up my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by lunch, if I ain't heard back,
I would hit up the other two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of the day, guaranteed one
of them would have hit me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd go wait in the sketchy
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't miss those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of miss that extra high from the
adrenaline and the drive and the
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipation, but I feel it every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I do hit a dispensary now,
or even when I come over and pick up from
[SPEAKER_01]: my caregiver, when I get back in the car,
there's no like, where am I going to put
[SPEAKER_01]: this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, oh man, this is dank as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was the other day when I picked up
from my caregiver, the last time when I
[SPEAKER_01]: got in the car, I was like, is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inside is a proper packaging inside my
shoulder bag in the back seat of my car is
[SPEAKER_01]: still stinking out the whole cab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, this is when the
adrenaline really kicks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You roll all the windows down and drive
home in 20 degree weather anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: You make that meeting with the dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as that bag and money exchanges,
now you're like, fuck, I just went from
[SPEAKER_05]: like, got to get this, got to find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the deal going to go smooth too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I got to get this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This shit home, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or somewhere or to whoever's house we're
partying in tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you got to make that drive and
your heart starts going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you see a cop.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you're going to do is fucking see a
cop.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could be going the other way 90 to 90
miles an hour and you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck the cops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to like check yourself and be
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the time you do get home and you
start getting that grin, you get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You park the car because you're not going
to get pulled over once you park the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: You pretty much got home.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take the keys out and you're like,
Oh, and by the time you unlock the door,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're almost, you can, your hands start
doing the grinder motion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm going to grind this weed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time you light it, your heart
is like in this special place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that first puff just puts you like,
it's like a mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you just rescued the fucking
princess.
[SPEAKER_05]: That princess was sweet Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nostalgic for it, but I wouldn't give,
go back to it for all the money in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's nothing that could get me to
go back to having to do a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love getting, I mean, on the off chance
I get pulled over and I've got weed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love being a vertigo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there weed in the car?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got pulled over and the cop was 10
feet from my car before he goes,
[SPEAKER_05]: sir, do you have marijuana in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he could smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just looked him straight in the face
and I said, yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably some weed in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to even try to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was, once I said yes, that cop was
like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got pulled over leaving a big production
grow that I was trimming at for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, I didn't have anything on me,
but I probably had like eight or nine
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of just like marijuana juice,
not oil or extract or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like just the pulp from the family
stem, like just in my shoes, just soaked
[SPEAKER_01]: in through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stunk to high heaven because I've
been trimming for like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, are we in the car?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I work in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been harvesting all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that I stink to high heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, what's your all clear
ride and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just see your badge and your
driver's license and your other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me run your, your car information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good to have a nice night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, just so you know, I can smell
you like four cars day like behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, I knew someone in front of me was
just stanking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like silver as a judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Working all day harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really smell that bartender friend
who's been pulled over several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I swear to God officer,
what you're smelling right now is my
[SPEAKER_01]: socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I work at a bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to hate that as a musician.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I did drink it for plenty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I drank fucking plenty, but I learned not
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'd be at the club cleaning up
or whatever and somebody'd spill some beer
[SPEAKER_05]: on you or on your equipment or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're in the car and it just reeks
that beer smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be driving home like, fuck,
I smell like beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's so nice that it was literally
the only part of my life where I was way
[SPEAKER_01]: out of whack with legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been kicked out of
restaurants or denied service.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't even kick me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just like, no, why don't you guys
go take a shower and come back?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had someone walk up and they went to do
the, so table for three and they went,
[SPEAKER_01]: so take out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carry out at the skirted heifer in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't going to say the name of a
restaurant, but I'm like, I don't blame
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire trim crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was, I, we were going to dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were trimming and put down the trim to
go to dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was four of us that were working at
caregiver gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like, we didn't have any of the like
protective layering that you wear at a
[SPEAKER_01]: production facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had like trim mashed into our shoes
and like stuck to our feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that facility, we pretty much sat
around the table, just like this in our
[SPEAKER_05]: t-shirts and shorts and trimmed with
rubber gloves on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would go smoke at a friend's
house because we had a friend that lived
[SPEAKER_05]: between the grow and downtown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to stop over there at the
apartment, get wrecked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we drove right to the food place
and we go like, Hey, we need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go, you guys are going to eat
outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, no, your table is
outside guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like four degrees out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our high ass is all eight outside
because they wouldn't let us sit inside
[SPEAKER_05]: the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the place was filled with families.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could see people looking at us
offended, like I can smell your weed over
[SPEAKER_05]: the burgers in the skirted heifer and
listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: The skirted heifer serves a quinoa burger
that is marvelous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what you do for work all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're funky enough from it to funk out
a whole restaurant, you probably shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: go straight from work to the restaurant
and eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what you do or why you stink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't blame them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some restaurants back in the day,
I noticed before we had legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization and it was a known thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would show up to restaurants with my
scuzzy looking friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know I'm not the cleanest looking
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bathe on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do look like Chewbacca's fucking
baby cousin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got dreadlocks past my ass,
almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a fuzzy beard.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my beard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a goatee.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a mustache.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wore a crooked hat and a t-shirt and
Dickies and skateboard shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I walk into restaurants and back in
the day, and I smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just constantly smell like herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm growing it, smoking it,
whatever, I smell like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would walk into restaurants and they
would kind of roll their eyes and be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: fuck, let's sit these weirdos in a corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that the industry is the way that it
is, they know that kids that look like
[SPEAKER_05]: myself and you and Kev, bro, and whoever
else used to roll with me to places,
[SPEAKER_05]: they treat us like fucking rock stars now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the Grimy Gatsby and I would go to
dinner in Colorado Springs, that waitress
[SPEAKER_05]: would be up our butts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they know it's like, these are weed
industry people and they get paid well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be super fucking nice to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that they get paid well, they get paid
well now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the near future, in the very recent
past, they worked a job where tips or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least service was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we go out to eat now,
we understand that the person serving us
[SPEAKER_01]: our food is making less than minimum wage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if one or two of her tables
stiffs her throughout a shift,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's going to have trouble making ends
meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the service is good,
we always over tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a community, we kind of take care
of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always, when I was doing food
service, I could always tell which one of
[SPEAKER_01]: my tables or which customer has also
worked in the service industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard every one of my food service
friends has said that before.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell who's like, no one in
their family has worked in the service
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in a couple of generations,
but you can tell those fuckers too from a
[SPEAKER_01]: mile away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, I mean, it makes a big difference
if you're a server to know who to treat a
[SPEAKER_01]: little better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it when you take a girl out to
dinner and when the, when the dinner's
[SPEAKER_05]: over, she starts gathering plates and sets
them at the edge of the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, Hey, you're awesome,
but you're not at work right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can chill out on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so rad to see like here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Mike, I don't know how we just
ended up on this fucking route.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a random field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of serious and lots of we're high to
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a couple of notes that I want to
make sure to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some other bullet points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hit, let's hit them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to tease them because we're
going to do these in another podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not even going to hit them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, we won't do this one tonight,
but these are just coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about in the future,
somebody you touched on earlier and I
[SPEAKER_05]: wrote it down, male selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody sent me an email about male
selection and you talked about breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about male selection
in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about the difference
between lab testing and how the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: actually works for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that reminds me that I want to give
another shout out to my friend,
[SPEAKER_05]: Bo, Bo Nellis at the split podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk a lot about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk a lot about cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it from sort of a dude bro sort of
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, we can't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand that that's who I am and
please don't ask me to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're not into the dude bro
culture, dab kid sort of thing that we've
[SPEAKER_05]: got going on here, Bo Nellis has a great
podcast called the split podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she does it from a much more,
I described it kind of like as it's
[SPEAKER_05]: learning cannabis from my kindergarten
teacher, but she's fucking educated and
[SPEAKER_05]: she is learning more and more as she goes
on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: She will talk much more about specific
cannabinoid dosing for specific
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she should call some of her episodes
101 ways to use my cannabis because I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: all about dabbing, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about smoking some flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like some edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bo doesn't waste a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: She uses every bit of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: She can pull out of everything and I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just not my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know someone locally that there was a
first person I ever met that was juicing
[SPEAKER_01]: raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when they defoliate, they take all
that leaf material and juice it as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not crunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they toss the crunchy, but when they
defoliate and it's the grain, they juice
[SPEAKER_01]: all that grain leaf material.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she uses the stuff that she's
vaporized.
[SPEAKER_05]: She makes a tincture with coconut oil out
of that or a topical with coconut oil out
[SPEAKER_05]: of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She makes a cannabis lotion.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has been making cannabis products for
her cats recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so if you guys want a different
perspective on cannabis, if you get tired
[SPEAKER_05]: of hearing our bro culture over here,
which I understand some people aren't into
[SPEAKER_05]: being called dude and bro and they listen
to a podcast all the time, but if you've
[SPEAKER_05]: gotten this far in, you must be into us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want some more, a different
perspective on cannabis from a very
[SPEAKER_05]: well-educated, professional sounding
woman, if you want a woman's perspective
[SPEAKER_05]: on cannabis, I highly recommend listening
to the SPLIF podcast from Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_05]: She does not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you got to do is search for,
I'm going to open up my iPhone right here
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's right here on my podcast
screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is simply, I got to get to the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scrolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is because it's SPLIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SPLIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: S-P-L-I-F-F.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pot, not pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me like a week to find this
podcast just because I was hearing split
[SPEAKER_01]: and pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was the split podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this isn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: SPLIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: S-P-L-I-F-F.
[SPEAKER_05]: The SPLIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: S-P-L-I-F-F podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: P-O-T-C-A-S-T.
[SPEAKER_05]: And her name is Bo, B-O-H Nellis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's a great host.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a cool person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bo, one day, I hope we get to take a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make you take like a half
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make you choke forever because that's how
I do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys, you would appreciate the
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like my show, I feel like you'll
like Bo's show.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has got 63 episodes up right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am 30 something episodes in and they're
getting better and better as they go.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's really good at recommending specific
dosages of cannabinoids and she doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: over-consume cannabis the way that I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's much more on the beginner
consumer side, which I'm not even bashing
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss my lower tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to do some really amazing
things with some low dose cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of the world is on that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Chewbacca's freaking cousin and I like
to over dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to over medicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough of a shout out for Bo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I support that show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to read an article
about particles per million in Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates on one of the next episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think it's something that needs
to be talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got an hour or two to stick around?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we kill our phones to do,
we really try to dedicate an hour or more
[SPEAKER_01]: to you guys when we record this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that involves killing our
phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no idea what time it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 11.20 PM right now and it is six
degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 50 degree or better swing today,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice but windy when I was outside
getting shit done earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a shitty cold a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got crazy windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've like semi flipping windy here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put this podcast back on some rails.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've walked down to a field and sat down
and got rigged.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's let's know.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no PM anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been careful these couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of the fun things about
Colorado is our weather's psychotic and
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to plan your grow for like
fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave to go to this new project I'm
going to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave the house around six 30 in the
morning and I'm wearing seriously pants
[SPEAKER_05]: with shorts underneath a t-shirt,
a hoodie, a jacket, a hat that covers up
[SPEAKER_05]: my ears with my dreads down to keep me
warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take off the jacket, the hoodie,
that hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put on a different hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then for lunch, we go to lunch and it's
nice and warm outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put on shorts and skateboard shoes
and a t-shirt and tie the hair up and put
[SPEAKER_05]: a little small dread hat on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wear that for the second half of the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I leave the facility that I'm working
with, it is a little after six.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I put on again all of the layers
and it's cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's colder then than it was all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we run the full weather gamut here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, daily you get most of the seasons
daily.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the new people that haven't been here
for a solid year are sick right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all walking around with that head
shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the growers that moved here from
far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, even the ones that have been
growing cannabis one way or another for
[SPEAKER_01]: years, are just fight for their first two
years here, trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, every day it starts out at zero
and then it gets to 65 and then it's at
[SPEAKER_01]: zero again.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I not get PM in this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I cure my buds in this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I balance the humidity anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched a guy design like $2 million
worth of floor heating at one point to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to combat some of the weather here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fun watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different people experience it,
especially with, I mean, we've never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: an influx of people like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traffic is getting shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting people asking me like,
how the fuck do people survive this
[SPEAKER_01]: question?
[SPEAKER_05]: When the fuck do they make highway 53
lanes up there?
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike and I are going to turn off some
microphones and take some dabs and not do
[SPEAKER_05]: all of this to you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
episode 171 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys listened for 171 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep saying that I'm going to put out
some old episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint said the same thing today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep saying I'm going to post old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep having more content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel the need to post all of them,
but I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys keep asking for old stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the emails you're sending me,
I am responding to them slowly,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm getting to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't believe how many emails I get
lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's trying to sell me shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just keep getting so many emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just writing a note right now,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking at me like this is part of
the show, but it has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_05]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm getting to all those emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love making listener generated content
that lets me know that I'm getting
[SPEAKER_05]: something out to at least one person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm hitting one person and probably
hitting a lot of people, just one person
[SPEAKER_05]: spoke up from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So send me those emails at
growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike just took nearly two hours out of his
night.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to take a little longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may record another episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you follow him on social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Nemopunk15 on the Twitter and Pueblo
for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cannabis news that we
simply don't have time to work into a
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast or that is only a minute or two
worth of news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that stuff gets, I post a ton
of that stuff to my Facebook page every
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of local cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_01]: National stuff, international stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to talk about it a little
tonight and we just kind of went along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is doing some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be another episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll write that down here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been posting a lot of stuff about
Canada, Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really awesome marijuana
news stories that we haven't gotten onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast yet that are up on my social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap this one up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon is a service that you can go to
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Patreon is a service that allows you
to contribute financially to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: This show will always be free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring you a free podcast because I love
you and I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want cannabis to be legalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what you can do, you can help me pay
for the cost of my website.
[SPEAKER_05]: iRead Genetics Colorado is the website
where this podcast is hosted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It cost me a little over $300 per year to
keep that website alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am paying for that out of my pocket
right now because I love podcasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I've chosen to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would like to help me with that a
little bit, that would be sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to beg you for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon is there for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can contribute as little as $1 or you
can contribute as much as you would like.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sign up for a monthly service to
where you can contribute $1 per month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then every month on the first of the
month, you'll send $1 to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That will help me not have to cover all
the costs of the podcast out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that shows up for the show gets
a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to buy these little microphone
covers, these things here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to replace these quite frequently
because you guys cough into them and they
[SPEAKER_05]: stink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want people having to share that
funky shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made that trip to the store with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really dying for old content,
this is a way to help make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's not up there right now is
because it would double or triple the cost
[SPEAKER_01]: to maintain the web hosting to go all,
what are we, 171?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 171 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: To go 171 deep, that kind of volume and
storage costs a pretty penny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to make that promise yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've still got to get the help to cover
the original.
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody did make the proper Patreon
contribution and they said, post an old
[SPEAKER_05]: episode, asshole, that's the way to get me
to do what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Money fucking talks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Christmas time and money talks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to be that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying $1 goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have a dollar to contribute,
I'm not offended.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want you to listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want you to grow amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this so that when I'm old and too
tired to do this on our own, that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping that enough people know how to do
it well that I can just hit a store and
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it at a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's all I want is that so by
the time I'm too old to fight this fight
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore, that it's taken care of enough
for me to just enjoy the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm asking for is help paying for the
website and buying these little microphone
[SPEAKER_05]: covers and water bottles and yeah,
that's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm bad if you can't folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have got one more super important
thing that I need to include in this
[SPEAKER_05]: episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: This episode comes out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, Ms. JB.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny Beth, I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you have a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope everything goes your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's all we've got for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, you got anything else to wrap it up
with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Merry Christmas, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Merry holiday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever holiday is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what the number is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas is the next big one in my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But happy holidays, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you have a wonderful holiday season
and hopefully we have another podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: before the first of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hear from us again before
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: 18th, 19th.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then that means we got $7.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be I'd completely forgotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my world, it's not Christmas until I
eat a specific type of Christmas cookie
[SPEAKER_01]: that a family member makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like it's just a thing in my
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as I'm concerned, it's like
August.
[SPEAKER_01]: The holidays are far, far away because I
haven't had that cookie yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be joining everybody the day after
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Merry Christmas, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy holiday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Hanukkah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whichever one it is you're celebrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what all of them are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to sound offensive,
but have a great holiday season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat some good food with your friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have some friends and family,
go to my Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll fucking chat down like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have some fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send me pictures of your food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all eat the same shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm vegetarian and I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap this episode up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad they like it when we ramble
because dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody once again for
listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a huge shout out to Miss
Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a cat licking your birthday cake.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody say hooray.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a cat licking your birthday cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't read so he does not know that the
cake is not for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be his birthday too, but the
chance of that is slim.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your birthday today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the table, Mike.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to follow Mike on
Twitter, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is at MemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let him know that you learned about him
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, check out Mike's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of mouthfuls of words.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I put that name up there,
two or three people go like, too many
[SPEAKER_01]: words.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, I needed him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as succinct as I could make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been listening to this show,
succinct isn't really my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I say that this show is the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cannabis news, education,
and conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you're looking for the Nike
Collector podcast, this obviously is the
[SPEAKER_05]: wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to put it right out there,
right at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The intro is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you exactly what you're about to
get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's truth in advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't hear something that sounds
good in that intro, you might want to find
[SPEAKER_01]: another show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking for fun with boats or
fun with maps, this might not be the show
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The look on your face is priceless,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the examples for shows that went
through my head were so family-friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to be family-friendly here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you support Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm trying to do is get people
to follow Mike here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also follow me on Facebook, the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a little flashback.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, how do you get a hold of me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had two options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to give them your address or
your phone number?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like, well, I have 36
different ways you can get a hold of me on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the old school ways don't matter
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now there's no way of ducking anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they can see that you tweeted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't you call me back?
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you tweeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're tweeting, you had time to text.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you up on Snapchat showing that
you're at the mall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you call me back?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be in a meeting, but if you can
tweet from the meeting, you can text me
[SPEAKER_01]: back from the meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a lot of contact information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it shows you, this message was seen
at 2.45.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's 4.45 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why haven't I heard back?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a question, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't duck anybody now.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Social media has got us on lock.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to be accountable.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're on a podcast and if you're on
more than one podcast and you're out there
[SPEAKER_05]: like a lot of people are, you are
accountable for what you say because
[SPEAKER_05]: people will point out that you've made
indiscrepancies.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said this and this, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, God damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't a lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the date wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time it hit me, somebody came up
to me in public and was like, are you
[SPEAKER_01]: white Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned around and was like, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wait, you recognize me
from across the store by my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I need to think before I speak a
little bit, a little bit more sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at one love garden supply one time
talking to burn big shout out to burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a normal shopper in there
and he paused and he looked at me and I
[SPEAKER_05]: go, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he was like, obviously looked at me
and stopped like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was cool about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, you, do you have a podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that's totally me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, I recognized you by your
voice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, whether it's, there are people
listening that recognize us by our
[SPEAKER_05]: marvelous, sexy voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into someone last night,
actually the recognized me from my city
[SPEAKER_01]: council stuff, because that's broadcast on
live TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she goes, I know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, from, and she goes,
you were on TV at my grandpa's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a whole bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This segment of this, the senior citizens
down here in Pueblo, they watch a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: local government, public access,
television, and a lot of them really like
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I go and give city council shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while I was doing it about a
whole bunch of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got this weird geriatric fan
base that loves me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wasn't aware of it until I was
eating lunch one day and I had two senior
[SPEAKER_01]: citizens come up and be like, are you the
guy that goes to city council?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever gotten, are you the guy on
the paper smoking weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you the guy in the news that was
smoking weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only from family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I'm from Southern Colorado,
not quite this Southern, but I have family
[SPEAKER_01]: friends throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of people up in monument,
oddly enough, and they see our city
[SPEAKER_01]: government stuff and they see a lot of our
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would call further up North to
my parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you know what your son's doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's like, he's in his thirties.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck am I going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I would get the phone call from
my folks saying like, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at so and so, yeah, she saw you on the
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that you were doing dabbing?
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mike and I, I happened to be the first
person to buy recreational cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_05]: County of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we legalized the sale of recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photos of the line Jeff got to be first in
are still used all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And national press stories about
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two photos that were taken that
day in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both aerial shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jeff is shopping while that photo was
being taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm first.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm in there buying this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, I mean, this is yours now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I saw it on NBC like a week
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm headed is I was first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've, I've got a picture of myself
actually purchasing cannabis, like the
[SPEAKER_05]: money transaction of handing in money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the owner of the dispensary is a
good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I shook his hand, like, thanks bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that I could be your first
customer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm proud of you for having this fucking
landmark or milestone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shook his hand, told him, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned around to my other friends at
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I said, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grabbed my stuff and I left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I walked outside, I was
interviewed by eight news stations and
[SPEAKER_05]: documentary makers and documentarians,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there were a lot of cameras around me
and I'm really glad that I'm a well-spoken
[SPEAKER_05]: dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that would have been overwhelming
for the fucking most normal people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of that footage, so also that
day there was a newscaster there who I
[SPEAKER_05]: ended up making friends with and she was
like, Hey, we're looking for, they
[SPEAKER_05]: actually asked me if I could smoke there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, can you roll a joint?
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, can you roll a cigarette and
smoke it here with your friends so that we
[SPEAKER_05]: can film that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, actually that's highly
illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't smoke in front of my friend's
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we put a little plan together and I
was like, let's go to my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's all meet at my house at one o'clock
and smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I drove here with Mike joined me
and our friend Wade came and we came here
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of put, we did some prop placing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put some product placement happen and
there were a couple of packs of
[SPEAKER_05]: i-regenetic seeds on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we set up some really nice shots for
them to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't think about the optics of it
necessarily from people who aren't from,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause we were used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were used to dabbing by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were used to the equipment that goes
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parts, the process, the people that
came over to interview us and see this
[SPEAKER_01]: little session, none of them were familiar
with this at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one lady, so there was a cameraman,
there was a news reporter who was from the
[SPEAKER_05]: TV news.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was a newspaper writer and
the newspaper writer hinted, mentioned,
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about cannabis, that she liked
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: She wanted to say, she was saying without
saying, I'd love to smoke that bowl with
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys, but all these assholes right
here would snitch on me is what she was
[SPEAKER_05]: saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did our best to completely hot box,
basically a suburban home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't take much with three grown
men here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 20, 30 minutes they were here
filming and interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We nonstop had a dab rig and a bowl and a
joint going around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in one, in any given moment,
one of us was hitting everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that camera was going to touch
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking a dab, a big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was worried about his, his lens at one
point, he got really, really close to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, bro, that's like a couple
hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't want to get any closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, that shot, that actual shot is
shown on the news so frequently when they
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about marijuana, they show me take a
big dab and blow it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, I feel relieved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure that book is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily they don't use me taking a dab
nearly as frequently as they use you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they still use that footage regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That footage we saw, we agreed that that
footage can be used in anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like either ABC or NBC is what news
organization that was for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's theirs now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's shown all over the nation when
they talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get messages from people all over
like, Hey, I just saw you on my news.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Task Rock actually sent me a gift because
his email was on the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, this guy right here got an
email on the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's hitting the email on the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he sent me a gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was pretty cool.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado affords us a lot of fun little
opportunities like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on the news taking a dab in my
kitchen, my dining room, at this table,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this dab table.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the exact spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting now where I was sitting then.
[SPEAKER_05]: I of course am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have this, I've got the Sheldon Cooper
OCD where this is my seat, but it's where
[SPEAKER_05]: the controls are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be pretty show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go nuts without it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, there's going to be a point to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were 12 minutes in and I haven't even
told you what the topic is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal was very little rambling for this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even done the ad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for supporting the
podcast and listen to our high asses
[SPEAKER_01]: Rambo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love that you love us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who else I love?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep me stocked with dope ass
t-shirts and dope hoodies and dope hat
[SPEAKER_05]: pins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the second person I saw leaving
here now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And another person left here in a red
Handmade Apparel hoodie with a big white
[SPEAKER_05]: logo on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really good on her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at that age where I don't care what
your brand is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your logo isn't hideous and it's a
really good quality item, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like about Handmade is it's
really, really high quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get you the best hoodies they can
start with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a Gildan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's snuggly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super cozy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you put it on, you're like,
oh yeah, it was cozy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so snuggly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a big dude and I feel all cozy in
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the printing quality that these
guys do.
[SPEAKER_05]: My logo of course is red, yellow,
green.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's white in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's black.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's like a skin tone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's whatever color they call
that for my dreadlocks that they use.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are like nine colors in the color of
this design that they made for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every single color pops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all pops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got your back bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike just freaked out cause he turned to
look at the hoodies and I felt the
[SPEAKER_01]: headphone cord snag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I heard the rig move in that mini
heart attack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was watching out for my rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved it for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no, no glass spillage here,
but these hoodies look wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I'm not just trying to sell you
my hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade apparel can make your hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade apparel can make your t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's handmade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me slow down and say this in English
you guys, because I want to get this right
[SPEAKER_05]: for my friends because they do a lot of
good hard work for me and I owe them the
[SPEAKER_05]: proper ad.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends at handmade apparel can make
your t-shirts and your hoodies and your
[SPEAKER_05]: stickers and your hat pins.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can help you with the artwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can get your stuff to you in a timely
manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They support the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're dab kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no reason why you should not
shop with handmade apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you gotta do, all you've got to
fucking English is harder to you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to either take another dab or
something to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you've got to do is go to
handmadeapparel.biz and check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell them that Rasta Jeff from the Girl
From Your Heart podcast sent you and they
[SPEAKER_05]: will hook you up with the best deal
possible to get your products printed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've got a 25 piece minimum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll charge you for 25 pieces plus a
small setup fee because they do have to
[SPEAKER_05]: make screens to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if they're screens anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a printer, but they got to get you
set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really decent job with an
amazing level of quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do a damn good job, way better than
decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've sent me stickers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've sent me shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've sent me, and it's not just my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got shirts that they've printed for
other brands that they didn't know were
[SPEAKER_05]: coming to me that I got from those people
and all their stuff looks quality also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much love, much respect to handmade
apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know that you're listening to the
Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love supporting my friends in the
industry that are doing stuff for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're interested in one of these
hoodies, send me an email to
[SPEAKER_05]: growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are very limited on quantity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got 25 of them printed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a lot of friends that have been
on the show that have already picked them
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike's going to leave here today looking
stylish as fuck in his new Girl From Your
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart podcast hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the Girl From Your Heart podcast
logo above the left breast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says, Grow From Your Heart,
and it's got the little EQ bars in red,
[SPEAKER_05]: yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not have my face.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, on the back, it's got the logo
very large and it's got the original logo
[SPEAKER_05]: with my face and the EQ bars on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Adam Hand that did it
himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Adam Hand adjusted the art because
the art I sent him was a little pixely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was made by somebody else that's not a
super amazing graphic artist, but it was
[SPEAKER_05]: the right idea for what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handmade Apparel took it and polished it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks super dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks super slick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can handle your artwork,
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he thinks very open-mindedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if he describes something to Adam,
he can draw it without ruining your idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can put your idea into motion if you're
not an artist, which is really cool
[SPEAKER_05]: because a lot of artists want to put their
idea into your idea and then put it on
[SPEAKER_05]: paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there goes your idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, much love, mad respect to our
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's tell everybody what this show is
going to be about because I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been going on for a really long time
and we haven't really- That's what life is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be about tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's show, there's some rule changes
that came down the pipe for Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate companies.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found this article on Leafly because it
was the only place I could find it with
[SPEAKER_05]: this article after I did some searching
and it said- These rule changes aren't,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they didn't make the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that there was big
heated debate over where anti-pop people
[SPEAKER_01]: and pro-pop people were fighting and they
were in the courthouse or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't make the press a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Leafly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for the author, Ben Alden,
and this was written on December 12th,
[SPEAKER_05]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this episode is coming out on
December 26th.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everybody had a wonderful winter
holiday, whichever one that it is you
[SPEAKER_05]: celebrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to be inclusive,
exclusive, racist or biased or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever gender you have chosen to
identify as, whatever holiday you are
[SPEAKER_05]: accepting, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy holidays, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: On January 1st, 2017, Colorado will raise
its state regulated limit on the residual
[SPEAKER_05]: levels of volatile solvents allowed in
cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little noticed rule change that
involves dramatically increased levels of
[SPEAKER_05]: allowable solvents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Among the changes, and I'm going to read
off some of the changes they list here,
[SPEAKER_05]: the legal threshold for butane,
the solvent that puts the B and BHO will
[SPEAKER_05]: increase more than six fold from 800 parts
per million to 5,000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I should slow down and kind of
explain what that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: So PPM means parts per million.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that parts per million,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That there are, so if there are a million
parts in there, you are allowed to have
[SPEAKER_05]: 800 parts of butane in there before out of
a million, which isn't a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably wouldn't notice that,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I gave you a million something and told
you, pick me out 800 of them and give them
[SPEAKER_05]: to me, you wouldn't notice you're missing
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're allowed to have 5,000,
which may start making a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may show that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: 5,000 PPMs of residual solvents of butane
feels like a whole lot of butane to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a larger number, but without
significantly more context, it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know for a fact that given the
boiling points, I mean, even like really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really, really high amounts of
butane left in final product, all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: cooks off long before dab to face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes off at the nail if you're getting
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's much of anything left over in
the product, it's gone on the nail long
[SPEAKER_01]: before the dab gets to you with butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it was harmful, they wouldn't be
making these changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we have enough information
yet to know how harmful smoking a
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrate made from butane could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a heavy BHO advocate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably smoke more than 90% of the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the health rules that they haven't
been able to research specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, they have already researched
specifically for similar items.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot about pesticide residual
limits because of the tobacco industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's already something that's mass
produced, that's smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know PPM limits from some other things
for like inhaled medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me keep going to the article because
it mentions stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've pre-read, I did some research.
[SPEAKER_05]: This also, another rule, allowed residuals
for heptanes and other class of solvents
[SPEAKER_05]: will go up by a factor of 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Xylenes, industrial solvents that
technically aren't allowed to be used for
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis extraction at all, will be
permitted at concentrations of up to 2,170
[SPEAKER_05]: particles per million, significantly
higher than the previous limit of one PPM.
[SPEAKER_05]: The state residual limit on benzene,
perhaps the most hazardous chemical of the
[SPEAKER_05]: group, will double from less than one PPM
to less than two PPMs.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little article here that gives
you a graph that is way too small to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, that's a good example of how
statistics can sound scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's going to more than double from
less than one to almost two.
[SPEAKER_05]: But depending on how dangerous those
chemicals are, that can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's something I want to talk about
once we get done through the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes on to say, on the surface,
these are staggering increases in
[SPEAKER_05]: chemicals that at some levels have been
associated with nausea, irregular
[SPEAKER_05]: heartbeat, increased risk of cancer,
and even death.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regulators, testing laboratory operators,
and industry members in other states have
[SPEAKER_05]: expressed surprises at the changes,
which will apply to both adult use and
[SPEAKER_05]: medical markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Van Dyke, chief of the Environmental
Epidemiology, Occupational Health,
[SPEAKER_05]: and Toxicology branch at the Colorado
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_05]: Environment, will recommend the new limit,
acknowledge that, which recommended the
[SPEAKER_05]: new limit, acknowledge that concentrates
capable of clearing the regulatory hurdles
[SPEAKER_05]: could be noticeably different from what's
currently allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumers are going to feel like they may
taste it, he said, of these new allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: butane levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised nobody else has even
actually been interested in this,
[SPEAKER_05]: he told me in an interview just last week.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys making these rules are saying
that we are going to taste and smell
[SPEAKER_05]: butane in our concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know enough about how much butane
that is to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just when you break it down per million,
if that whole gram of hash is one million
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces, the 5,000 that you're talking
about aren't visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not visually identifiable as
separable from the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about an incredibly small
amount here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does surprise me that this didn't make
the press because it does increase
[SPEAKER_01]: residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other way to say that to make
it sound better or worse, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like something that would make
the press, but it was reported almost
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I know about this rule
change is because of the labeling rules
[SPEAKER_01]: that came along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine was negatively affected
by those rules, so I heard about them that
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I heard about an incident.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes on to say, there are a few things
Colorado Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_05]: Environment's Van Dyke wants to make clear
about the new rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This change was not a result of any
industry pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The increase didn't come at the behest.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that word mean, the behest?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what the word means.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never read that word before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they requested it or pushed for
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't know if I said it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it did.
[SPEAKER_05]: The increase did not come at the behest of
lobbyists, he told Leafley.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, in the work groups, if we heard
anything from the industry, I think we
[SPEAKER_05]: heard the other side that these were too
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, which is an uncommon place to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: The justification for the change,
according to Van Dyke, is that the new
[SPEAKER_05]: limits truly follow the best currently
available medical and scientific guidance.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was reevaluated based on trying to
make things health-based, he explained.
[SPEAKER_05]: These numbers come from the International
Harmonized Guidelines for Residual
[SPEAKER_05]: Solvents and Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Van Dyke is referring to a published
scientific article he cited in a July
[SPEAKER_05]: letter to Jim Berak, director of the
Colorado Department of Revenue's
[SPEAKER_05]: Enforcement Division, which is in charge
of enforcing the new standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Van Dyke provided the letter and spoke at
length to Leafley about the coming change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will these numbers stand the test of time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, he said.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're open to new data that comes out,
but our goal is to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_05]: maintain the best we can, the best
evidence-based regulations for health.
[SPEAKER_05]: The agency is trying to do precisely what
has been asked, Van Dyke said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legislation passed this year, then it
lists the House bill 16 dash 1261,
[SPEAKER_05]: put the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment in charge of
[SPEAKER_05]: recommending testing standards based on
medical reports and published scientific
[SPEAKER_05]: literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the Colorado Department of Revenue
set the previous limits in the wake of
[SPEAKER_05]: Amendment 64's passage, it was a fast and
furious process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Van Dyke said, there were times you came
up with numbers because that's what you
[SPEAKER_05]: came up with at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite the eye-popping increases,
he said new limits adhere more strictly to
[SPEAKER_05]: the latest available evidence in
scientific research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That model of we picked a number and we
kind of pulled it out of our ass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we just went with the much more
restrictive sounding rule to start off
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're dialing it back to more in
line with reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to see that in a lot
of different areas of regulation in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're realizing that in a lot of ways,
we way overdid it in some areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't surprise me that this
is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised in the next two
years to see a lot of different testing
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and regulations tweaked up and down
as we learn more and we finally get around
[SPEAKER_01]: to checking the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our driving limit, for example,
the five nanograms, that's just a rule
[SPEAKER_01]: another state had in place and they just
pulled it out of their ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no research at all to tie it with
that, but we made that part of our law
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be allowed near a car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five nanograms was a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to have my primary care physician
run the test on me after not smoking like
[SPEAKER_01]: all night and then going in in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she didn't know which test to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to run three different THC
tests and all of them, whatever the test
[SPEAKER_01]: result came back, I was way above five.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're doing that research now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That research just got funded in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in two years, three years, we'll have
more information to change that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to happen in a
lot of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't surprise me that it's happening
here with PPM limits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the article keeps going and the guy
says, actually, frankly, no, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: say actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually says, frankly, we're not
saying that extracted marijuana products
[SPEAKER_05]: should have 5,000 PPMs of butane in them
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, what we're saying is 5,000 is a
health-based limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he, then it goes on, sorry,
I'm reading way too fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But didn't he just acknowledge the
possibility of literally smelling butane
[SPEAKER_05]: in the BHO approved by the state for
medical patients?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there may be a lot of market
drivers that push those numbers lower,
[SPEAKER_05]: Van Dyke acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_05]: And smell could certainly be one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he repeated, it's not from a health
perspective that those numbers should be
[SPEAKER_05]: lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are residual solvents,
but are residual solvents merely a matter
[SPEAKER_05]: of product taste and quality or is
scientific research still too limited to
[SPEAKER_05]: inspire consumer confidence?
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I'm going to jump in right
now, because even if we're allowed to put
[SPEAKER_05]: 5,000 particles per million to leave that
in there and not purge it out properly,
[SPEAKER_05]: most consumers are educated enough to go,
I don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would go buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got two different products of
Shatter on my table right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was a gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: One will probably remain on this piece of
parchment paper until the end of fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: time, because I do not want to dab it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other, however, was made by an artist
who took their time and their energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you went to the dispensary,
Mike, and this dark stuff that looks like
[SPEAKER_05]: squirrel poop was here available for you
for $25.
[SPEAKER_05]: $25 a gram plus tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a piece of onyx,
but it's half shaped.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty damn dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or this golden, shiny, sparkly stuff here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like pancake syrup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, it does look like thin maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice and it's kind of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The syrup that's spilled on the white
plate is exactly what it looks like on the
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment.
All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one would you grab all day long?
[SPEAKER_05]: All day long with honey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if this was at the store, would you
even buy it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: See?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're an educated consumer like
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even know that a lot of times you
get that dark color just because the
[SPEAKER_01]: material wasn't processed quickly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had time to age a little bit before
it got processed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that that hash, and if you're
listening to my podcast, my friend that
[SPEAKER_05]: makes this hash, you may listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not tell you this when you were here
the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just doing our thing and I didn't
want to mention this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's happening is if you were
using a closed loop system, the material
[SPEAKER_05]: is sitting in the butane far too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking about this was his record
pool, how they got more hash from the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of material than they've ever
pulled before.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because you've pulled out a bunch of
chlorophyll, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the hash has got this dark
greenish color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's a lot of THC here,
but you lowered your THC quantity by
[SPEAKER_05]: pulling more chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_05]: You increased your weight, but you lowered
your potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're doing it in a closed loop
system, be a little quicker about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't leave it soaking in the soak for so
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the hash version of putting a coin in
your grinder.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be time to clean the butane and the
machine also.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're doing this, if this hash was
made open blasted, what you did was you
[SPEAKER_05]: ran too many cans.
[SPEAKER_05]: You needed to stop a can before because
you're pushing it through the tube.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pushing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should run piss clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should look like well hydrated pee.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be clear coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as you see it coming dark,
stop putting Thane through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go as far as to move my can over
the grass or over the cement and just drip
[SPEAKER_05]: it right into there and quit putting it
into my catch jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people do two batch too.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I open blast into an open container,
I do it into a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's got a smaller opening with
less ... I don't do this anymore,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking at me like, don't say that,
but I would do it into a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a particularly bad idea for a
couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it into the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It prevents you from getting contaminants
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do it into a big flat Pyrex dish,
leaves and shit from the trees fall in
[SPEAKER_05]: because you got to do it outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bugs fly into there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A fucking butterfly landed in the mix one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pancake tray or the cookie tray don't
make shrapnel though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to blow anything up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody says that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't open blast people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't make hash anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I feel free talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with butane like that,
there's safety precautions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one way our community keeps
fucking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time some idiot blows up their
apartment or their house trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs in the backyard, just leave it to the
fucking professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember reading in a history class
about bathtub gin and people blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves up trying to make gin in the
bathtub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, how dumb were people back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here I am 35 and my contemporaries
are doing the exact same thing with
[SPEAKER_05]: freaking hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: There weren't professionals six years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then the professionals were us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Big D was a professional back then and he
was doing it with a fucking ... Until
[SPEAKER_05]: three years ago, he was doing it in a tube
in a parking lot, a professional business
[SPEAKER_05]: with a license.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were okay with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you got to have a fucking blast proof
building and all kinds of fire equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: and suits and all training and hazmat
material.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a way different world now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let those professionals do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if we legalize cannabis
everywhere- Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a legalization in the
market because a lot of the places where
[SPEAKER_01]: the frequent BHO home cook blowups are
happening are in legalization states where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's 65, 75 a gram on the shelf for
illegal states where there is no option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in places where there's no legal
access.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have to grow your own and make your
own, you fucking will because people want
[SPEAKER_05]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to do what they have to to
get high, to get medicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not available, they're going to
figure out a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since they just grew some shitty weed
because they can't get the products to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow proper weed, now they got to do
something with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just go get some butane,
run it through some cans and blow up the
[SPEAKER_05]: house and make this look even worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more legal it is, the more likely you
are to screw up the safety precautions you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to take.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's just legal, then you can just go
to the store and get it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, you can go, I can think of
four places I can go right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got all the hash I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never made it- For 20, 25,
35 a gram, a good fire shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to risk blowing your
house up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep reading this article.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we've gotten through the gist
of the article, but I'm going to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: reading it anyway, just because it feels
like there's more.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says a knowledge problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of eyes widened when I talked to
people who weren't aware of Colorado's new
[SPEAKER_05]: standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some consumers believe that industrial
solvents are inherently hazardous to their
[SPEAKER_05]: health and should be avoided at virtually
any level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many concentrate consumers now opt for
solventless extracts, such as rosin or
[SPEAKER_05]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Others don't worry as much, pointing out
that it says accurately, according to most
[SPEAKER_05]: scientists I talked to, that someone who
smells a whiff of butane from a Bic
[SPEAKER_05]: lighter has already inhaled way more than
they'll get in a day of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great, great comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's sitting there talking about
tasting it in the hash at 5,000 ppm,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm sitting there thinking about
refilling my torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your torch gets full and you get that
little blowback, I guarantee you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at way more than 5,000 ppm of
butane in the air around your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that moment, as it's blasted out
excess, I'm sure it dissipates quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't taste butane then,
and I haven't just forced that through a
[SPEAKER_01]: several hundred degree nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy goes on to say, it's not the
butane, said Nick Mosley, co-owner and
[SPEAKER_05]: chief science officer at Confidence
Analytics, a cannabis testing laboratory
[SPEAKER_05]: in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_05]: The butane is really not a huge health
risk, he said, adding that it takes quite
[SPEAKER_05]: a bit, way more than you'd get from
dabbing or a vape pen to cause serious
[SPEAKER_05]: harm, such as liver damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's a 1981 case study cited by
the US Department of Health and Human
[SPEAKER_05]: Services found that exposure to 10,000
ppms for 10 minutes may lead to
[SPEAKER_05]: drowsiness, but doesn't appear to cause
systemic effects in humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: The average dab consists of about 10
milligrams to 20 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrate, Mosley at Confidence
Analytics said, and in the eyes of
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado regulators, he added,
these class three solvents are not cause
[SPEAKER_05]: for concern at 5,000 ppms when the dose of
the substance is so low.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they go on to say, Mosley did call
the levels of xylenes and benzene in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado concerning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue with xylenes and benzene,
he explained, is that the contaminants are
[SPEAKER_05]: unintentionally there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, those chemicals aren't
part of the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those chemicals are sometimes used to
clean equipment and may inadvertently
[SPEAKER_05]: become part of the final product.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's shit that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also sometimes found in low
quality solvents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so if you don't distill your butane
properly, in other words, there are
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminants in the contaminant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mosley wasn't trying to criticize
Colorado's new limits from a health
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective, though he didn't sound
especially jazzed about the idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: finding those residual levels in a
concentrate either.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just meant that a higher, but soon to
be legal level of residuals could indicate
[SPEAKER_05]: careless extraction methods or low quality
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And see, that's what a lot of people's
concern is going to be that this is going
[SPEAKER_05]: to make extractors lazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't have to take all this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hurry up and get this out of the vac
oven so we can get the next batch in the
[SPEAKER_05]: vac oven because this is going to pass lab
tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be able to go on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The limits were drastically increased,
but they were still drastically increased
[SPEAKER_01]: to a number so small that it's
unnoticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about all the other
testing and stuff that goes into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a conversation we're only able to
have because it's insanely legal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Statewide, we have access to product
unmatched anywhere in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as testing and labeling goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know more about the product we're
consuming than anyone on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going through these rulemaking
hearings is part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the limits for anything else on
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not encouraging extractors to push the
envelope of the upper limits that are
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if these are allowed for any other
product I buy at a store or a pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed
for my hash either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also understand the movement away
from solvent-made hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the people that are looking for
high-grade water extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are on that rosin train.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people love rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are haters of BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big part of the marijuana community came
here fleeing the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for one reason or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of their marijuana industry
moving towards that model in any way is
[SPEAKER_01]: scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving away from natural in any way is
scary to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to be the one to point out that
their flowers in the BHO hash are almost
[SPEAKER_01]: identical in every way except for a little
bit of solvent used in the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that's in that flower is going
to be in that extract, including all the
[SPEAKER_01]: bad shit that's already in your flower
just because it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's good for you or
natural in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a little bit, a lot of people were
under the impression that the clear and
[SPEAKER_05]: distillate was removing solvents,
but we have recently discovered that that
[SPEAKER_05]: is not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to use a separate filter to get
out pesticides and solvents from the
[SPEAKER_05]: clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting rid of the solvents because
we're heating it high enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the pesticides that we're not getting
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that wrong probably because I took
too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of rumors about the clear
and 99% of them were just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do love some well-made distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some amazing distillate,
but I don't at all understand the hype for
[SPEAKER_01]: the clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people that are obsessed with the
clear that rant and rave about it because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hype and not because of its actual
properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would prefer my distillate to come
without turps and let me put my own turps
[SPEAKER_05]: in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way I would prefer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see one of the things I really like in
my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I'm such a live resin fanatic
is that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just scoop and glob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiddy glob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to let you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking the distillate, dunking it,
that's fun for me, but I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: build it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I love about cannabis is
the huge flavor profile variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more fun to me to taste what that
flower was supposed to taste like than
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the soda factory and having them
do like 25 different syrups.
[SPEAKER_05]: To create that soda flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like when you can take some
distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they kind of overdo it when
they go mixing the turps in on their own
[SPEAKER_05]: when they sell me the distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's overdone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every distillate I've had that has
terpenes reintroduced has way overdone it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather just be able to do it myself
and then I can buy a bottle of distillate
[SPEAKER_05]: and three or four vials of turps and mix
and match and make it the way I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when I run out of that distillate,
I just put the turps right on my shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been getting little tiny pipettes and
just dipping it right onto the shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe that the terpenoids
contribute heavily to my high because I
[SPEAKER_05]: can dab the same shatter and put different
turps on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tease the future show about lab
testing and how it's changed some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely helped us lose focus on
the variety of compounds in the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: influence the high, the experience,
the medical effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for that show for these
reasons exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different parts of the
cannabis plant that influence its effect
[SPEAKER_01]: on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpenes are a huge portion of the medical
effect and the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel it with that 100% distillate
when you go from a Ghost Train Haze Turps
[SPEAKER_01]: to an OG Kush Turps that you're dunking it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel the high difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the exact same THC, the exact same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you add in the other stuff that
doesn't affect the high, it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-psychoactive stuff that doesn't scare
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Final Fantasy 7 joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It completely changes the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away the first time I
experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the other pieces for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about that entourage slash
synergistic effect, however you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the term entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so descriptive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true because like you said,
when I smoke these Ghost Train Haze Turps
[SPEAKER_05]: right here, this is like, it's a bottle
rocket on your dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take your dab and you're like,
oh, I'm high for my dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a second later, you're like,
I keep getting higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, is this ever going to
fucking stop?
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you put the same dab and take some
of that OG Kush like you were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about, you go, oh, I'm going to get low
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you start like, you want to drool on
yourself for a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you take the, I think it's called
Paradigium, you take that one,
[SPEAKER_05]: I get hyper from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, whoa, with all that,
I want to go run around now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they all have, there's something in
those turpinoids that's doing something
[SPEAKER_05]: completely different to your body and to
your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just releases different chemicals,
triggers different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, lab testing has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we look for is consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's drastically changing the
consumption experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope that allowing more PPMs in
our concentrates does not encourage hash
[SPEAKER_05]: makers to lazy up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting really good at concentrate
making.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that people just keep getting
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the people that are
encouraging and learning and making better
[SPEAKER_05]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody was really excited
about this as far as, yay, now we can
[SPEAKER_01]: shave 45 seconds off our back oven cook.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I first heard about this
happening, I was like, oh, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_05]: is happening?
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that I've read the article,
I think I understand a little more and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: not as nervous or paranoid about the
increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's ever a BHO where I can taste
butane in it, you can guarantee that that
[SPEAKER_05]: hash is going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little worried when it was only
Leafly was kind of reporting this and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was happy to see the level of reporting
they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they're not a hardcore news
org, you see that wander a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy, I'm guessing he just said it is
something dumb during the interview and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been interviewed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes stupid shit slips out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say plenty of shit on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good reporter, I'll skip over the brain
fart that you uttered on the record and
[SPEAKER_01]: stick to the on topic point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this reporter got hung up on the,
we might be talking about levels that
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers could smell or taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he goes on to say how these
levels are perfectly allowed in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can allow 5,000 PPM of butane in a
buterol inhaler, have a buterol inhaler
[SPEAKER_01]: people with that level of people,
have they reported the taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that would be part of the study that
he's citing for the increase and it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because he mentioned that to a
reporter who's not obsessed with keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: the story clean and factual and got hung
up on something dumb, the guy said at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, and now half of people that
read that story are like, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not buying hashed Colorado anymore,
taste of butane.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, you will know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are going to be lab tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I see your container?
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got there the Panama, East coast
Panama.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the lab testing real well on
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some, this is from Turpex and it
is East coast Panama chunk wax.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's labeled a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next numbers listed on here are the
MIP, which is the marijuana infused
[SPEAKER_05]: product license.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the license number of who made
the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the OPC number, which is the
optional premises cultivation center.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's got their ID number.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where it was grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's got a batch number so that we
know which batch of plants went into this
[SPEAKER_05]: mix by researching the batch number.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can tell you what plant tags were in
here, which is each individual plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if they did it properly- And that's
how they track, like those are the numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: they use to do recall track in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can tell you if that plant has been
applied a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can tell you everything that plant has
been sprayed with, fed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can tell you the date it was cut as a
clone, the day it was moved into flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can tell you everything about mostly
everything that about that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it were properly documented by the
grower and the metric supervisor at that
[SPEAKER_05]: facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times she tries to pass through
testing results or what's going to reveal
[SPEAKER_05]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking at this container and it's
got test results on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows me how much CBGA, CBG,
CBDA, CBD, THC, ATHC, and total
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids are on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I assume that in the very near future,
they're going to include these particles
[SPEAKER_05]: per million testing on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those part of these rule changes were
labeling changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That product- Is this an old?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an old product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the hash I've got is a couple of
months old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of hold the hash for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love stockpiling so that I can hit,
every time I go to dab, I've got 35
[SPEAKER_01]: different flavors to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes some planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every now and then I realized that
I've had a hash container for a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 months, and then I make a point to
smoke it all real quick so that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: convert any further.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need some help, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old high THC stuff that's had some aging
to it is really good on inflammation and
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It converts into some other fun stuff
that's really good on inflammation and
pain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It decarboxylates a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It loses a decarboxyl group.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a reason to stash and a reason not to
worry if it gets a little old,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, I'm a hoarder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this labeling isn't up to par and it's
still better than 99% of the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana products you're going to find
sold in the US.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with this other hash container
I've bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worn this label down a little bit,
but a totally different container,
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different shape, totally different
company, exact same information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one, if you look closely,
you can see that the butane PPMs are
[SPEAKER_01]: listed on this label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you read it still?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can read that it used to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, I believe it's triple
zeros for both of the butane and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that next butane was.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pentane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see propane, there was actually 2.75
left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much at all, but it's for some live
resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's to be a little bit expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a little bit of
residual solvent left in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a lot of moisture going on,
so it'll hold onto some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a- Looks like sugary
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plato sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you ever did the thing
with water and cornstarch, but if you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: scratched your fingernail and scratched
some of that out of there, it's about that
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would totally dab that stuff by the
looks of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to shout them out
because we've done a lot of shout outs on
[SPEAKER_01]: this show, but they make some awesome live
resin and I drive really far to get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, sometimes in Colorado, people are
like, but there are stores everywhere,
Nick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I drive up to Denver to this one
place- I drive from West Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: not Pueblo West, but the west side of
Pueblo to the very far north end of
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 126 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drive past at least 300 marijuana stores
to go to the one with the product I like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I do and have done and will do the
same thing in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two or three dispensaries in
Denver that I like to really shop at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you come to Colorado to buy some
concentrates and you get these high
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers, you're going to notice if
something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let the PPM numbers freak you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're buying shatter and it
shatters, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: residual butane.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably doing all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's on the shelf and they've got it,
it's a store.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably doing okay because they'll
get concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit won't sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll go on sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll get rid of it the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll never buy it again.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: The employees are customers as well most
of the time.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a consumer that does doesn't
really know a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing you want to look out for is
if you go to a shop and they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just for example, this is 50,
this is 55, this is 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we have these for 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be wary of the 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason that there's that big,
big discount for that one particular
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be about to pass out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a friend of mine had to throw out a
whole bunch of product at his store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because labeling labels expired and you
can't just slap on a new label.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that date's getting close,
you'll watch it go from full price to half
[SPEAKER_01]: price to exactly what the shop paid for it
to half of what the shop paid for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: please God, let me get any of my money
back on it before the first or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes as a consumer that can be
real helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that just means that that's
the crap that they got tricked into
[SPEAKER_01]: buying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just doing a gnarly dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole room just fogged up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got half a dab off your dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I want to mention is something
I've experienced in Colorado and I'm going
[SPEAKER_05]: to quit talking funny here in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm going to sneeze and cough,
but something that happens, an extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: company, and we're just going to say that
Mike and I have an extraction company.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jeff and Mike's extraction company,
we make extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our specialty.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do is we go to dispensaries that
have a grow involved in their business
[SPEAKER_05]: plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a dispensary with a grow that
grows product and that product goes to the
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we offer to do as an extraction
company is we will take either your buds
[SPEAKER_05]: or your trim, whatever material you want
to give us, and we would gladly turn it
[SPEAKER_05]: into product for you for a price.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is usually, I don't know how much
insider info I should give, but there's
[SPEAKER_05]: usually a deal worked out to where there's
an industry range.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run it, we run it as a company and we
split it with you 50-50.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we get half of the product that's
done, we package it and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we deliver your portion back to the
store and you put it on the shelf for
[SPEAKER_05]: sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the other way to do it is we run it
and we sell it back to your dispensary at
[SPEAKER_05]: a price.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those prices vary widely depending on the
company and the deals that you work out
[SPEAKER_05]: and how much product you're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of the product, the final
product consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: The popularity of the companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're one of the top-known grows and
one of the top-known extract companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll run the shit for damn near free
for each other so that they can both,
[SPEAKER_05]: say, ran by these companies and they both
make a ton of fucking money off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll usually see a pretty tight range in
hash pricing at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like a $10 or $15 window.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheapest one in that window is usually
a company you've never heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean anything other than
they're new.
[SPEAKER_05]: A good example of them, of that company,
of that range is a company called Extracts
[SPEAKER_05]: Inc.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not known, but I think lately
they have been kicking out some
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculously good concentrates at a very
low price.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their packaging is plain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have any advertising,
but the shit is good once you crack that
[SPEAKER_05]: package open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a half dozen new extract
companies that I've never heard of before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first product I see from them is
Stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that they were doing hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make some of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I saw it, it was actually
granny that had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She opened it up and I was like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company down here that used to
come into the shop I was working at all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time that's brand new and just getting
on their feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: From them lately, it's nice to see this
much quality coming on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I was headed with all of this is if
you buy an extract from an extract
[SPEAKER_05]: company, say you get something,
what do we name our company?
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave us a name, but Mike and Jeff's
Extracts Company, whatever the fuck I call
[SPEAKER_05]: this earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are running material grown by other
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to throw them right under the
fucking bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we buy some material from Maggie's Farm
and run it, it's going to come out brown
[SPEAKER_05]: and janky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always does.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen several extract companies run
Maggie's Farm stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something about their grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they trim with the trim machine,
which will fuck up your extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're using old material,
which will fuck up your extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their stuff never comes out good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you run stuff from Kind Love- There's a
million different things that going into a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow that'll fuck up the extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you run material from Kind Love,
it always comes back fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: A good portion of the hash work is on up
to the company that's running your
[SPEAKER_05]: extract, but a large portion of it is up
to whoever grew that material,
[SPEAKER_05]: how long the material set around,
how it was stored, how it was trimmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy some extracts from a hash
company, if you buy some Mike and Jeff
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts and it's shitty one time and
amazing one time, you got to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_05]: to go look at this little OPC and MIP tag
on here and see what the OPC number is
[SPEAKER_05]: because that will tell you who grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies wildly batch to batch with some
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other companies that are a little more
established, I see less variety in what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're putting on shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while, like a year and a half ago,
you would see A plus, F plus in the same
[SPEAKER_05]: ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the products will be really,
really good for a little while and then
[SPEAKER_05]: one guy will quit and everything just
falls apart until he re-figured out with
[SPEAKER_01]: the new- And the other side of that coin
is if you go to a shop and you see a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain you like and you take a look at the
hash and it's a quality that looks good to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and you take it home and you hit it
and you love it and you want more,
[SPEAKER_01]: go back and get more right away because
just the nature of the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: extract companies buy what's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no guarantee that that strain is
going to be made available to that extract
[SPEAKER_01]: company again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does, then it'll be that
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same artist or team of people will be
doing the extraction in the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times that'll be a blend of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The extractors will take a minimum of
usually a thousand grams to run.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want less than a thousand
grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what fits in their column.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had a thousand grams of something,
it would be buds and it wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of fucking shake to run.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't even happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they're putting, what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got East Coast, pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a real strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you got some Billy Dream and some
Golden Go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it all the time when it sounds
like two names swished together on the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost always what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been going for an hour, but you just
put me on something that I want to bitch
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it when extract companies do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It bothers me.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a medical product, we don't need
extract companies creating fucking names
[SPEAKER_05]: out of their hash blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the same issue with growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stabilize it, then rename it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a renaming thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that I find important.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are strains that are well known.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain people rely on certain strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grateful dog works well for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a blue headband and I have no
fucking clue what that blue is from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably blueberry or blue dream,
but you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much prefer if the whole blend was
labeled out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish that extract company would have put
blue dream and blue or headband so that we
[SPEAKER_05]: know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that works wonderfully for you,
we can go find more blueberry or blue
[SPEAKER_05]: dream and more headband for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also creating confusion because
what if somebody does have blue headband?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real flower and a real cross that a
breeder actually took their time to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that kills for the consumer is
people are creatures of habit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to go to the store and they want
their fucking six pack of Corona.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the same thing when they go to
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to walk in and get their three
favorite things just like they do at every
[SPEAKER_01]: other store in their world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, when you walk into a
marijuana store, I understand that you
[SPEAKER_01]: really loved that blue dream you bought
last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really good cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was real popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out of that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where it falls in the range of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's stuff that's similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck picking a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come back tomorrow and ask for
more blue dream and we ain't going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it then either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, there will be more.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's stuff like hash, the store has
almost no ability to call the extract
[SPEAKER_01]: company and be like, we need more sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some sour diesel available
that they're about to run for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might not be any offered to that
extract company for years unless they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the stuff they're processing or
unless the shop is selling the material to
[SPEAKER_01]: the extract company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to guarantee that material
is going to be there when it's time to
[SPEAKER_01]: re-up a shipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're forced to go find new stuff that
you like, which is good and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it because I like a big variety
with my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get why it pisses so many people off.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some people that are very,
in my opinion, it's too specific about
[SPEAKER_05]: their THC and cannabis needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they're a little spoiled and
they should just smoke some dope and
[SPEAKER_05]: relax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are like, I cannot smoke stuff
with the word Kush or this in it or I
[SPEAKER_05]: cannot smoke heavy sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the evolutionary process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brains are designed to remember stuff
that we didn't like or that we perceived
[SPEAKER_01]: as hurtful.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's stuff like foods and
intoxicants, we hold onto those memories
[SPEAKER_01]: for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got that one alcoholic
beverage that they got a hold of when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were 13, 14, 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drank it like it was water and then threw
up for a day and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they can't even see sour apple pucker
or banana red mad dog or whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without getting a little nauseous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You took that to a personal place,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's actually, I doubt that person
where those two references are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things would ever listen to the show,
but on the off chance, they do that laugh
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard when they hear that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's Miller Lite.
[SPEAKER_01]: MGD's- Shouldn't be drinking that piss
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was what was there when we were that
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and a friend drank way too much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the infamous puke fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hungover for five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I see the label, I throw up in
my mouth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have to go buy it for somebody
in my life a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was always a fun trip back from the
store because I'm trying not to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in the passenger seat because it's
making me nauseous.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I felt about rum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rum was not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody smokes way too much Kush one
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how much they consumed, how they
consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have anything to do with the
strain or that it was an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, every time they go to a dispensary,
they make a big deal about how it can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush to their budtender, or it can't say
Durban in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I smoked too much Durban the first
time I came to Colorado and I was alone in
[SPEAKER_01]: my hotel room and I ate that whole brownie
and then I smoked that Durban poison and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, it was- I found myself
naked in the hallway asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't have nothing to do with what strain
you picked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But explaining that is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they get there and the one
thing they found that they really like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're out of and they have to start the
process all over again, it can be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: headachy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish more people expected it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to regulate it a little bit
better so that we've got the products that
[SPEAKER_01]: people want, but it's hard because you've
got a- I have to remind myself how lucky
[SPEAKER_05]: we are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good shit sells out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a first world problem in the extreme.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so spoiled here with our marijuana
markets and the vast assortment of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that's available in that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, prices are coming down,
quality's going up, selection's going up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good for- We've got weed
suppositories now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take your weed in every way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some weed pain cream on today before
I left the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave both knees a coat before I started
getting ready to come over for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got suppositories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got lossages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a hundred different kinds of
hash now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you went to a dispensary a year and a
half ago, O-Pen was the only vape pen on
[SPEAKER_01]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are hundreds of vape pen
companies with hundreds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities, hundreds of different strain
options.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that things are strained specific
now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_05]: The strain specific edibles, strain
specific vape pens, that shit is so great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of just indica, sativa,
or hybrid, you can get actual specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We move closer to the micro brew model
every day with the quality and the
[SPEAKER_01]: selection of products that we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I look at- I mean, just next door to
us, most of the states that surround
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado are still under full prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where my friends scored a handful of good
herb or good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they know about it is that
their friends scored it and it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of the information that
they will ever have on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't miss those days when you go to get
some weed and they had some weed and you
[SPEAKER_05]: got whatever was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the things I like most
about working the retail counter is
[SPEAKER_01]: watching people's faces light up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just learning about Santa as a
small kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a choose?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to rip me off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to watch the numbers on the scale
from my side and your side.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much fun watching people's faces
light up when they see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities really are for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I read stuff like how it
is on the East coast right now in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: places and I just cringe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to educate everybody so that
we can legalize places everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legalize cannabis, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we've been going for an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to start wrapping up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been going for an hour and five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any better way to wrap the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than asking for people to follow
Mike on Twitter, follow me on Twitter at
[SPEAKER_05]: GFYH Podcast.

[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one asking you for money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't be mad that you don't have any
extra money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I appreciate the people that can't
contribute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, I feel like I've been going on
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, I owe you a huge thank you for
coming and doing two podcasts with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crushed it tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did a good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you did a great job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I let you talk for a whole bunch because
you had a lot of shit on your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a really fun couple of weeks in
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been a lot of scary news
announcements, but there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: good ones too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot wait to see what the future
brings.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017 is going to be interesting as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all in good ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just made 37 facial expressions trying
to think about these.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many different possibilities
for next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like on total recall the dude's
mask broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that got less likely is the
aliens making contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guaranteed if they're watching us from
above, they're continuing their policy of
[SPEAKER_01]: wait and see for the next four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, pretty much every fucking
other possibility from peace on earth to
[SPEAKER_01]: nuclear war got like 5% more likely this
year to last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an interesting year for
damn sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely going to be an interesting
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That dude's got the combination to the
button.
[SPEAKER_01]: The least confusing thing so far about
Trump being elected is Trump getting
[SPEAKER_01]: elected, which is confusing in its own
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the decisions he's made since
election night have been more confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: than America choosing to elect him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, if you're not following Trump's
Twitter feed, just give that shit a
[SPEAKER_05]: follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife finally broke down and created a
Twitter feed to follow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to follow Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to follow Trump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're pooping or whatever you're
doing, just go give it a good follow and
[SPEAKER_05]: just like his tweets because it's
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel the need to like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be following them.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you should do though is go to Twitter
and follow the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should definitely follow us on Twitter
before you follow Trump.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find me on there also.

want to reach out on social media,

the emails that people send me.

them coming because I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to get through all of them
before the end of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I get to your problem in your
garden before your garden is harvested.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email is the best way to ask good
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a grow question or a policy
question or a good question for Jeff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd like an answer on the show,
email is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've repeatedly seen him contact and then
drag the appropriate person to respond or
[SPEAKER_01]: the person that was requested respond back
on the show to get your question answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other podcaster is going to recruit
people from Denver?

organic questions.
