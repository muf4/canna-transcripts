[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 112 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now you guys are listening to a song
called The Doggy Dug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off the album, The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this podcast is brought to you by
our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass, glass made in America by
American.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm shopping for a new rig,
I like to know that what I'm paying for is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give me a nice fat dab,
and I can always rely on Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't trust your dab to a rig
made in China by a Chinese child without
[SPEAKER_00]: proper eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or adequate pay, probably barefoot,
working all day with no wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys buy Hitman Glass, made in America
by folks who dab as hard as you and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass is not only a glass company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Duggy is a huge part of the
cannabis and hash movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support Hitman Glass,
and be sure to check out the Chalice
[SPEAKER_00]: Festival in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to HitmanGlass.com, and also search for
Hitman Glass Duggy on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry guys, I'm coughing through the intro
because I'm already sitting here hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: my Hitman E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first Hitman rig, and I've been
impressed since my first rip out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: bad dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at Illusions Glass
Gallery about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been my go-to rig all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting right here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I've got the, let's see,
it's got the white Hitman logo on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the black flame logo up the stem
piece where the nail goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a big fat base on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the E-Series perk, so the perk
has the letter E in it four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a Hitman highly educated
dualityne nail on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my go-to rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably my favorite rig in the
whole collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the new rig arrives, we will talk
about that one when it gets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, make sure you support Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a new rig,
go to HitmanGlass.com and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that Rasta Jeff from the
Girl From Your Heart podcast sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystic Roots, that was good timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am recording on Christmas Eve.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this comes out, Christmas will
have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys all had a wonderful
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got the gifts you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you gave a bunch of wonderful
gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got to see people smile at the
gifts that you gave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also the last episode for the year
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I come back, it will be the year
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put together a checklist of
things that you guys should be doing like
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly, daily, weekly, monthly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put together a checklist of things
that you guys should be handling in your
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get that out to you at the
beginning of the year so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're already on top of your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure also there's some shit that
you were missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we need a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make myself a bunch of ridiculous little
notes, try to remind myself of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try to make a list for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm Rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn on this music a little
bit and we will get into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dun, dun, dun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't feeling the Christmas vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally got all my Christmas
shopping done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm feeling the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sitting here taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the show prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys would prefer grow lessons,
but it's been a busy couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw this news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a little bit of
news on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I am going to talk about how I
got into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with a few friends that
have known me for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, dude, how did you even
get into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, that's a podcast
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just say it into a microphone
and then you guys can listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about that in a couple of
minutes before I get to the news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to talking about how I got
into the industry, I want to give a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend asked me about foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually applying silver thiosulfate
to his plants so that he can reverse his
[SPEAKER_00]: females into males and make feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me one question about foliar
spray that I thought I should help you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys out with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were spraying your plants,
whether it be foliar spray, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, whether it be silver
thiosulfate to try to make male plants out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, however you were spraying them,
I highly suggest that you either spray
[SPEAKER_00]: right when the lights go off or that you
turn the lights off while you spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons for this,
but my main reason for this is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to spray your plants when
you've got big, heavy, high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge lights right above them,
because you're going to spray little
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles all over your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put this layer of bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically a bunch of bubbles all
over your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a nice, fine mist when you
spray, so you're going to have bubbles all
[SPEAKER_00]: over your plants, plants are going to be
soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these high intensity discharge lights
are going to shine down onto those
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to work kind of like a
magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when you were a little kid and
you used to roast ants with the magnifying
[SPEAKER_00]: glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, not everybody did that,
but a lot of the boys are nodding their
[SPEAKER_00]: head going, yeah, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to do the same thing to
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are going to act like the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubble is going to act like the
magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your leaf is going to get little white
burn dots on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be really confused as
to what it's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think a bug ate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think you have a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think something's messed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, what happened was you foliar
sprayed and the light made a little bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: on there and it burned the shit out of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend either removing the
plants from the light, turning off the
[SPEAKER_00]: light or waiting until the light clicks
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when that light clicks off,
if you've got a small crop, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get in there and you should be
able to spray that entire crop in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your plants won't even notice that you
kept them up for a couple of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you're not going to get any
burns on your plants from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're not interrupting your
photo period and your plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get all of the light that they should have
gotten throughout the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend spraying right as the
lights go off or if you need to turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights off or if you must just remove the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only going to spray one or two
plants, like my friend Fred is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse a female plant into a male by
spraying it with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just take that plant into
another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost take that plant to another
part of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a home grow, I would go out to the
garage and spray it out there because that
[SPEAKER_00]: way you will not get any of that silver
thiosulfate on the plants that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: remain female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my guidance on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Fred, let that plant that you sprayed
dry before you return it to the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: with the females because you don't want to
spread that liquid dripping silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate onto any of the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's my guidance on foliar
spray or pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly don't do it with the lights on
because you don't want to burn the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now I've got a news article
that I'd like to share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from The Westward and this
article was written by Thomas Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check out westward.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Westward is a Denver newspaper,
like every town has their little local
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Westward is their little local like
alternative magazine newspaper type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out if you're
ever in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever want to know where all the
cool shows are, where the good food is,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever's going on, that's the article or
the magazine to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, The Westward article goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going on in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not notice as you drive through
the town, which took a big hit during the
[SPEAKER_00]: steel recession of the 80s and has slowly
been coming back, but your nostrils should
[SPEAKER_00]: get a clue once you reach the outskirts
where the aroma of cannabis hits you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this isn't an unusual odor in
Colorado these days, the pot industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: in full bloom in the county surrounding
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could write my high school
guidance counselor a letter about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: says Michael Cadwell, director of sales
for the Los Sueños Cannabis Farm as he
[SPEAKER_00]: sniffs a bud the size of a football.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way we do it, he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse my coughing, you guys, I was taking
some dabs earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Sueños is a 36-acre farm just outside
the city in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the largest outdoor grows in
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike Denver County, this one does not
require that commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation be confined inside,
and a stroll through the four fields
[SPEAKER_00]: planted with 55 strains shows what a
difference the bright southern Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: sun makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants here grow much taller and heavier,
and they need to be tied to stakes just to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high elevation and increase in
ultraviolet rays tricks the plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: higher resin production, explains Aaron
Hovey, head grower at Los Sueños,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the natural sunlight is virtually
year-round, he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, the area can get cold, so when the
winter frost hits Los Sueños and outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing becomes unfeasible, Hovey and his
team operate in four greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: a more eco-friendly alternative to the
light bulb warehouse setups in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a thousand lights and some
huge warehouse for massive production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not what we're trying to do
down here, Hovey says.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is farming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hovey grew up in North Carolina,
where he started growing marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the objections of his parents and
local law enforcement, he honed his craft
[SPEAKER_00]: there before finding a legal haven in
Pueblo County, where he now nurtures the
[SPEAKER_00]: lives of more than 10,000 marijuana
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no playbook to growing pot like
this, and there are no guarantees with
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the natural elements,
but that's what makes it fun, Hovey says.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be successful at this without
good help.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the hail and mold hits, you need
people who know what they are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hovey is just one of many Coloradans who
moved to Pueblo to work with illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, but locals are getting in on
the action, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 1,300 jobs were created in
Pueblo County in 2014 by the Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry, according to a study by the
Southern Colorado Growers Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: a staffing firm that helps people land
marijuana jobs, opened in Pueblo last
[SPEAKER_00]: February.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, industrial vacancies
decreased by more than 15%, and
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana-related businesses accounted for
36% of new commercial building projects in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo County in 2014, according to the
Pueblo County Regional Building
[SPEAKER_00]: Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are quickly realizing that the cost
of cultivation is a lot less in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and outdoors, says Pueblo
County Commissioner Sal Pace, who is
[SPEAKER_00]: champion of the marijuana industry as a
form of economic growth in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very sizable rural agrarian
portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I've never read that word before,
and I probably should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Coloradans voted to legalize the
growing and selling of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, they also agreed to allow towns
and counties to choose whether or not to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow retail pot businesses within their
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, already the state epicenter of
medical marijuana, quickly became the
[SPEAKER_00]: first retail marijuana capital of the
world, while much of the rest of the state
[SPEAKER_00]: struggled over the decision of whether to
accept pot businesses and, if so,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to regulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pace and his fellow commissioners were
keen on the idea of an agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana economy early on and began
issuing cultivation licenses in 2014 in
[SPEAKER_00]: hopes of spurring local industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are now cultivation licenses for 33
medical operations and 57 recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: operations in Pueblo and Pueblo West
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clarify for people that are not
from Colorado, and there was a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: things in that sentence I want to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there are now cultivation licenses
for 33 medical operations and 57
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational and medical are grown in
completely different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a grow applies to be a legalized grow
with the MED, the Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: Division, they either apply to be a
medical grow or a recreational grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the difference in licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how your plant count adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how your cannabis is handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cannabis is grown in a medical
facility, it can only be sold to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: retail facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cannabis is grown in a recreational
facility, it can only be sold in a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational retail establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they make the indication
there if it's a recreational or a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they talk about Pueblo and Pueblo
West County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are on the border of each other,
and there are a bunch, I think there are
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 or 15 dispensaries in Pueblo West,
which is just a small, short quick drive
[SPEAKER_00]: from the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually worked in Pueblo West,
and I live in the south side of Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it used to take me just 15 or 20
minutes to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like it's a distance and the
city of Pueblo does not allow any cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sales within city limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that is sold is just in
Pueblo County and Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've gotten off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, although the city of Pueblo
allows cultivation, it's been more guarded
[SPEAKER_00]: in its approach to sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational pot shops are still under a
moratorium in the city until a public vote
[SPEAKER_00]: on the matter in November of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So residents need to purchase their pot at
one of the 13 recreational shops in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: County, where retail sales are legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pueblo City Council is starting to
come around on the medical side,
[SPEAKER_00]: however, and the first MMJ dispensary
within Pueblo city limits opened in
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo natives Steven and Monique Duran,
who've been together for 13 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: started looking into medical marijuana
businesses several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started studying medical marijuana
after his shift at the Comanche Power
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant, while Monique became a regulatory
rules whiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, after finding one of the rare
buildings in Pueblo that met all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: city's stringent zoning requirements for
the marijuana operation, which include the
[SPEAKER_00]: location and a small council approved
industrial zone, the Durans poured their
[SPEAKER_00]: savings into a lease for the building,
which is now the 719 MMJ dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a map the city had for us in
order to meet the requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found this place, which met all of
them, Monique says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's us and one employee running
the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a couple, but we want to be the
model for how to properly medicate
[SPEAKER_00]: patients in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be many competitors following
that model, though, since zoning maps,
[SPEAKER_00]: the zoning map is so restrictive that only
a few more medical dispensaries might
[SPEAKER_00]: manage to find a suitable spot within the
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: The couple's inspiration for 719 came from
watching Steven's sister struggle through
[SPEAKER_00]: the difficulties of multiple sclerosis and
seeing how pharmaceutical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: medication affected her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was just a different person on those
meds, says Steven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing what real patients have to fight
through was some strong motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these homegrown owners are happy with
what they've created, just coming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shop and looking around as two kids from
Pueblo who never really had much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's like a dream, Monique says.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a cool story, and we hope to
make it a better one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several years ago, like the article said,
this town was falling apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I used to tell people that I'm from
Pueblo, Colorado, they would laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would not take me seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I'm in Denver or Colorado Springs
and I say that I am from Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people are like, oh, you got a
lot of weed going on down there,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're starting to get a little bit
of respect in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to The Westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for publishing an article about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I need to take a drink,
and then I will be right back to talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about how I got into the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a drink as promised, and as any
good dabber would do, I took a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: fat dabs while I was off the mic,
spared you the coughing into the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was dabbing, I want to share this
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the package?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit of LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's LA Confidential crossed to some OG
Kush, but this is PHO Wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I'm smoking BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the shatter and dabs that you see
available on the market right now are made
[SPEAKER_00]: with butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hash was made with propane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me open up some shatter that was made
with butane so that I can compare them
[SPEAKER_00]: side by side and kind of give you a little
better description of what I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shatter, most of you guys are
familiar with shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is an amber-y colored,
sort of a honey colored slab of shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little thin sheet of real,
if I bend it, it cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it'll just pop off and some of it'll
chip off and go flying away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're watching Jurassic Park,
all those big slabs of like the amber
[SPEAKER_00]: resin that the bugs are kept in,
that the bugs are stuck in, that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter looks like in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that stuff looks like shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compared to the shatter, I'm going to
open up this PHO and take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is propane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, man, it looks like a piece
of soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really lightly colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost resembles, since it's holiday
time, this looks like a small piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: Amanda's peanut butter fudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if somebody cut Amanda's peanut
butter fudge perfectly smooth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would look just like this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed that there was a kind of a
shitty technical difficulty with my
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if part of the show was
subpar quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just noticed that there wasn't
something working properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the failed cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure it's just an XLR cable that
needs to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was talking about this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm picking some of it up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much easier to handle and deal
with and work with than shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is real sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stick to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you break it, it'll break off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your fingers heat it up, it gets kind
of goopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding onto this PHO and I am able to
break off little dabs for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to break off big ass dabs for
myself and little dabs for my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a few dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I can really say,
this stuff is flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really sweet, really dank
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even properly describe the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a cushy flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The essence of cannabis is really in the
PHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was skeptical at first, but a friend of
mine that works at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: she convinced me that I wanted to try some
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grabbed myself a gram and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give a shout out to the company
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually do this because I am
affiliated with another facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am going to give a huge shout out to
the Kraft Concentrates for their LA Cush
[SPEAKER_00]: PHO Wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is tasty and I do approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to my friend Jessica
for convincing me to pick up a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Jess?
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody buy some, take dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said I was going to come back and
choke into the microphone a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I said I was going to come back
and talk a little bit about how I got
[SPEAKER_00]: myself into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grabbing, I wrote a couple of little
notes here, nothing major.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a couple of little bullet
points while I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to say that I was in the
cannabis industry illegally before the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry ever existed,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much of this I should
talk about or admit, but we're beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The statute of limitations is probably
gone if I admit to any criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, when I moved here from California,
I was going to high school here and our
[SPEAKER_00]: little crew was on a camping trip and
somebody pulled out a pipe and we started
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, nice, some weed,
because I hadn't seen weed since I'd left
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, all right,
all my friends smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we're going to have to find
somewhere to buy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of our crew really had a weed guy
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that a couple of the guys at
school were hustling weed, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really, there was some racial tensions
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my school back in that time,
the Mexican guys hung out with the Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: guys and the white guys hung out with the
white guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't fight or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of what those groups did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no reason for us to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were over here listening to Green Day
and Nirvana and Phish and they were over
[SPEAKER_00]: there listening to, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to Cypress Hill is one of the things I
remember they listened to a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I was brave enough to hit up
one of the Mexican guys that I knew sold
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, think you'd sell me some
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was kind of leery about it at
first, but he's like, yep, you have to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time we were just high school
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an ounce was a little bit of a stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought an ounce and I started hustling a
little bit of that herb to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those guys were heavily connected
and they were like, you're moving ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start moving pounds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started throwing me pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pounds for dirty, dirty cheap around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this town I had the cheapest hookup on
pounds around here for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until one day I was selling a pound on the
east side of town and a couple of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: with face tattoos and assault rifles
walked up to my car and they did not take
[SPEAKER_00]: my shit from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so amazed, but they told me that I
was not allowed to be selling my product
[SPEAKER_00]: on that side of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I was able to sell my product on the
north and south ends of town, but don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck with the east and west side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they see me again, they're going to
take all my shit from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sent me home nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of just became the street dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hustled the brick weed, the Mexican
brick weed from a couple of friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: were just flooding it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since none of the other white guys in
my neighborhood wanted to talk to these
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican guys, I was just getting pounds
from the Mexican guys and just selling it
[SPEAKER_00]: to all my gringo friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was working out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I made my break
into the weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I learned how to hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is a fictional tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were involved in any sort of law
enforcement, I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing a book and that is all going
to be in the fictional book I'm writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how's that feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking and hustling and doing my
thing several years go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy that lived in the same
apartment building as me when I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that guy was growing weed in his
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would listen to his conversations
between my friend Wayne and my uncle Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: and this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would talk about how to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like somewhere between seven and
10 years old when I lived there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I absorbed so much information from
that conversation that I felt like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: destined to grow weed at some point in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we jump way forward into the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even tell you exactly which
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine was growing some weed in
Colorado and he needed a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went and helped him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't let me do a whole bunch,
but he let me, he exposed me to some
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I learned how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved to Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just for unrelated reasons,
for musical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chased a band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chased the dream of being in a band and
went and played in Lawrence, Kansas for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years, traveled around the
Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, a friend of mine there had a
place where we would play music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day I was playing the drums and I
looked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I looked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're playing the drums,
your eyes just wander.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes just go places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get bored of staring at the guitar
player's back all day because the guitar
[SPEAKER_00]: player's asses are all to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked up and I see this light coming
from the attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh shit, that's a high
intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got an HPS light up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing some fucking weed up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like the crawl space in the
garage, a little storage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I waited for everybody to leave except
for the dude that owns the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, hey bro, I'm not to be an
asshole, but I got hit in the face with
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow light a couple of times up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you got up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of looked at me like,
huh, we'd smoked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drank together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes, what do you know about a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm, I'm okay in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been like in charge of a grow,
but I've been a helper plenty of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, then come up here,
help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need help doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be out of town for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take over?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes out of town and he ended up
getting in trouble and he was gone for
[SPEAKER_00]: several days, way more days than expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of took care of that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: A harvest time came and I was there
through the whole harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped the dude pull down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped him trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got paid pretty decently for helping him
trim some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was in Kansas, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got paid a little extra because we
were really running a risk being in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws, it was still completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were growing in basically a jam
space where we had a band practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were begging for attention every day
with plants just right above my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could reach up and touch the ceiling
where these plants were sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, which would be the floor on the
opposite side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to finish that crop with my buddy
in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually brought some of that that we
grew what I got paid with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought that back to Colorado and shared
that with a lot of my friends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friends are like, dude,
you guys kind of killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were kind of impressed with my
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to move back to Colorado for some
family reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents were passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to spend the kind of final days
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of my good excuses to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence, Kansas was fucking me up,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a drug addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to get away from there and change
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I have not drank since
Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming it on Kansas, but once I
left there, I was able to get away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I'm way more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I moved back to Colorado and I get
a medical marijuana card because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of weed on the streets anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed that I can find isn't up to
the expectations that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as available as I would like
it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a medical marijuana card and I
told myself that when I got this medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card, I would quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that there's as much cannabis
available as I want, why do I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: drink, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to a couple of dispensaries and
some of them were okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was when it was the wild,
wild west, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to a couple of dispensaries and I
don't really see anything that impresses
[SPEAKER_00]: me, but I made friends all over the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day somebody told me,
hey, there's a new dispensary in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of a private deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told me that you had to call this
number first, and then they would tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had to knock on the door at
the back of this building and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: let you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get my card ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my ID and I called the number and
the guy's like, sure, I'll be home in
[SPEAKER_00]: about a half hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just come knock on my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knock on his door and he lets me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an old health food store
downtown and it was a three story
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to walk up the back stairs to
the third story and knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this dude had an apartment up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would ask for your ID and your
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he would have you sit on the couch
and then he would light up a joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you smoked about half the
joint, he would bring out a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one of the first ones he showed
me was chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had AK-47 Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I remembered, but I remember the
chocolate chunk got my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he comes and shows me, he shows you
these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he only let me buy a quarter the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He checked my medical marijuana paper too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a copy of my ID and my medical
marijuana card and sold me a quarter and
[SPEAKER_00]: told me that I could come back every day
if I wanted and we'd make friends and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of grabbing herb for other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go get weed for the girl I was
dating at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grab weed from my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a DJ friend of mine who needed
weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was the only one that really knew
about this dispensary in my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go there every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would gather all my friend's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go to this dispensary and ring the
doorbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd call him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd bring the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he let me in and we'd sit on the
couch, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd sell me a couple of quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day I'd go, he'd sell me a
little bit more and a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he'd be like, so what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, this is just for the people
on my block, the people that sit in my
[SPEAKER_00]: basement and smoke weed all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of them smoking all my weed,
I'm grabbing weed for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day I show up and I could tell that
he's overwhelmed with work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just completely slammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk up the stairs and I could see that
he's been carrying shit up the stairs and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all piled up by the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell that he's getting ready
to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you're going to transplant
some plants, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, yeah, you ever done that
before?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh yeah, I've transplanted
a whole bunch of plants in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have at this point, I've been
growing for a little bit and I've helped
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple other gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I got that little lesson
when I was a little kid from my grower
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor in the apartment building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yeah, I can definitely help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, tell you what, come back
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, come back at like 10 in the morning
and we'll do all of this tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the grow and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go back, of course I show up a few
minutes early and he's impressed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke and get good and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he shows me the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a bunch of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a third story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building that they had his apartment was
on the top story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle story was all the big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he shows me the grow and he's like,
we need to pot all of these pots into
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, cool, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me like, I dunno, maybe seven
hours to do all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He watched me do a few and he's like,
shit, this guy knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just went out and did his own
business and left me there to do those
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went up, uh, back up the stairs and got
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey bro, these are all done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will pay you at the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everybody gets paychecks at the end
of the week around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have money then I just come back at
the end of the week and I'll give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: money, or you can have credit at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you shop here anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm good on herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been buying a bunch of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just come back at the end of the week
and get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, so I would show up for the
next few days and I would go to buy my
[SPEAKER_00]: regular quarter or half ounce or whatever
I was getting for the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just bring cash for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he would always have work for me
when I would show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, well, you transplanted
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to cut clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I know how to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go into the little room and we cut
like a hundred clones and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not how many hours you worked and we'll
pay you on Friday or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the week, I work a few hours
and Friday comes along and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many hours do you think you worked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you probably owe me,
you know, a couple hundred bucks or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the numbers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well here, the boss sent
you this and he handed me a nice stack of
[SPEAKER_00]: cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's way too much money,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, well, we want you to come
work for us every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you here from like 10 to five
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll pay you this much every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just show up and do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude was running the dispensary out
of his bedroom and I was running the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: on the second story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would have to go run errands.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would do deliveries also at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of, it might've been illegal
back in the day, but whatever that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going to do deliveries and he'd be
like, Hey bro, people are coming up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you be able to help them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one night I'm helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had medical marijuana patients
that would show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people were really sick and we were
a real dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one night there was an elderly couple
came up and I'll never forget them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lady was actually sick and we sat on
the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was having the conversation,
the guy that was running this dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: showed up and he got to hear me explain
the differences between indicas and
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he let me, he got to hear me kind of
care give for this woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had built a relationship with her over a
few minutes and figured out what's wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, why she's sick, how she likes to
consume cannabis, what she's consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: for, how it makes her feel if indicas or
sativas work better for her, what the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference is between indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 30 minutes talking with this lady
to make sure that I sold her the right
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and to make her feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was her first time buying cannabis from
a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude that actually ran the place
walked in and saw me doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, bro, you were amazing at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no business doing it after seeing
what you just did with that lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, you were kind of now the
budtender guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't the word budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think existed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, you were now the sales guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be dealing with the
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I've got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow weed most of the day and deal
with the customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, I was like,
we've got a dispensary on the third story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why don't we have this down on
the first floor where everybody can access
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said that the city asked them not
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, we've got all of the
proper licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday, when I come in, I'm going to move
this door down to the first floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we went to the second story
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved, we cleaned out an area and went
to the second story so that you could come
[SPEAKER_00]: into the first door on the bottom story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be a little office area and
we'd greet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'd take you up to the second
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second floor and sell you buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just kept getting braver and
ballsier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, we got to move this
down to the first floor where the handicap
[SPEAKER_00]: people can come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medical marijuana dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we moved it to the first floor and the
owner was really excited about what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I love that you got balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I love that you can help the
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I love the way you deal with
things, you know, about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gave me a full time position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually the guy that hired me ended
up moving on to open his own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to open his own dispensary
because he was, he learned how to run it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw everything he needed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a dream of opening his own shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't want to work for my friend,
Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Tom Sexton and Karen Garnett.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who gave me a shot other
than Richard under Richard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard is the one that kind of told them
to hire me, but then they trusted me with
[SPEAKER_00]: their shop and gave me a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day Richard left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole nother story on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know me, you know that story
there and I'm not ever going to tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so Richard left one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom and Karen came over to try to run the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much had the store under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew all of our customers by first
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a young lady by the name of Tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you ever listened to the
show, but I hope you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a beautiful young lady named Tree
who ran the front desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for a short time, there was a
young lady named Chrisann.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear this, Chrisann.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope we get to hang out and
play some music sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved both of those ladies, but they
were kind of my door girl, my door lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: my greeters, my, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A receptionist kind of lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the, the shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: A receptionist kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would check people in when they got
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, Hey, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see your marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put you in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'd send them back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, Jeff, your patient Bill is
heading back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd come back and see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner that originally owned the place
would show up every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of a systems guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make like systems and procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running a dispensary,
you've got to have like procedures in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that shit flows or shit doesn't flow
properly, just like any real business
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would set up procedures and systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing against my friend,
Tom, who owned the place, but he's an old
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern boy from North Carolina and he
doesn't believe in any sort of systems or
[SPEAKER_00]: order or putting things here or doing
things this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just wants to smoke a joint and let
things happen the way they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is beautiful, but it doesn't work
for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day I had to get the balls and I
had to say, Hey, Tom, the best thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: your business right now would be for you
to go on the mountain and grow the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that you grow and bring that weed back to
the dispensary and let me sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the hell out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you really think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I love you, but you don't
know how to run a business, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of a train wreck when it comes
to a retail establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he handed me the keys and he said,
young man, you got yourself a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he left and he let me run that
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I met our friend, white Mike
that comes on the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Mike there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hired Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was the first person I ever hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I ever hired anybody as an
employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hired Mike to work as a backup budtender
at Metamar Ministries Dispensary in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hired a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shop got huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the only shop in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the most popular shop in this part
of Colorado for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hired a couple more employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hired several more employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Jordan and Andrea as backup
budtenders and computer people and
[SPEAKER_00]: managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm kind of getting
sidetracked here talking about Metamar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reminiscing in my own head.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day a city manager and a police
officer came in and handed us a cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: desist letter that said we could no longer
serve cannabis out of that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pretty much, all of the patients
that were in the store, we gave them most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product that was on the shelf
because we were now closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing we could do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I picked a jar of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike picked a jar of chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan picked a jar of what he liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Andrea picked a jar of what he liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took those jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boss was like, go get a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what happens to the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the owner gave us the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave most of the edibles and all that
perishable stuff to all the people that...
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the cop came in, a bunch of people
just left.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people that stuck around,
they got a lot of free products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just gave all that shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Metamar was officially closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the end of that era, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my jumpstart into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink of this
frosty cold Dr. Pepper and I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm drinking Dr. Pepper,
I'm going to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Hunt is trying to quit drinking Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why somebody would want to do
such a thing to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Metamar ends up closing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in this town knew who I was from
Metamar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knew that I was in the weed
game, that I was growing weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had all the weed available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody started calling my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, the store is closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can we get some herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still doing... I had what's called a
caregiver grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time I was working at Metamar,
I was acting as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a personal home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was completely legal and compliant with
the state of Colorado because I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: private registered caregiver for five
other medical marijuana patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, which meant that I was allowed to
grow plants for myself and them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was growing product for myself and my
patients, but a lot of these people were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get it from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a select few that honestly,
I sold the shit out of some weed to those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, but I don't do that anymore so I can
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really ended up doing was I was
caregiving and I was consulting and
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching people how to be a better
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go, if you didn't know how to
grow weed yet, I'd go to your house and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd help you set up your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd figure out how much herb you need to
grow, how much space you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd set you up and then I would either
get a fee upfront or I would get a portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how I stayed afloat
there and kept myself real popular into
[SPEAKER_00]: this cannabis industry around here,
that and caregiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I saw Metamar start,
I'd been breeding seeds and crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a little bit before now,
before this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Metamar went down, I realized
that I needed something solid because the
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting thing was great, but it's
unreliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: People around here, they say they're going
to pay and a lot of times they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started breeding seeds for retail
distribution and that's how iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was posting pictures online.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were loving my cannabis pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to make an iRegenetics Facebook
page and then iRegenetics really exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I began vending my seeds to a vendor known
as naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now known as thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have a little bit of my
products available right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you check them out,
thedankteam.com, you may be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some iRegenetics seeds from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started putting my seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a few cannabis cups and hustled
millions of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got millions of seeds out in the
planet now that are my fault that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: given away and or sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was noticing that I was getting a
little stagnant, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the seed company got going,
I started doing a podcast with my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a podcast called 719 the blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now defunct, but he was doing a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: One night I went to a comedy show and he
wanted to do a podcast after the comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: show and he didn't have anywhere to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this sweet table and I was like,
let's go to my house and record.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a podcast with Wade and I
honestly fell in love with podcasting
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that, but I did not like the
equipment that Wade had and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: approve of the quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: quality production that Wade was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of volunteered to help Wade
get his show up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought some recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already had some equipment because I'm a
drummer and a musician, but I bought a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple other add-ons for my equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a interface to make it work with
my MacBook, started podcasting,
[SPEAKER_00]: fell in love with podcasting with Wade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a couple of episodes that featured
cannabis and then he got tired of hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: about weed on his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made my own cannabis spinoff and now
we're here now at 112 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening to me rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This long and listening to 112 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then there were a bunch of
dispensaries opening up in my area and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was watching a lot of my friends and my
age group get really cool jobs at
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and it just kind of looked
like fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed the metamar days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed having coworkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working from home and private
facilities and I wasn't having the
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with the social interactions
that I missed that I desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, my buddy, Kevin, our old friend,
Kevin that used to be on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: he worked at the spot dispensary and he
kept putting in good words for me and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that they should hit me up and have
me be their grower because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: having issues with their master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept putting that off and putting
that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I decided I started dating a
girl named Angela and Angela got a job at
[SPEAKER_00]: the spot and talked about how much fun it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would have functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afro man came out to the spot and we got
to meet Afro man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they did a few other things that I
went to as a guest with Angela and I hung
[SPEAKER_00]: out and the spot crew was a bunch of fun
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really good time with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're all dirty minded dudes and I had
a really good time with Rob and with Dave
[SPEAKER_00]: and with Vegas and with the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really got along with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so one day Angela said, Hey,
they want you to come in and talk about a
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walked into the spot dispensary and
they're like, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner of Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been grown for this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding for this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I helped found the only dispensary in
the city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a podcast with this many
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had at the time an Instagram following
of like 15,000 followers, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I just threw down who I was and
what I did and they looked me straight in
[SPEAKER_00]: the face and they said, can you grow
hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told them, you know, I have very,
very little hydro experience, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure I can learn it because it's a
cannabis plant and I can learn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at each other like they
were impressed and they shook my hand and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said, how much money do you want to
make?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told them and they said,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kicked myself in the ass because I
showed a shot a lot higher since they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't budget all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, okay, we'll pay you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how I got into the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically uh, they knew who I was from
my buddy, Kevin, hyping them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Angela told me that they were
talking to her and that I should go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and hit them up for a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went in there and they gave me a job
on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Kevin, shout out to Angela
and shout out to the whole spot crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm not there anymore,
I have no ill will toward the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not my spot for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they didn't have any plants and I need
to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that puts me into the next phase of how
I got into the industry or where I am now
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I worked at the spot for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting their grow rooms up and running
and up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was struggling to find something to
keep myself busy with for 40 hours and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was on salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was expected to be doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught myself cleaning dog shit in the
parking lot one time and I thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I was like, not to be conceited,
but I was like, I'm a master grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I make one of the top
salaries in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I out here picking up dog shit and
not growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really started to like eat at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm doing things like sweeping
up dead bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fixing hanging shelves in the bud
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not here to be fucking
Felix fix it or fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felix from record Ralph, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day I was at work and our good
friend hunt from green and healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness sent me a text message and it
said, give me a call as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hunt doesn't really send out the SOS
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's like, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take dabs and you're free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said, as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I wasn't doing a damn thing at
the spot, anyway, I pulled out my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, Hey, uh, there was an
issue with my grower here and he no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: is employed and I need a master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, uh, he actually was
calling to ask if I had a partner or a
[SPEAKER_00]: minion that worked in my grows that I
would donate to him so that he could have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to work his grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what, hunt,
I want that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we agreed on a wage and a starting
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, about six weeks ago, it feels
like I took over as the lead cultivator at
[SPEAKER_00]: green and healthy wellness in Colorado,
Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right now the retail store,
you know, by the time this episode comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out, we'll be just a few days away from
the retail location opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the new location is on four 30 West
Colorado Avenue in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the old gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the Terp station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got some art in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we had a professional artist come and
do some beautiful art on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building is looking really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we will have a bunch of great product
around a February 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be harvesting the first round of
green and healthy wellness medicine grown
[SPEAKER_00]: by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff put this into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking good care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be ready pretty soon,
but that's where I am now in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's pretty much how I got in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I am today in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next breeding project will probably be
making an F2 version of the strain arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I will also add about four or five
other females into that selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will, so there will be some arise
F2s and then a couple of arise crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that come out of irie genetics in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do intend to keep this podcast going as
long as people will listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know lately it's been a little bit
unprepared, but that's because I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of hours at green and healthy
wellness, getting things put together
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely adjusting to my new
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting everything back in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shows are going to get back to,
to what they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that after episode a hundred,
we'd get back into the grow lessons and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode and the one next week are
just going to be me ranting about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think next week I'm going to talk a
little bit about what I do in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to kind of take you guys to
the grow room with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll walk into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about my chores that I do,
the things that I check.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about my personal grow and a
small home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about the large scale grow
at green and healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to talk about both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to do a checklist of things
that you guys should be doing on a daily,
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly and monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those will probably be the next two
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I feel like I'm ranting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep this podcast going is what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep breeding seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics will continue to come out
with new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep breeding my new stuff to my
old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the newest crosses that I find that I
really like will be bred into my lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep the podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at the cannabis cup for most of
the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are coming to the Denver
cannabis cup over the four 20 weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to be there Saturday and
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I will do my best to make an
appearance for four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot promise you anything with the way
the green and healthy wellness garden
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of work for myself,
but I love every single minute of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there will be some
collaborations coming up in the very near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be breeding some strains with some
other well-known breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be also creating strains for some
people who I can't even talk about right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that you know their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might listen to their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might watch their videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that you might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can't even talk about right now,
but there's some cool shit coming up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I feel like I've rambled for
a good 45 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just looked at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everybody for listening to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I came from in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you want to be part of the
cannabis industry with me, send me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see what you got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm open for collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up to advanced cannabis and my
cannabis career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys, I'm going to start
wrapping up the show.
