[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, I wanna thank you guys again for
[SPEAKER_00]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I wanna send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, took a little bit of
a nap and I woke up and I felt like I time
[SPEAKER_00]: traveled or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I felt like I was asleep for
17 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felt really strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever take a nap and you wake up and it
feels like it's been fucking forever and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know what happened, you don't
know where you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why the fuck am I on this couch in a
living room with the TV on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felt strange, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up on the couch watching
Ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember falling asleep to that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must've took some fat dabs, it must've
been a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking snow day here in Colorado,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is April 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a surprise snowstorm so I feel bad
for anybody who put their cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or any type of plants outside too early
because they got beat to shit last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about a foot of snow, maybe 16 or
18 inches worth of heavy, thick,
[SPEAKER_00]: cold, chunky fucking snow and it sure does
suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cold and windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power does keep cutting out so I
apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my recording cuts out here,
I'm using the MacBook and I've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: backup plans here so we'll get it going,
but I apologize if the power cuts out,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the video cuts out, there's nothing I
can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep the MacBook going and I will
keep recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I get some Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I don't have to drive to
Starbucks or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to go to work and make this
upload here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get any Wi-Fi soon,
it's maybe what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be going to Starbucks or driving to
the office to post this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just now thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, hopefully everything
cooperates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cold and shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I can get some technology on my
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of technology on my side,
holy shit, here's a weird thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a G-Nail from our friends at
Emotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys hear me talk about my
E-Nail all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the G-Nail made by Giddyup from
Emotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the power goes out, even if my E-Nail
is turned off, right now my E-Nail is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power button, the little button you
press, that red button, it is turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a press button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a toggle switch on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have that toggle switch on,
you're able to just grab that red button
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn on your G-Nail and you can take
dabs within like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the power goes off and comes back on,
when the power comes back on, it turns on
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking E-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really scary because if you just happen to
leave that sitting on the table or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that and it comes on,
it will catch on fire and it will burn
[SPEAKER_00]: your fucking house down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I discovered that a few weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cleaning up and I set the E-Nail
coil on the table and I unplugged it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up the table and I cleaned up
around it and then I plugged it back in
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few minutes later, I smelled
something funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, what's that smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like something's burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked around the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked around the dining room,
walked all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I came back to the dab table and I
was like, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing made sense to where it would
stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I was just looking
around the table and I could see the
[SPEAKER_00]: E-Nail glowing red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on an oil slick pad, which was the
only thing keeping my table from burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Oil
Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of prevented a little bit of a
fire and your product held up to some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's black underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a perfectly round scorch mark
where the E-Nail started to burn the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this Oil Slick pad held up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't ignite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it may have saved some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to our friends at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think that's fucking crazy that my
G-Nail comes on when the power comes back
[SPEAKER_00]: on like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got an E-Nail, whatever brand
you've got, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the power goes out, don't set it down
somewhere retarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave it somewhere weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be really careful, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to burn your shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that nap made me a
little bit goofy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm still a little bit groggy
in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at my show notes and they just
look like a bunch of little kid scribbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to figure out where the heck
I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everybody that listens on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Stitcher Radio, the podcast this week,
April 29th, the podcast was ranked number
[SPEAKER_00]: 687 out of 40,000 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 40,000 shows on Stitcher Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are ranked number 687.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me feel good inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the health and lifestyle
category, the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: was ranked number 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a category, we're ranked number 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're plus 57.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved 57 places up from last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in that health and lifestyle
top 100 for a few weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for keeping me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff to talk about you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an email I want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about some musical stuff
that people have been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the power keeps going out around
here, people have been asking me questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about the power and about interrupting
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that cannabis is based on
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes cannabis go to its flowering
phase is called its photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you reduce the lights to
approximately 12 hours on and 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: off, that will signal your plants to
flower because they think it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's coming toward the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to start kicking out buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to make seeds so they can
reproduce and do it all over again next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period is completely crucial to
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power keeps going out and people are
freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it is okay to interrupt your day
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lights are on, you can fuck that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn those lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be turning off the lights when
you're spraying most pesticides or most
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feeds or whatever booths you're
going to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights should go off for that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to turn off the lights during a
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to have a little bit of an
interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights are the number one nutrient that
your plants require and it's the number
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that makes them grow and live
and function and survive and do their
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesize is what they're trying to
do with that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you interrupt it for a little bit,
all they do is not get that growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: that vigor and that strength and that
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not interrupting anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not messing anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm making sure that I didn't bump
a button and stop the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going, so we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interrupt the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you cannot interrupt the night
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interrupting the dark cycle of flowering
plants will cause hermaphrodite problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you put your plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on from, it's 8.30 on my clock
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say they went to sleep at eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark cycle starts at eight o'clock p
.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and doesn't come back on until eight o
'clock a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot go in there and turn on a
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use your cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go in there and flip on a little
fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use a handheld flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants require 100% total darkness
for 12 hours or you will cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more sensitive at the start
of the flowering phase and then they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more sensitive toward the end of
the flowering phase in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not as sensitive, but still don't
fuck around and interrupt their dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will cause hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go extreme, they will revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will turn back around and go into
vege.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get real green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start looking like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds will get fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be tight compressed,
resinous buds like you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop going into grow rooms in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is okay to interrupt the day
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't interrupt the night cycle,
but you can interrupt the day cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do insist on going in your grow
room at night, here's one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself some green fluorescent
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get T5 bulbs that are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get T8 bulbs that are green and
they sell those little coily spun
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent light bulbs, the compact
fluorescent bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those in all of your normal light
receptacles so that way you can turn those
[SPEAKER_00]: on and you can work in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful coming in and out of that
room when the dark cycles happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be your own judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a couple of quick seconds won't hurt
you, but please just try to get the work
[SPEAKER_00]: done before the lights go off if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, I am super glad.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine needed some clones and I
had a plant that I was going to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm just not going to grow it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes up too much space and I've got
too many things to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine asked for some clones and
I am really glad that I was using
[SPEAKER_00]: RapidRooters instead of my EasyCloner this
round because the power was out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power was out for like seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went off around midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came back around three for a little
bit, but not long enough to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just long enough to make you think you're
going to get power and then it didn't come
[SPEAKER_00]: back until seven in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had been running hydroponics or if I
had been running EasyCloners, I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have lost several plants,
especially in the EasyCloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: New shit in the EasyCloner would not have
lasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've got to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do it, but that's why
you don't hear me for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's getting scratchy already.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like if without power for that
long in a hydroponic system, I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: really been having problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad for everybody who put their
plants out too early and everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: was running Hydro and got fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this makes me talk about analog
controllers over digital controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying digital controllers,
make sure they have a backup battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those analog timers, when... So think
about this, the power goes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally your lights are supposed to
come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about earlier, they'll come on
at eight in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go off at eight at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got one of those timers that
spins that you just push down the buttons
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the timer come on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the power goes out, that thing quit
spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your time is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't know what time it is anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the power comes back on, that thing's
going to be wherever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were three hours and 17 minutes
into your flowering period, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are now when that came on and your
whole cycle just changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time the power intermittently kicks
on and off, your timer moves a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights come on, the timer spins a
little bit, and then it goes back out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got seven more minutes of daylight
just happened in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the power goes out and I know it's
going to keep fucking up, I just go unplug
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it coming off and on and off
and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to hear...
[SPEAKER_00]: of your blowers and air conditioners
firing up and getting unplugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right as they start to die out,
the power comes again because the power
[SPEAKER_00]: guy's working on the line, pushing the
power together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whatever they're doing up there,
they're making it off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mess up my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop spinning and start spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a digital timer and there was a
battery backup, when the power went out in
[SPEAKER_00]: your house, the timer will remain on the
same time so that your cycles do not get
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's really
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a lot of digital stuff,
with a lot of programming comes the other
[SPEAKER_00]: caveat of when the power goes out,
how much of that stuff is going to fail
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why I keep grow rooms super
simple, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run pots of soil that I hand water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I've got lights, an air
conditioner, and a couple of blowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: all that I really rely on for electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else in my personal grow,
I do by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a large grow facility, I hope you're
automating a lot of stuff, but I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a backup plan also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's my talk about how the
snow fucked everybody up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about those analog and digital
timers, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to buy a timer next time,
get a digital timer with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when the power goes out,
your whole cycle doesn't get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the power starts going out,
coming back off and on and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: just go and plug everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will survive for a little
while in the dark without any
[SPEAKER_00]: interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably better for your equipment,
your plants, your power bill, all that
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff if you're not sucking up a
bunch of random power at random intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably freaks your plants out
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, how come we just got four
minutes of light and then it went dark
[SPEAKER_00]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you're going to have to
worry about, it got cold here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants were getting cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing I could really do about
that that I could think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I was going to burn a fucking fire
in the house, there's not much I could
[SPEAKER_00]: really do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a fireplace here,
so that was not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, humidity was building up in one
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was just open the doors and just
let the air move around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interrupt that day cycle,
but please do not interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your night cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been rambling
for like 12 minutes and I still need a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hit pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink, fix what's
going on in my throat, and I'll be right
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I took a couple of fat dabs
while I had the microphone turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way nobody could hear me coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I dabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, I took some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some live resin, some clementine
live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of buttery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes super delicious, but it does not
give me enough effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give me the head buzz that I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make me high like I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good morning hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get a little bit buzzed the
first thing in the morning and not ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole day, this clementine is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also kind of like drinking some
orange juice in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since it doesn't get me where I want
to be, I take a decent size chunk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clementine live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the clementine live resin
came from, I'm pretty sure that was TR
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked it up at Three Rivers Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all of those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I've been taking Golden Goat
Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat was grown by myself and
extracted by our friend, the barefoot
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, the barefoot, barefoot extracts is
who he is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the barefoot grower, the barefoot
glass blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's barefoot extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be the barefoot husband
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he makes great hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been smoking the clementine
wrapped up in Golden Goat Shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: making little turp tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat certainly does give me the
head buzz I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The citrus flavor of the Golden Goat,
that sweet citrusy, tropical flavor mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, that is a super delicious dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it puts me, obviously it puts me in a
nice rambly, talkative head space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to everybody involved there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three Rivers Organics, Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Apothecary or TR?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever made this, he did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also earlier today dabbing some
Lemon Jeffrey and that was made by
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also putting the Lemon Jeffrey in
the Golden Goat because I've got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of this Golden Goat Shatter and it
really does great things to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also smoking on some Kalanji Kush
mixed with Zach Hayes Shatter that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out super clear, super gold, super
shattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice dabs with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work to our friend, Barefoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not in Colorado, if you're not
in a legal state, I apologize for rubbing
[SPEAKER_00]: it into your face, all the good shit that
I get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching the video that I'm
making, the reason the camera just moved
[SPEAKER_00]: is because I was making sure I was
recording the audio track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did mention video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been recording most of the new
episodes onto video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've purchased an iPad and I'm recording
everything directly onto the iPad with the
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running iRig from my recording
software into the iPad so that everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is a quality audio recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting all of the videos up to
YouTube, but I'm going very slowly about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also putting them up in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now episodes one through 30 are
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys are able to see one
through 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get one through 50, I'll release
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put the next 25 up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few videos are not going to be
that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making them to get them caught up
so that the old episodes will always be
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube does not limit how many videos you
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can put all 200 episodes of the
podcast up on YouTube and they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: kept there always and forever until they
take them down for copyright violations
[SPEAKER_00]: for having music in the background,
which I hope doesn't ever happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people ask for the old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been putting out those chunks of
old episodes on Thursdays with three and
[SPEAKER_00]: four episodes, but that's just messing up
the feed and making more shit fall out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more episodes are disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to put them up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video will end up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only up to like 32 that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little while you
guys, but since I'm making them live while
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing them now, hopefully that speeds
me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if you can't watch on video,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not missing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you see is my rambling face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I'm super duper high and I
forgot to mention why green lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past segment, I talked about using
green lights when you go into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room during the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are green lights okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is a green light special?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I use a purple or a blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain it briefly and quickly and
really simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not absorb green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green light doesn't affect them in any
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, since they're green,
they don't absorb green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't reflect green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why green is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the quick and easy reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're green also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that works for you because that's
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes ago on 420, actually on the
420 episode, I wanted to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked my listeners, what are you
listening to when you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get dabbed out, when you smoke a
blunt, when you smoke some flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smoke whatever your preferred
smoking device or delivery method is,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get done getting nice and blazed,
what kind of music do you listen to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Barry Oh, who's been a long
time podcast listener, shout out Barry Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for listening for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the interaction on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything you do for being
part of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My listeners need a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Stanhope has the killer termites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my listeners called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Create a name for yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'd love to know what my followers
and listeners are called.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Barry Oh listens to, when Barry Oh gets
nice and blazed, he likes to listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: Coltrane with Buddy Rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Coltrane with Buddy Rich,
that's good shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all about some Buddy Rich,
some Gene Krupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, wasn't Buddy Rich an asshole?
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't Buddy Rich smoke a joint,
chill the fuck out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy Rich was one of the best drummers on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wore a full suit jacket tie and played
faster and harder than I can ever do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played longer shows than I can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old man would be covered in fucking
sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played till he was over 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was probably 80 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Mr. Buddy Rich,
but holy shit, that dude could play some
[SPEAKER_00]: drums, but I've heard recordings of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yelling at his band.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one band member missed one note in that
show, when they got back on the bus,
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy Rich would chew out that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would cuss at them and make them feel
like the dumbest pieces of shit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Buddy Rich needed to smoke a
fucking joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he wouldn't have been the
aggressive, crazy, angry, fast drummer
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was, but man, it would have helped
him out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why some of those other guys
were fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they did smoke a little too much
weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy Rich was a badass drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy Rich and Coltrane, that's some cool
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go listen to some of that in the car
a little bit later here, because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: like that feeling in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get driving, you get the horns going
and the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love some good jazzy shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Berrio likes to listen to some
Coltrane with Buddy Rich when he gets
[SPEAKER_00]: high, but also, he's going to make a huge
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also likes to listen to Bad Brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some punk feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a reggae feel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad Brains was a punk band who became
Rastafarians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it, but Sublime kind of rips
off Bad Brains a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the Misfits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't be an old punk fan if you
don't listen to the Misfits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, you see that black
t-shirt with a skull on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All you hipster kids, all you young
fuckers, that black shirt with the white
[SPEAKER_00]: skull on it, that's the Misfits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a band a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should probably check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got black hair and you're wearing
your sister's pants, definitely go listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Misfits and learn where the fuck it
all came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you said Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennywise is good shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not quite up my alley, but that's
good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Misfits, Pennywise, Bad Brains,
that is good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never put it on, but in the
circles I used to hang with and friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used to hang out with, there was a
lot of that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend who was way into bad
religion, which also fell into that
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my kind of music, but one of my
favorites in that realm would be No
[SPEAKER_00]: Effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just liked the tone of their drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these bands have terrible
sounding drums on the recordings,
[SPEAKER_00]: and being a drummer, it disappoints me
when the guitar sounds like, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good, and the bass is like, but then the
drums sound like you're hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking the desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune the goddamn drums and record them
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Effects always had the drums sounding
good, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge shout out to the song Shower
Days, that's right, from No Effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesdays and Saturdays, also known as
Shower Days, that used to be how I rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling on about Barry O's tweet
about music, but dude, thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to know what people are listening
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's never too late to send me a
tweet or a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you like to listen to
when you get high, when you smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of music do you put on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you one of those guys, the cliche guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you put on some Pink Floyd and sit back
and zone out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like to watch Cheech and Chong
movies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what entertains you when you
get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to know what you're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you smoking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer a blunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer a bong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like to take dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite delivery method?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I ask a lot of questions,
but I appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a little long and a little
wordy, but I think it's worth the read,
[SPEAKER_00]: so hang in here with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: While my email handle, should I even say
that out loud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm supposed to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has a very unique email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say it, because it's
part of the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: While my email handle, Catalina Belmar,
may evoke visions of a young Barcelona
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real author of this email is an old
bald man living in a prohibition state
[SPEAKER_00]: that rarely has the opportunity to
indulge, but who dreams of his occasional
[SPEAKER_00]: forays into the mountains of Colorado and
the opportunity to partake of the herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine available back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat from Earls of Leadville last
autumn was my last favorite while climbing
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of 14ers nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the stutter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not written like a normal email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very poetic, and there's a lot of
stuff to adjust to in the reading here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhythm is not my style, so it took me
three or four reads to figure it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like the way it's worded,
so I'm going to read it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I too enjoy listening
to Reggae and the Grateful Dead and Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lean toward older Reggae, having had the
opportunity to attend Bob Marley concerts
[SPEAKER_00]: twice in my younger days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others I like are Tosh, Toots and the
Maytals, Mighty Diamonds, Max Romeo,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Other Marleys, Luton Faya,
Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picked up some Marlon Asher after
listening to your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we listen to the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are loving the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't listen to Bob Marley as much as I
could or probably should because it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: so overplayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bugs me when people see that I have
dreadlocks and they go, oh, I love Bob
[SPEAKER_00]: Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of burns it out for me,
so I listen to a lot of other stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we listen to a lot of the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of jealous that you saw Bob Marley in
concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen plenty of video and the dude was
powerful on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have been in his presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would really enjoy Steel Pulse by the
bands you listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know about Steel Pulse,
but check out some Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Morgan's grandchildren and
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to go that route,
check out Jamiri Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the new generation of Morgan's,
but Morgan Heritage definitely falls into
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff of good reggae that I think you
would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go on with your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you mentioned Government Mule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard Mule's dub side of
The Mule, you are missing a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mule is joined by Toots Hibbert for a
real reggae mule style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I love Government Mule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Warren Haynes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get into that dub side album for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the dub side of The Moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool one, but the dub side
of The Mule just doesn't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to sound like an asshole, but Toots is
not my favorite reggae artist,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably a bunch of Rastas and
reggae fans probably just slapped
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves right in the forehead and went,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the more, I don't know,
the more reggae feeling reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toots is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love Toots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him in concert several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the band is called Horseshoes and Hand
Grenades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it's hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Yonder Mountain's always good for
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually played Yonder Mountain on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Granny Won't You Smoke Some
Marijuana when I had the Devin Granny on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yonder's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get too much into the bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I lived in Lawrence, Kansas,
I hung out with a girl who was a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: bluegrass fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there was reggae at one bar and
bluegrass at another bar, we knew we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't hanging out that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that she was going to go see
bluegrass and I was going to go check out
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the night, we'd end up
at the same place wherever the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmopolitics were playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Cosmopolitics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes on to say Grateful Dead
and Phish are of course mainstays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phish and the Grateful Dead are always
going to be my two favorite bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, try Holly Bowling
playing Phish's Tahoe Tweezer on piano
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently there's an artist named
Holly Bowling who plays a song called
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweezer on piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holly Bowling playing Tweezer on piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're Phish kids and you're
listening to this, go check that out for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I hope to catch you under
Mountain String Band with Government Mule
[SPEAKER_00]: at Red Rocks this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a cool show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not planning on going to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chance I may end up at that
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know if I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll link up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs together and smoke
some irie genetics grown flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, peace and
continue your great streaming of important
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis related info and entertainment to
those of us in Prohibition Land signed
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a very uniquely written email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way you write shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't talk like normal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a very poetic way with your
email here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like we like a lot of the same
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have introduced me to this Holly
Bowling character that I'm going to check
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I may listen to some Yonder
Mountain because I haven't listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: that in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I do listen to?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to listen to that,
that banjo-y shit, I'd probably put on
[SPEAKER_00]: some leftover salmon or some string cheese
incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of burn myself up on the string
cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer of 2001, I saw a bunch of
widespread panic shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a short run there where
string cheese and panic were co-headlining
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would take one night cheese with
headline and the next night panic with
[SPEAKER_00]: headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just open for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a whole bunch of string cheese,
a whole bunch of widespread panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to Bonnaroo and saw string
cheese and they sounded like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of got it together by the next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I went to Wacarusa and saw string
cheese at Wacarusa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was when they added the new
percussion guy, Jason Hahn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like what I used to love about
string cheese incident was the way Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: Travis played the drums and percussion at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel when they added the new
percussionist, Mike Travis got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit lazy and that was what was bringing
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what I loved was watching that
drummer play and that keyboard player,
[SPEAKER_00]: keyboardist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said keyboard playist, but that keyboard
player, Kyle Hollingsworth is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that percussion thing from the drummer
was what drew me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they changed it, it kind of lost
me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check and make sure that
iTunes is or that GarageBand is still
[SPEAKER_00]: going strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 27 minutes into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling a lot this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for all of the rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame all the rambles on the
golden goat and Clementine dabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly this bottle of Dr. Pepper here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get a little caffeinated,
get a little dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face just likes to start going real
fast, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's good for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to start
wrapping up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was a short episode and there
was not a whole lot of learning to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fun hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the 420 season and the little cold
that I had, I did not have a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: to put together a super impressive
episode, but it was fun hanging out with
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Catalina and Barry O for
their replies to my questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys send me some responses to
what you like to smoke on, what you like
[SPEAKER_00]: to snack on, and how your favorite way to
medicate goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said how your favorite way goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started talking and didn't know what the
fuck I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I need to wrap up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I will be back in
seven days with a higher quality episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also be back on Thursday with a large
chunk of old episodes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you guys are listening to
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know what you think of the
Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you enjoying those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a waste of my time and they're a
waste of your time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they hard for you to download since
they are three hours long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mess up your service?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mess up your data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mess up your phone plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it working for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a better way that I could do that
for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, I'm going to put all the old
episodes up on YouTube, so they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget about Patreon,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a service where you can
contribute to the podcast financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
dollar of your time, simply go to patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash grow from your heart,

[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep talking about, all of the old
episodes are slowly coming up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also love it if you find me on all
of the social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stalk me on Twitter at
GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into all the social media
and you would like to send me an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can reach me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from each and every
single one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I've got for you this
week, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me for 30
minutes for a short, brief episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a little bit about
cannabis light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got to have fun hanging out
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back in seven days with a fully
prepared episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I get to go post this without any
trouble because I don't have any Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to drive up to the Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to go to the office and use
their computer, steal some Wi-Fi up there
[SPEAKER_00]: to get this show up for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Rich Milohan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's like a free for all here and the
owner should maybe come down here and see
[SPEAKER_04]: if he can secure his business if he wants
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our own PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let you hear it today.
It's getting
[SPEAKER_03]: harder and harder and harder, each and
their mother and their kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw when she came out, she was dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said it was for the black man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said it was for the Mexican,
but not for the white man.
