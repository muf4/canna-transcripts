[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host my friends call me Rasta
Jeff I want to thank you guys again for
[SPEAKER_00]: joining me as always I need to send a huge
thank you shout out to my friends in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their
music on my podcast big shout out to Kat
[SPEAKER_00]: Kuth and the entire Mystic Roots crew
ladies and gentlemen I'm recording on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday June 27th and it was a hundred
degrees outside today in Colorado I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: you survived I hope you've got your air
conditioning situation figured out I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing went too hot in your grow room I
hope you were staying hydrated it was hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to dab today you guys I felt like when I
took dabs my brain was just cooking it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a long hot day happy summer everybody
happy summer welcome to the summer it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a long hot summer I hope you're
prepared get some air conditioning fans
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't gonna cut it you need to replace
that hot air with fresh cool air you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool down the hot air a fan is just
gonna blow that heat around and piss your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants off so figure out some air
conditioning for your grow room soon
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies and gentlemen because it's only
going to get hotter also speaking of heat
[SPEAKER_00]: if you hear a little rattle noise in the
background a little fluttering sound that
[SPEAKER_00]: of course is the air conditioner that is
the only thing keeping me sane right now I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize if that is interrupting the
podcast without that I may go crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: smash some shit to tell you the truth it's
too fucking hot I hate the heat I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of the heat which sucks because when
it gets cold I'm gonna bitch and complain
[SPEAKER_00]: about the cold also I wish we could just
have a nice even climate and make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything iry that's what I wish ladies
and gentlemen welcome to the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for joining me thanks for listening
to me ramble on for a couple of minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: already I do have a podcast planned for
you before we get there I want to give a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge thanks to some people on the last
episode or two episodes ago actually I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that I have bred a new strain
and that I was growing the seeds and that
[SPEAKER_00]: that new project needs a name I got a lot
of responses through Instagram through
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter through email a lot of people
responded the cross that I'm looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: name for is flow from DJ short that's
right I've got a clone of DJ shorts flow
[SPEAKER_00]: and I pollinated that with my mail arise
and I need a name for flow cross to arise
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people have sent suggestions
there's some good stuff in there I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea actually came up with a good
idea on my own that may get used but I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't decided yet so if you've got a
name that you'd like to submit for
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration for this or maybe if you've
got a word that you just like to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be a strain name send it to me
let me know somehow contact me via email
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a girl from your heart at hotmail.com
you can send it to me on Twitter at GF YH
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast or if we happen to be Instagram
friends if you follow me on Instagram you
[SPEAKER_00]: can send it to me on Instagram my
Instagram account is iry underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that's right I read genetics
that's me on Instagram so if you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea for flow cross to the arise flows the
email arises the mail something that means
[SPEAKER_00]: like upward flowing energy is kind of what
I'm looking for I've got a word in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not certain it's not a like a real
easy to say word or real popular word so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if I want to put that label on
there but you never know I might do that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do weird shit with my strain names I like
one word names I like cool stuff reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: related grateful dead related positive
moving words stuff like that it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm going with it anyway send me
your suggestions grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com at GF YH podcast on Twitter or
iry underscore genetics on Instagram or of
[SPEAKER_00]: course there's the Facebook simply grow
from your heart podcast on Facebook I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to know your suggestions also on the last
episode I talked about the screen of green
[SPEAKER_00]: technique that episode went up Monday and
this morning Tuesday when I woke up I
[SPEAKER_00]: checked my email and this is in my email
it says hey thanks for the podcast man you
[SPEAKER_00]: answered my question spot-on I'm going to
use the trellis on my next grow thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining in a simple way I'm gonna skip
the next couple lines because it reveals
[SPEAKER_00]: too much about you and I'm not sure that
you want people to know who you are and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a little personal so I'm gonna skip
that and then you say I will probably bug
[SPEAKER_00]: you in the future with a question if you
got time thanks again man your show has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a lifesaver love being able to listen
be love being able to learn from a good
[SPEAKER_00]: source thanks for the hard work you put in
it man dude bug me with more questions
[SPEAKER_00]: please you were not bugging me at all I
love listener generated content that lets
[SPEAKER_00]: me know that I am hitting my target
audience I was able to answer a question
[SPEAKER_00]: and put out a great podcast at the same
time I'm sure I helped you with your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully I helped a whole bunch of other
people now that information is out there
[SPEAKER_00]: without your inspiration that episode
would not have happened so it works
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly for both of us I got some
content you got to learn something so
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks a lot for your help please ask me
more questions you say you'll probably bug
[SPEAKER_00]: me in the future you're never bugging me
that's what I'm here for I want to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow a better herb then you say thanks
I've been a lifesaver that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome to know I like saving lives
hopefully saving the lives of lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants improving the lives of
lots of ganja plants and then you said
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for the hard work dude you're very
welcome thanks for noticing thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching out and if you ever have more
questions please please please email me
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how to do it you just sent me
this email grow from your heart at hotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com thanks again for the email I think I
just called you G on the last episode
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know if you want me to say
your name or not but G big up G thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: that message perfect timing right just
song ends also all right I do have another
[SPEAKER_00]: email that I want to get into we're just
gonna read a couple of emails on this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode why not I like all this listener
generated content like I said that lets me
[SPEAKER_00]: know that I'm helping somebody out if you
ask me this question you obviously need
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer so I'm trying to get through as
many of these emails as I can and give
[SPEAKER_00]: them solid answers so let's get right into
this one this one starts off in big bold
[SPEAKER_00]: capital letters please try not to use my
real name in my email address if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: this in the podcast then he says if you do
it's cool enough super worried thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: homie then he goes on to say and don't
worry bro I'm not gonna say your name I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: keep you undercover you can be incognito
with me he goes on to say sort of longtime
[SPEAKER_00]: listener here I love listening to you and
the gang get high as fuck and do your
[SPEAKER_00]: throwback podcast they've been great for
relistening while I set up a new grow I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing underground in Illinois until
the last couple of years then took a break
[SPEAKER_00]: so things have changed for sure just to
kind of explain what this guy is talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about he said I do like your throwback
podcasts on Thursdays I've been putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out what I call throwback Thursday
episodes where I take chunks of old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes usually three four maybe five
episodes and I put them into one chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: one file and then I post that up to iTunes
and Stitcher and wherever else it goes my
[SPEAKER_00]: website I read genetics Colorado comm
which that website sucks you guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize the website is kind of a piece
of shit it needs some love I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time or motivation to work on that the
podcast works that's what we need so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's there but I put up the episodes and
they're old episodes I
[SPEAKER_00]: am also putting them up on YouTube but
that's taking me a little while I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: the first 60 videos up on YouTube but I've
been putting out the old throwback
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday episodes so that people can go
back and listen to that because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some great episodes in there from about
episode 50 to about a hundred there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some really golden episodes like
scheduling a perpetual harvest and just
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff along those lines lots of improving
harvest and harvest weights stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that episode 50 is one of my favorite
episodes personally but those those aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: in the feed anymore so I've been throwing
those old episodes back in chunks so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if I put that way when I put three
episodes out I'm only losing one episode
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are three freshies for somebody
to listen to I'm trying to keep content
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh for you guys and as I'm going I'm
making videos for YouTube I'm just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the grow from your heart podcast
logo up on the screen and then running the
[SPEAKER_00]: audio in the background I'm doing very
little to the videos I just want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them out there so that they're listenable
I will catch up thanks for being patient
[SPEAKER_00]: with me on that holy crap that's a lot of
ranting let me slap myself in the face and
[SPEAKER_00]: get back focused you do like the throwback
Thursday podcast thank you because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a lot of work it takes my computer
a long time to process that big of a file
[SPEAKER_00]: put it together kind of takes me a minute
so I'm glad you appreciate that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: great for listening while setting up a new
grow yes I love listening to podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: while setting up a new grow just helps me
get in the zone I get in the flow I'm glad
[SPEAKER_00]: you're listening to my show I appreciate
that you've been growing underground in
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois until the last couple years so
things have certainly changed yes they
[SPEAKER_00]: have I hope you get some cool shit going
out there stay safe be careful follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules and then let me know how it goes for
you then you do have some questions let me
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the first question it says just a
couple of questions what are your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on LED setups I can't recall you talking
much about them or was I too stoned and
[SPEAKER_00]: missed it but I'm curious my thoughts on
LED setups honestly I don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: personal experience growing under LEDs I
have grown under Gavitas I have grown
[SPEAKER_00]: under t5s I have grown under high-pressure
sodiums I have grown under metal halides
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do not have any personal experience
with LED lighting I have seen some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: crops grown under LED lights my friend
Nancy Budwell is a was I'm not sure if she
[SPEAKER_00]: still is I don't want to speak out of line
but Nancy Budwell was a rep for lush
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting for quite a while and her lush
lights were putting out very beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: crops she's growing some firefly right now
under lush lights and it looks very
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful she took some amazing pictures
of bounty killer that were grown under her
[SPEAKER_00]: lush lights and they were gorgeous so I
don't know enough about any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: brands to love or hate them what I do know
is that if you're getting a quality light
[SPEAKER_00]: that's putting out the right lighting the
right colors the right spectrum and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wired properly and it's safe I've seen
some good shit happen I've also seen
[SPEAKER_00]: people buy cheap shitty lights and it just
makes their plants look like shit so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what brands to recommend but if
you can do some research and eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap brands you could probably grow a
decent crop with an LED light is my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion I don't have any firsthand
experience so this is not my area of
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise but I've seen it done and I've
seen Nancy grow some great herb I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: a few other people grow a great herb under
LED lighting I just haven't done it so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking to save money on
electricity on cooling and if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: grown for yourself in like a closet or a
spare bedroom or something and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do a big production crop to like
pay the rent or something if you're just a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical patient trying to grow your own
medicine and LED should be perfect for you
[SPEAKER_00]: two LEDs one for vegging one for flowering
you should be right where you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's that's pretty much all I know
about LEDs is they're better for smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: setups I saw sub cool do a side-by-side he
ran his normal light his thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodiums and then he put an
LED in one section of the room and he said
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had to feed the plants differently
they were underneath the LED which I would
[SPEAKER_00]: believe because they will photosynthesize
differently because they are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different spectrums of light so
you may have to change your feeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have to change your flowering
times and your veg times but it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial and that's I wish I had more
info for you but I've never done it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to talk out of my ass any more
than I just did so question number two I
[SPEAKER_00]: came across the idea of having a grow that
works as a small scale assembly line for
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of better term the general idea is to
have 12 to 16 plants total one for every
[SPEAKER_00]: week a plant is alive so you want to have
your plants alive for 12 to 16 weeks total
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes sense you got about a nine
week flower time then probably four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five weeks of veg onto that that's putting
you at 14 weeks and then two more weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: as a clone is 16 weeks so you can shave
off whatever you need to hit your 12 but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a 16 week plant life which is
acceptable then you go on to say planting
[SPEAKER_00]: one every week harvesting one every week
moving one to veg every week etc other
[SPEAKER_00]: than not being able to deep clean do
repairs between cycles are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with this way of growing should I
even try something like this then you wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: it up by saying I hope the second question
is clear enough I'm based in Durango so I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope I can meet you and dab you out
sometime I have way more questions but I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel bad you have to read my rambles this
far so until next time Durango Durango
[SPEAKER_00]: great question dude the question number
two right here I love this this is this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a great question and this is clear you are
very well spoken you wouldn't believe some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the emails I get dude you wouldn't
believe some of the people I speak to send
[SPEAKER_00]: me more shit I like the way you write I
can tolerate you I want more send me more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I want to hear them now let me
answer your question yes this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking idea this is kind of I run a giant
commercial not a giant I run a
[SPEAKER_00]: medium-sized commercial grow and this is
the idea we don't do things every day we
[SPEAKER_00]: do things in about three week cycles
because we cut down a lot of herb it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: us an entire week to finish a harvest we
have a whole trim crew come on Friday they
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down every plant in the room it's
usually one room is a hundred and twenty
[SPEAKER_00]: six plants the bigger room is a hundred
and sixty eight plants or somewhere around
[SPEAKER_00]: there so between a hundred and twenty five
and a hundred and seventy ish plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we cut down at a time they cut it all
down on one day it hangs upside down they
[SPEAKER_00]: do that on Friday then they come back
Monday usually ish or they'll cut down on
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday come back Friday depends on their
schedule we have an outside trim crew that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes shout out to the trim crew if you're
listening thanks for helping us out they
[SPEAKER_00]: come and they chop it down on Monday hangs
upside down then on Friday they come and
[SPEAKER_00]: buck all the buds off of the sticks into
buckets and then the next Monday they come
[SPEAKER_00]: and start trimming it all up and it
usually takes them until Friday to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes on Friday they get off early but
usually on Friday it's a scramble to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that last bit of bud trimmed up so it's a
40-hour work week trimming our weed so we
[SPEAKER_00]: only cut down and we have three flowering
rooms so we cut down about every three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks is our cycle so yes this is what you
want you want to always have things
[SPEAKER_00]: running I want to know why do you want to
do one plant constantly instead of having
[SPEAKER_00]: the room come down all at once that's a
thought that I would put into this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know why because I'm a grower and I'm
experienced but I want you to think to
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself why you want to do this instead
of taking down 12 or 16 plants at once and
[SPEAKER_00]: then having a pound of herb as opposed to
having an ounce every week and I get why
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to smoke an ounce a week
and it's easier to trim an ounce every
[SPEAKER_00]: week instead but you're gonna have this is
gonna create constant work which is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad thing but if you fuck up then your
rhythm is fucked up if you if one clone
[SPEAKER_00]: dies or if one plant goes wrong or if you
can't do something right then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really screwed also this locks you into a
cycle to where you can only grow one
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that fits this program so this is a
good idea yes this is kind of the goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: production to one in one out constantly
but the way I would recommend you say 16
[SPEAKER_00]: plants here I would do four plants at a
time just to keep it that way you have
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can put some weeks a week of
space four weeks of space or something in
[SPEAKER_00]: there two weeks of space instead of every
Monday cutting a clone cutting a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: down and it sounds awesome yes but it's
gonna get tedious and it's gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming and when it gets tedious and
overwhelming that's when the love comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it that's what I believe in this
has got some connection to you somehow and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to put love into it anything that
you put love into grows better anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you nourish properly grows better and then
I think it's better to if you're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: recreationally you're medicating because
you feel better and it's even if it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: to make your mind smile and make your
that's that's a medical treatment to
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a relief in some way you
you're you're it's it's relief in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion so it needs to be nourished as a
medical product there is a real a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to put into our bodies
and it will medicate us better so you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat your plants with love and I think
if you have too much of a production the
[SPEAKER_00]: love kind of falls out and I may be a
fucking hippie for thinking that and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool maybe you don't believe that
there needs to be love in your plants I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not singling you I'm not saying I'm maybe
other people don't believe there needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be love maybe I've got a good friend who
I'll see him tomorrow afternoon he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: love the plants he knows that that's a
production line this is a product and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow this product it's a
commodity we will cut it down we will sell
[SPEAKER_00]: it we will do more he doesn't love the
plants I love the plants I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something you should do sorry I might get
sidetracked because I love the plants but
[SPEAKER_00]: yes so your your idea is perfect but I
would do instead of doing 16 plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing one every week I would kind of break
it down into four in four out that way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get three weeks of not having to trim
because if you're gonna have to trim one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant every week and then you're gonna
have one plant curing that's been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar for a little bit you're gonna have to
burp that jar and I don't know how big
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are gonna be but it's gonna be
a lot of work it's gonna be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: excess work if you chop thing the
harvesting things in larger batches is
[SPEAKER_00]: just easier for burping and stuff like
that but I'm not trying to shoot down your
[SPEAKER_00]: idea if you are dedicated and you think
you want to do that if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: another job and if you don't have a busy
life this would be fucking awesome for you
[SPEAKER_00]: this would not work for me I am way too
busy to chop down a plant every week cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone every week it just seems tedious to
me but that is the idea what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting at is ultimately the idea there
are large grows in Colorado that work on
[SPEAKER_00]: basically this plan they put but they do
it every week every Monday plants go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants come down every Monday plants
go in plants come down and that's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just crew and you're all right the only
downside to it is not being able to deep
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and do repairs but there's nothing
stopping you from pulling every plant out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that room or over to one side of the
room and cleaning the shit out of where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can and then move the plants the other
side of the room clean the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can or you've got 12 hours
during a flowering cycle you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do just about any kind of repairs
you need to do during a 12-hour cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my opinion I don't know I don't
know how physically able you are what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of work skills you've got but most stuff
that needs to be done in their cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: wise you can take down I have taken down
an entire room Mike and I have taken down
[SPEAKER_00]: every bit of ducting every light pulled
out the flooring redid the flooring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room we actually painted the whole room
with kills read it all the ducting we did
[SPEAKER_00]: it all in 12 hours those plants didn't
skip a day they didn't miss a minute of
[SPEAKER_00]: their night cycle they were all back on
the right cycle so I think it can be done
[SPEAKER_00]: just about however big the room is you may
need a friend it's got to dedicate and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're down to do this fucking 16 plants
every 16 weeks idea you got to be down to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and do stuff like that sounds like
you're a savage Durango whenever you're up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Pueblo area or if you're in Denver
or Colorado Springs hit me up I'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: dab with you I go to a lot of comedy shows
and stuff like that so if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy shows if you're going to any of the
the fish shows bro it sounds like you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be going to fish a lot of folks from
Durango come up to see fish look for me
[SPEAKER_00]: hit me up we'll take some dads together
ladies and gentlemen I'm sure you can hear
[SPEAKER_00]: my throat doing that thing where it's
getting dry I'm gonna press pause for well
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna pause for several minutes I'm
gonna take a couple of dads I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: drink some water and then I'll be right
back and we will read some more emails
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I am back podcast world guess what my
head is vibrating whoo yeah I just took a
[SPEAKER_00]: big old gigantic dab of some lemon skunk
dunked in lemon Jeffrey high terpene full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extracts and it tastes like I
just ate an entire so if you took the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered sugar stuff off of a lemon head
just the lemon candy flavor and just
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated that into one bite like the
whole the powder from one bag it tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: like I just ate that much of that flavor
it's strong on my tongue like it tastes as
[SPEAKER_00]: lemons and there's like this real smooth
flavor I really enjoyed that but yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: is intense holy crap I was talking to the
friend today and we all agree that lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: and limonene stuff and lemon flavored
turps are really good for your head injury
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you got a head injury you guys we
can all recommend the limonene and lemony
[SPEAKER_00]: turps that just makes my head feel better
I talked about that on a recent episode
[SPEAKER_00]: but somebody else agreed with me all right
I'm gonna get my shit together I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the email from our friend
Durango thanks for the email if you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: want to email me send me an email grow
from your heart at hotmail.com I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer your grow questions but I want to
remind you that I think it was episode
[SPEAKER_00]: number 73 was all about scheduling a
perpetual grow and it was basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: you were talking about but it was using a
5x5 flowering space and another 5x5 space
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed that to pull down one plant every
four weeks is what I think I was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately that episode is not in the
feed because like I rambled about earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes
but I am very close to getting that up on
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes so bear with me and within the next
few weeks here we'll get that up on iTunes
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone can listen to the scheduling
a perpetual grow episode all right I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got another email here on my phone this
one I found very interesting a few
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes ago I spoke of my head injury I
don't want to ramble on about it right now
[SPEAKER_00]: for too long but about two and a half
years ago I suffered a traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury I I'm six foot five and I walked
through a doorway that apparently was six
[SPEAKER_00]: foot two and it knocked me the fuck out I
don't remember hitting I remember thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go get a chair it's at the
bottom of those stairs and then I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sounded like a symbol crash maybe
a little bit of lightning maybe a tailgate
[SPEAKER_00]: of a truck slamming and I remember being
at the bottom of the stairs and all my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends sang my name and I was like what
why the fuck do you keep saying my name
[SPEAKER_00]: then I was like why am I on the floor I
fucked myself up I knocked myself clean
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck out I was not right for a long
time I spoke about it on a recent podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to go too far into it right
here but I'm much better now much better I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I'm way better now I ramble a
lot now but I feel like I'm way better
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway a listener wanted to email me and I
found this to be a very great email it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this Rasta Jeff I heard your
podcast on TBI and what happened to you
[SPEAKER_00]: much love bro I suffer from chronic PTSD
and my doctor suggested I try THC it has
[SPEAKER_00]: changed my life and my outlook on it your
podcast puts a positive note to the change
[SPEAKER_00]: we all want to see so far so good right
you guys this guy suffers from chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD I've got a little bit of PTSD from I
had a friend who discovered they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure disorder she wasn't my friend
she's my girlfriend I lived with her and
[SPEAKER_00]: we discovered that she had a seizure
disorder and her seizures were fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible and I wasn't prepared to live
with that at that time in my life and I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched that person have some serious
medical problems and it fucked me up I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think I've ever talked about that on
a podcast but I've got some PTSD from
[SPEAKER_00]: watching a girlfriend from my past have
grand mal seizures and nearly die multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times so I've got some PTSD and I believe
that the THC kind of it doesn't allow
[SPEAKER_00]: those shitty thoughts to come up when they
do you could be and I know that's a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: way to cover your problems but it does
kind of the PTSD triggers weird shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes other emotions start going and it
gives you more things and it stops that so
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that it does work it does change
your life and I'm glad that it changed
[SPEAKER_00]: your outlook on it and dude I am glad that
my podcast puts a positive note because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what that's what I try to do I try
to be a good ambassador for this plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: that means a lot to me here's the part of
the email that everybody is gonna go wow
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz I really did this listener says I am a
former law enforcement officer and never
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I would be using THC so sad to
know how ignorant I was for all those
[SPEAKER_00]: years thank God I found cannabis and added
it to my daily life dude I am very
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful that you have found cannabis and
added it to your daily life it's helping
[SPEAKER_00]: with your PTSD it helped me with my head
injury it helped a couple of guys I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to today with their head injuries
it is helping a lot of people take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: their heads and manage their head problems
so I'm glad you found it what I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know is are you sharing any information
with your fellow law enforcement friends
[SPEAKER_00]: it says that you are a former law
enforcement officer so if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are still in law enforcement
still active are you doing anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of educate them a little bit are you
doing it are are you sharing is your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use your THC use is this public
knowledge with anybody is your family
[SPEAKER_00]: knows your do your loved ones know do your
colleagues know I kind of want to know and
[SPEAKER_00]: if this is too much I won't share on the
podcast or anything send me an email let
[SPEAKER_00]: me know how are you using the THC to
control your PTSD is one thing I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: know not control but help and then how
public and or private are you about your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use and would you maybe share my
podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of your law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: friends or I don't know if you want to do
that because you don't want to out
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself but you've already you were no
longer a law enforcement officer so I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they're gonna fire you I'm just
trying dude maybe you can share this for
[SPEAKER_00]: us and spread the word with us and you're
on our team now so so help us out if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can I appreciate it it's always great to
hear people change and come to the green
[SPEAKER_00]: side from the dark side I just made that
up anyway I hope THC keeps your PTSD under
[SPEAKER_00]: control and I look forward to hearing more
from you thanks for the email ladies and
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen I'm sure I've said it a lot of
times if you want to email me it's grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com I would
love to hear from you I've got one more
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on a rant about just for a couple of
seconds before I start wrapping up the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast if there's something in your grow
room that you can do today do it today if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some cleaning up that could be
done if there's some improving that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: done some straightening if there's a small
mess that you need to wipe up if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do it today do it today don't push some
stuff off for tomorrow that can be done
[SPEAKER_00]: today because there's gonna be some other
shit tomorrow to handle one thing I teach
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys when I hire new people or when I
train people at a commercial grow I always
[SPEAKER_00]: teach them that the first thing you get to
do when you walk in is play a game called
[SPEAKER_00]: find the surprise commercial grows cost
millions of dollars but for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always a little fuck up it doesn't
seem to matter how much money you spend
[SPEAKER_00]: how much you prepare something goes wrong
randomly overnight when you're gone it
[SPEAKER_00]: always happens when you're gone if you
watch the cameras it always happens right
[SPEAKER_00]: when you leave you lock the door and then
click something goes fucking wrong and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't notice it until you get there 12
hours later you walk in at 7 or 8 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning and there's 50 gallons of water in
the floor or something weird happened that
[SPEAKER_00]: you never would have foreseen you never
could have predicted but now you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with it so always keep in mind that
there's gonna be shit popping up tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not prepared to deal with so
clean up do whatever you can today if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna defoliate defoliate today if
you could trellis trellis today don't wait
[SPEAKER_00]: until tomorrow because tomorrow is going
to have its own fucked up surprises knock
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out get it out of the way do what you
need to do early and then you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: kick back and relax if you let shit wait
until tomorrow that means you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna let something else wait until
tomorrow which means you got tomorrow's
[SPEAKER_00]: work plus that shit you waited for and
then you're not gonna get it all done so
[SPEAKER_00]: now that shit's gonna fall onto Wednesday
and now Wednesday is gonna fuck and suck
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got Monday's work fell onto
Tuesday Tuesday's work fell into Wednesday
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're doubled up on Wednesday now
instead of getting off at five you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get off till six and then fucking
Thursday already sucks so just do the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do get it done have it done and
then when Friday and Saturday come it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kicking at time you don't have to worry so
much that's my advice if you can get it
[SPEAKER_00]: done today get in there and get it done
today because tomorrow tomorrow you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm the I'm the manager the facility
manager that grow the cultivation manager
[SPEAKER_00]: the co-leader at my grow and if a
contractor shows up I have to follow them
[SPEAKER_00]: around and talk to them if the MED shows
up I'm the one that has to follow them
[SPEAKER_00]: around and talk to them when the
consultants come when the investors come
[SPEAKER_00]: when the owners come that's right I follow
them around and talk to them so if I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got some work planned for tomorrow and I
stacked up too much shit for myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: one ring of the doorbell happens my whole
day can be jumbled and I'm not gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to do what I want to do and if I
saved something from yesterday for today
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly not gonna have time to do it
alright I feel like I reiterated and
[SPEAKER_00]: reiterated that rambly point just get shit
done don't hesitate don't wait the plants
