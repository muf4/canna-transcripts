[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you noticed a brand new intro
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend just afar I sent that in several
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure to play it on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not you may hear some different
intro submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could happen around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure to get that on the
show because I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of amazed that it took so long
to find somebody submit an entry with a
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae air horn at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I exactly what I expected right what I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to just a far I for the
great intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget about thanks for nothing
for the regular intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear that on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to make sure to play just a far
eyes submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So support just a far I on cannabis,
give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks once again to my buddy just a
far I for the great intro track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you do know I like to start the
podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of hella
tight live batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of sex on the beach and
peach wrecker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as sour and
starfruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've talked about this on the
podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sweet funky fruitness going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another term that is almost
sour that I cannot quite describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says it contains 60.15% THC
and non detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to green dot labs for the
delicious hella tight live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, in this episode, I'm going to
talk about my breeding project I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, then I will get into some Patreon
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to talk about a
recent breeding project update.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following the show,
you know that I've been working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired some Jack the Ripper seeds out
of that package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find a very quality male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very pleased with his aroma,
his structure, his shape, his flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he started to flower, he smelled a
little bit like lime vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had too many margaritas and
threw up, that's almost what he sounded
[SPEAKER_00]: like, smelled like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like a disgusting
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disgusting flavors are beautiful when it
comes to breeding and selecting male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the margarita, lime,
sort of a key lime pie, vomit flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant with a beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pollinated really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a beautiful flower shape and
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used him to pollinate several other
females in that room where a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: other Jack the Ripper females,
number two and four were my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't decide which one was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So numbers two and four got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed quite randomly,
two and four, if I plant 10, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 seeds, numbers two and four,
and I don't number them and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: numbered before anything happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put 10 seeds down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll label them one, two, three,
four, five, two and four are always
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking killers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it works out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keepers, always champions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kept number two and four of the Jack
the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a platinum tangy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a golden goat female in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a blueberry cookies in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lemon skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a morning dew plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, the morning dew did
not make very many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right on the line of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got skeet skeeted on all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have made a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise also did not make it made some
but not a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a shit ton of seeds from the Jack
the Ripper females and the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of them did not make the
desired amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These weren't meant to be a production
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no profit to be made off of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will be testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will be sent out to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if they're worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow all these out, find out if we
made gems or if we made turds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something I feel is worth
contributing to the future of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we may release those seeds through
the vendors through other forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you get my seeds, you know where
to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting them now, you'll be able
to find those seeds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will be a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to run them and make sure they're
worth the crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to take your money until I've
tested these and make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: quality quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of my job as a breeder to
verify what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you some junk that
you're not going to be completely happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to set you up for success as much
as I set myself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I with the update?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even give you an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated all those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is I cut the plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them hang for several days until
they are crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put them in a like a storage
container like a Rubbermaid container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on some rubber gloves and while
they're over the container, I just grind
[SPEAKER_00]: them up with my hands like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mush mush mush mush mush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear the seeds fall out into
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull out all the big sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sticks go in the trash or the Bokashi
bin or the compost pile depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: we got going on at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got a easy seed seed sorting
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all that seed rolls to one end and
all the material is super dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run all of that through an easy seed
sorting machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pull all the chaff from the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one pile of seeds, one pile of
wasteful material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll go probably in a compost bin or in
a Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it goes right in the trash to be
quite honest with you, but try to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: wasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what I can with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will happen here hopefully over the
next few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been tied up with a couple other
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of good things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get caught up, we'll get those
seeds all sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: My update is that they're harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't as many seeds and some as I
hoped for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are way more seeds than I
anticipated in some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get them out to some testers and we
will get some reports back to you as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to germinate some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be ahead of the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want my testers flowering before
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get some germ time going,
some veg time going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm into flower, then I'll probably
send some out to some other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them run them, see what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the update on the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to ask, what happened to
the JTR?
[SPEAKER_00]: You quit talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit talking about it because every time
I mention it, I get a hundred emails
[SPEAKER_00]: asking if people can test those Jack the
Rippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys let me grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me play with them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get them packaged up, sorted,
cleaned up, all that good stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will offer some testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to be a tester, some criteria
I will look for is I want to see your
[SPEAKER_00]: social media photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you posting on social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of grow do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of photos do you take?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when I'm having people grow
testers, your photos become the photos
[SPEAKER_00]: that land on the website because I need a
good quality photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you guys find a better phenotype
than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you guys find gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get a really solid photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that shit, but I need someone
that can take good photos, that can take
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable notes, that can communicate well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that don't disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, I want to be a tester
and you send them seeds and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fucking a charitable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a set of free seeds out of me and
they never talked to me, contacted me
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there growing fire,
probably renamed it, made their own strain
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what could happen at that point,
but I need people that are cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: not dicks, people that I can rely on,
people that will communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good way to up your chances are to be
on Cannabuzz and or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a big bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to build a large community on
Cannabuzz because they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: boot me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram could boot me at any moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz, I know the owners and creators
of Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've contributed financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to say that I've
contributed financially to Cannabuzz as
[SPEAKER_00]: well being.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to operate because I helped
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join Cannabuzz, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then also, um, if you're on Patreon,
that does also help you out, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a tester, uh, just to show that
you're on the team and you're supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that way I've got a way to
communicate with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on Patreon, that means you're
for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, uh, they'll get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they never talked to me
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurts my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got limited seeds and now you're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon people are supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're part of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind sending you guys some rare
gems that I know will benefit both the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys so much for watching.
I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that this person who did not sign
their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they want me to call
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this listener who says, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they want books.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want guidance on books to read before
they get all of their stuff before they
[SPEAKER_00]: find a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect that and appreciate this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you guys be more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you listening probably are,
but there are so many people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of need to check out a social media
because I see so many terrible questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and there aren't bad questions,
just things you should have read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like day one shit and you're on day like
37 and you already have a problem you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of the books that I will
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will recommend any books by an author
named Greg Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Green is an amazing cannabis author.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also everything by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Connell Clark will go deep into a
cannabis and cultivation education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to read these books a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read a chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read that chapter again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read another chapter, go back and read
them both again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in a hurry to read these books.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this knowledge in your brain,
learn it, have a good foundation,
[SPEAKER_00]: then move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're reading some stuff may not
make sense, but a couple of chapters
[SPEAKER_00]: later, you're going to go, Oh wait,
I just saw the magic trick and it all will
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of unveil itself and it will make
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So read the Robert Connell Clark books.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a lot to read, but you're going
to learn so much from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also recommend Jorge Cervantes
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to go, Oh, we said Jorge
Jorge is an older grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what he says will be,
uh, timely, uh, no outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the word that I'm avoiding,
but a lot of his technology is old.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost a lot of money to grow
with Jorge Cervantes methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot of science and
technology to run his methods and this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a good resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes is a very, very good place
to start when it comes with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another guy that is very popular in
the authoring space when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are going to turn their noses
up to the fact that I said Ed Rosenthal
[SPEAKER_00]: because again, his stuff is a little
outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from back in the day, but he has got
a very solid foundation for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read a Jorge book or an Ed book
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last books were kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me put them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying those guys are a little
bit older.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, they may not be up with all
the modern shit, but the stuff they put
[SPEAKER_00]: out will never stop being relevant and
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good quality info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read everything they've said,
but I'll support most of what those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: say and it will still be useful in 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys are great books,
great authors to read books from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Greg Green, Robert Connell
Clark, Clark with an E Robert Connell
[SPEAKER_00]: Clark, C L A R K E.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the book,
marijuana botany is an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes is books.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders, the grow Bible, uh,
Ed Rosenthal, Ed Rosenthal put out an
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakster dam course guide, the book for
Oakster dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is quite useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good resource for all growers
on all levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another book I would recommend is,
uh, from Drew West secrets of the West
[SPEAKER_00]: coast masters by Drew West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, kind of a secretive book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people knew about that as a
good book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a breeder by the name of Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma is from ice from Jacksonville,
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get my facts right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually Soma ended up in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma is a very well-known breeder,
well-known grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been part of the cannabis industry
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big part of all the high times,
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma has written a book that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start reading about Soma and you
know who Soma is, you'll see my connection
[SPEAKER_00]: to Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a dreadlocked white guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's into the same sort of vibes as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, another book that you might want to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I forgot one, another author.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a book from is DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ short put out a small book,
uh, him and Soma both put out very small,
[SPEAKER_00]: very short grow books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they didn't put all the details in
there that Jorge and Ed put in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they put their little tricks and these
little tricks that each grower develops
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way is how a grower will develop
their own style, their own niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you think about bands,
they're all playing drums, bass guitar,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some keyboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all doing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all counting to four playing
chords, but just the little things that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've picked up along the way or what
makes a band different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're from, what they did,
what they saw that's going to affect you
[SPEAKER_00]: as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the book by Soma and DJ
short are very niche books by growers with
[SPEAKER_00]: very established reputations, uh,
very established spots in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need to make a big,
thick book, just their thick book with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of very cool tricks in it will
suffice from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Soma and DJ short are the next two
I'll recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a guy known as the rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rev has written a lot of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, check out the books by the rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rev, I should check my
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure the rev wrote,
uh, teaming with microbes and true living
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that that's
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: True living, not loving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a totally different book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that we get the
right author on this, but that's another
[SPEAKER_00]: book that you need either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: True living organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could buy it on Amazon, but it doesn't
tell me who it's by yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to keep clicking guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by the rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the true living organics book by the
rev is a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a teaming with microbes,
teaming with nutrients and teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing series, uh, that I really
think are great books as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check this, those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, another, um, author that I would be
failing you and myself, if I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: mention was Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out books by Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank writes great cannabis books and
does great cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody else I should mention,
uh, there's a book called three alight,
[SPEAKER_00]: three alight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll teach you a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of crazy shit, but if you
grow three pounds of light, I think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, I think let's grow a pound
is the last book I'm going to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called let's grow a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't want to grow a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are several books that I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then we can mention a few more other
things that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing more notes as we go because
I'm having more ideas as this goes along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those are several books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention the authors again to recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert O'Connell Clark, Jorge Cervantes,
Ed Rosenthal, Drew West, Soma,
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short, The Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the only authors I wrote
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are plenty for you to research
and find resources from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those are available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of them are available for free
as PDFs on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type in PDF, uh, Jorge Cervantes,
Grow Bible, it will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: PDF, Ed, Ed Rosenthal, uh, what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakster Dam Course Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Soma, Grow Book, PDF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I recommend, and you're
listening to my show, so you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can't read a book while you're
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can, but, uh, I've seen terrible
shit happen from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't read a book while you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't read a book while you're in the
cubicle at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't undercover read a book with an
earbud in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to podcasts all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some of that info will just stick
in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even realize it's sticking and
you didn't have to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great cannabis podcasts
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, of course this show, listen to this
show and tell your friends about this
[SPEAKER_00]: show, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, check out the Embracing
Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a show called Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about organic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my buddy Dirtman Dan and Stabby and
Tenasi and Fumidor and several other
[SPEAKER_00]: kick-ass dudes go on Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is live every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's at 7 PM mountain time,
but it stays up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go watch all the old episodes
on Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about random chaotic shit as
well, but we will teach you a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, I do a Monday live show on
Instagram every Monday around seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a live show where I talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer random cannabis questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may learn a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend the do dude grows
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DGC, the dude grows crew, the dude
grows show is a, a great, it's an endless
[SPEAKER_00]: resource for cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've got a team of six people doing
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a research guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a cool, the whole crew chimes
in the, the dude grows crew, the people
[SPEAKER_00]: watching the audience join the forum and
give advice to the grow questions and help
[SPEAKER_00]: people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you're watching my show,
you can find the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend cannabis cultivating
information and sciences with Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad Hussey does an amazing cannabis
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out the grow cast and also
check out the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I know podcasting sometimes you may
not want to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't learn that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another good show out there
by a guy named Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman speaks very clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of great cannabis knowledge
and he's got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Danny Danko may have re
sparked the old free weed podcast with a
[SPEAKER_00]: new name, I would have to look and find
the new name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is I know it's in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't think of the name of it right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remembered it until we got here and it
was time to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to scroll through it's
called grow bud yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's Danny Danko's new
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out grow bud yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure that that's Danny
Danko show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't say it's got to be Danny Danko in
there just by the names that I'm seeing on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to claim that's Danny
Danko.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a corrections department
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's another guy who I would be
rude if I didn't mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this guy is a you guys think
I'm some sort of cannabis Yoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my ganja Yoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to a man by the name of Kevin
Jodri.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spells his name J-O-D-R-E-Y Kevin
Jodri.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's part of the regenerative regenerative
that was excuse me, the regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of talking about cannabis
and breeding and sustainability and
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you want to know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Jodri has probably spoken about it
or he will very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Jodri is fucking cannabis Yoda in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out Kevin Jodri.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn a lot from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there are more resources I
could give you, but I've been rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: about that one and I forgot the other ones
that were on the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out all of those
resources and I'm hoping you learn a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm proud of you for wanting to
read more books.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dive in head first and smash their
head on a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of more messages and I
don't want to run out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next message comes from Jare Bear and
it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, we are building
out our grow still and it's coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you great success in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly but surely that is how it goes
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contractors take their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you tell them to hurry,
the longer they're going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the inspectors are going to
take even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then licensing is going to take even
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this that we don't need
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to the point of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey man, I've been digging the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to keep in touch because I like
your suggestions, your selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the show and the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving learning more about your
genetics and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to appreciate all of the work
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the constant feed of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting all the stuff I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my wife has even come to like your
show minus all the cussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the minor cussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I'm myself on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I thought about making a cuss jar
or a swear jar, I did make a contribution
[SPEAKER_00]: to somebody every time for a certain
amount of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If every time I said a cuss word,
I had to put a $5 bill in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back to saying,
fuck it and being myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sometimes a fuck is the best word
for the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that some people don't like
that, but it's better to be me than try to
[SPEAKER_00]: censor myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry to your wife for all the
profanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know sometimes the ladies aren't way
into that, but I'm glad she's come around
[SPEAKER_00]: and she enjoys the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I do use some chorus language,
I'm a pretty good dude most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep my grower friend, keep Jerry bear
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the good wives,
keeping us good men strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take good care of this dude here for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could use it for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better use it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what keeps you motivated every
day in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep the positive vibe going?
[SPEAKER_00]: What seems like every day from your
friend, Jerry bear and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jerry bear and miss Jerry bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful question because I do
work every day in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in a warehouse, which hasn't
been as much lately, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The COVID stuff slowed down all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had to go out of town to go to a
commercial grow and suit up and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: weird grow gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been kind of nice taking a
little break doing that, but I am in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealing with either a podcast,
my own grow, a seed sale, a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project, a deal somewhere, a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do phone conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phone consultations all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do work in the industry every single
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any industry that you're in, I was in the
music industry and when I quit the music
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, I was like, Oh, that was a bunch
of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad that's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything you do is going to be
stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have some sort of a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about how you see that challenge,
how you accept that challenge,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you embrace that challenge,
how you take that struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I stay motivated every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be, I don't want to disrespect
anybody else's job, but I don't want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be flipping burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be working in IT.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be in the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would fucking not work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all you guys that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that's not for me and I'm
blessed and grateful and I acknowledge the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that I'm not doing those things that
I'm doing what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to my friends on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to people and help them
improve their gardens and their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do consultations and make big
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were making a little bit of profit,
make a lot of profit so they can give
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the center a bonus and the
patients can get a better quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing what I want to do every day all
day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spoiled and part of that keeps me
motivated knowing that if I don't do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be doing that and I don't want to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, no offense to you guys doing
your thing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand some people are fucking
struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I am blessed and I
acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I've got a very good thing
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part keeps me motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this knowledge by studying,
reading, learning, absorbing, practicing,
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in JA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if I didn't use this
knowledge, also not only the gift of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning cannabis very well, I've got this
gift of speaking and providing
[SPEAKER_00]: information, relaying information in a
really clear and concise way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't utilize both of those,
it would be disrespectful to you and to JA
[SPEAKER_00]: to not put this gift back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm given a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my return contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things I do,
but this is one of my give backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like my karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without this, I would blow up if I
didn't do this show, if I didn't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, if I didn't play the drums once
or twice a week, I would, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's spontaneously combust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'd be an explosion and
eruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things wouldn't be well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this podcast is what it's a lot of my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry is a lot of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing people, seeing plants that look
yellow and shitty turn into a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest is part of what keeps me
motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning shit around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote notes and I haven't even needed to
use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: New questions keep me motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day there's a new question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day there's a new challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also every day there's new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling somebody, the other day,
I haven't been in a commercial grow in so
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been basically a little bit into
quarantine, but I was like, I haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial grow that I feel like it's
all changed because it changes so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every other day we're like,
Oh, have you seen this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should put one of these in the grow,
put this in room B and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or let's put this in the small room and
see if it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking at new toys,
new gear, and then we buy it and we put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and we take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We document that shit, watch it on camera,
watch it on the monitor units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like all the technology has
surpassed me in the past three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's out there anymore,
but I'm paying attention by contacting and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watch online.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you guys love to post your fucking
grows online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see what's going on in every grow
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really good eye for detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are always new questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always new technology and there
are always new states legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting a whole new audience and
batch of people that need help all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new growers that are calling me
up, emailing me, finding the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: sending me Twitter messages, reaching out
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constant influx of new people that need
help and all that motivation from new
[SPEAKER_00]: people keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to help 30 people a day,
fix their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that were going to have a failure
get to have a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, just seeing that
improvement, seeing a rescue just feels
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's motivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new struggles every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always new struggles in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I've learned everything
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like, it's like when you go
into, I use karate as an analogy a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into an MMA fight, both of you
are trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to expect, but there's going
to be a couple of moments in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the fuck is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get to figure it out on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm comfortable fucking swinging,
kicking, blocking, taking you down,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that choke hold on, defending
another choke hold, wrapping around,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that Kimura going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you start to throw on that rear
naked choke, I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could shake out, shake out of that rear
naked choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could fucking get back up on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get the fucking mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could ground and pound at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you throw some weird questions at
me, it's not hard anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm doing, but I like the
challenge of answering the question kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I do that Monday live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps me sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no editing, no censoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to answer every question that comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what's nine times nine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what's A plus B?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like B plus A bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to answer them as quick as I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those challenges keep me motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember who said it now,
but I got so many quotes in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm forgetting the author.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Einstein or Edison that said,
I don't think I'm a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just passionately curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking Einstein, who said that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Passionately curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know everything about this plant
inside and out so that I can make you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: able to grow this plant beautifully and
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't understand completely,
I can't teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rewards are a lot of what keeps me
motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's a financial reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get Patreon contributions for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sponsors pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a paycheck for doing consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get paid for selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on top of that, the inbox messages
that say, hey, Ross and Jeff, my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you spent five minutes on a podcast
saying do this, do this and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now my plants look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is equally as rewarding as a PayPal
financial contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop with the PayPal and don't stop
with the compliments either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they feel equally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both like a big high five,
a pat on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people saying, I've got cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you taught me how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot that I have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, think about how that would make you
feel inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to get filled up with that
positive energy from those sort of stories
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get to see it in real life,
not just through messages, I get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of what keeps me
motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big part of what keeps me
motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangible outcomes keep me motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're accomplishing goals,
you want to get more goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can do two things in a day,
you want to do three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get three, you want to
do five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something about doing five
that makes you want to do 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do 10, you don't want 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you got 20, you want 25 or 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get 30, you want 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 50 makes you want 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just saying financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying crushing goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying collecting anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get that snowball going,
it's exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like accomplishing goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much I can get done in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So answering those many questions,
seeing the tangible progress, that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps me motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message,
Jerbear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about all the stuttering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give your wife a big shout out
for coming around to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize for my filthy mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to behave myself, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the last email for the show
because I've been going for a lot longer
[SPEAKER_00]: on these emails than I anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all for love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all for the support of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that in the, Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, I just want to thank you for
such a great podcast material at the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saying the show ain't worth nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they just said, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught the joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like contributing,
you can patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so can over fertilization cause a
plant to herm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the quick answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, do you stress test your strains
to their herming point?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can plants herm from over fertilization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like OG Kush and some chems will
absolutely herm by looking at them wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breathe at it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wear the wrong shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your shoes in your shirt don't match,
sometimes OG Kush will get mad at you and
[SPEAKER_00]: herm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a thing that Kush genetics do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overfeed, underfeed, the wrong
temperatures, major temperature swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: weird stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things can cause hermaphroditic
traits in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over fertilization can absolutely cause a
plant to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going, I've been fed so hard that I
just don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a plant freaks out, it
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to become asexual,
pollinate itself so that it can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's going to die a slow,
miserable death, at least it gets to make
[SPEAKER_00]: babies and they get to live and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, over fertilization can absolutely
cause your plant to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part is, if so, do you test
your strains to their herming point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of stress tests will
cause my plants to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite stress test is a light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the lights on for 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now in flower for 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I'll fuck that light cycle up
and put it on 18-6, then put it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll watch and see if the plants do any
weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't, they get to keep living.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do weird shit, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut them all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put them on 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put them back on 12-12 and we'll
keep watching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't herm out from that,
I don't think they're going to herm out
[SPEAKER_00]: from over fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how my plants are auditioned
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those plants are pollinated,
I send my seeds to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that many of those people are over
feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not calling anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've selected people that are amazing
growers and scary growers and everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my plants are getting grown by
fucking champions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know that the seeds I made are
getting fucking abused, like fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hostages in a fucking cage somewhere,
but that's what I need to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rely on those abusive growers to tell me
that these plants are herms or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones going to find the
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they don't find herms, they don't
find problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the plants are good for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't over fertilize for stress testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do more of a light test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do more weird shit like that,
but the growers, my testers, I am certain
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are over fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen some crazy shit in test
reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones doing that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, also, since I have
learned to clone, seeds seem amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my favorite statement on today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay a good dollar amount for a package
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have been paying good dollar
amounts for some seeds on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: some auctions, and those are rare gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about having a rare gem at a
high cost, nobody else has got that
[SPEAKER_00]: package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you take clones of it, you've got
that plant forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep the clone going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to have that genetic,
that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reproduce that outcome over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your patience or your clientele or your
bong will always have that supply of that
[SPEAKER_00]: same medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something amazing, if it came from
seed and nobody else has it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from a seed and you don't give a
clone out, nobody else has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've set yourself apart from the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of those guys that needs
market competition, nobody else has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, I've got the only strawberry
starburst around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the phenotype that turns purple and
smells like watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the only one with it, what they
want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who's coming to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that wants that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are amazingly cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you learn how to clone, you can keep
that seed around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of runs, it will pay for those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the first run pays for the seeds
on itself, covers the cost of gear and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second one is all for the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the news goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you pop up in the feed a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically food will cause it to
hermaphrodite, temps and stress and light
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't leave your name, so I can't say
thank you, but that's how the news goes.
