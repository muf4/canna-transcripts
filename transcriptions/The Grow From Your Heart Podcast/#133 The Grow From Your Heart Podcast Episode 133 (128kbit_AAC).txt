[SPEAKER_06]: You know I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: While that music was loud, holy shit,
that's why it sounds all echoey in my
[SPEAKER_06]: head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if it's echoing in your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the

new banger, got a dope new dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to all my friends over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you support Elevate Glass in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting across from me, you guys,
is the lovely, the traveling stoner,
[SPEAKER_06]: my friend, Ms. Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing today, honey?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I introduced you right as you were
about to take a drink, but it was the
[SPEAKER_06]: rhythm.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was feeling the flow.
You're all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting to my left here is our good
friend, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hanging out, taking some dabs,
doing a podcast, loving life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious, delicious hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to get the echo out of this show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I just fixed the echo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about the echo there, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I realized it was happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just could not figure out where it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where it was coming from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Echo has been solved.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we talk about first?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm proud to announce that this
podcast is now available on Tokeradio.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the show airs on Wednesdays at 1 p
.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokeradio.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Jay, Citizen Jay at
Tokeradio.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should verify what time that airs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm mostly sure that's Wednesdays at 1 p
.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll verify that by the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you guys are talking, I will check an
email that I got from Jay and we will make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that I'm telling you the right time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we shout out to Elevate?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure we did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, what a secret sash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret sash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a secret if we talk about it here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we just can't talk about the
location, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a secret sash.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like you to join us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay will be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, you're going to come to the secret
sash, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: White Mike might make an appearance.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't make it to a lot of cannabis
events because he is busy at city council
[SPEAKER_06]: fighting for the rights of Pueblo
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or lately, I'm just home with the kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of podcast listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to deal with this one
for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's the kid, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had another checkup today and all
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two seconds about the kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys could deal with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love for the kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's the wife, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything good at home?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the car running good?
[SPEAKER_06]: This just got fucking weird real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret Sash, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: May 19th.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope you will be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret Sash, underscore CO on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the information on how to get
tickets, how to get VIP tickets,
[SPEAKER_06]: regular tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come party with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come glob out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best shacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best powder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best live resins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best wax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best THC distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not some of the best people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did meet one dude there that I wish I
would have never met.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always one at every party.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made it at that party.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of cannabis events in
Colorado and I don't want to go to a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of them, but this one's high on my list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one was really sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hang out with you all night,
actually, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was... It worked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can retell the story that you told
Mike about the dab I took.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Mary's motivation on
Instagram, Brent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to meet him at a secret session.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had some of this THC distillate and
Jeff is a wook and always takes such big
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs and he took a nice chunk glob of this
THC distillate and you just watched his
[SPEAKER_03]: whole face change and that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was super stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff was still dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff was still smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not going to look like a wimp,
but you could just see all over his face
[SPEAKER_03]: that that dab changed his level for the
whole night and that was it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of remember that dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember being like, yeah, give me a
fatty glob, dude, because I love some
[SPEAKER_06]: distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pull the fattest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should kind of try to describe what
distillate is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they take CO2, they...
[SPEAKER_06]: A hash maker will take CO2 hash,
hash that's made with CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes it's kind of black and goopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it comes out kind of gold,
but then they do what I think is fractal
[SPEAKER_06]: distillation is what I think it's called
and it could be done with steam.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be done... I'm not sure how a lot
of the companies do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the companies have their own
proprietary method, but they pretty much
[SPEAKER_06]: distill this product and they give you
pure THC with terpenes put back in or some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the companies actually put in terpenes
that are purchased from other products
[SPEAKER_06]: that are derived from other products.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what this guy had was just pure
cannabis with cannabis terpenes in it,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's all pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just super pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's THC and terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can take the biggest freaking dabs
and you don't choke.
[SPEAKER_06]: My lungs felt like they got a little smoke
in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh yeah, my lungs got some
smoke and I blew it out and there was a
[SPEAKER_06]: cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, yeah, I'm not going to
cough, but I could definitely feel...
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you could feel the face go a
little... Bounce from white to red to
[SPEAKER_05]: white to red.
[SPEAKER_05]: The usual Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that raw THC distillate was just out
of this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, he gifted Chris and I that and
the added terpenes one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chris can't remember which terpene was
added to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a good week.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really good week.
[SPEAKER_06]: This morning dab was special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike brought over some strawberry banana
dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to dab that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds super interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, some live resin I picked up the other
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that from the Place of Employment?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I picked that up at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Botanico product though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Botanico.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they make some tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the new Terpex packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love their new packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secret Sash May 19th.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we've finished that part
up, but I take dabs at Secret Sash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you come take dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about a couple of
things here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike and I and Lindsay, Mike and I have
lived here for a long ass time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen this cannabis industry change.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought all the raids and all the
cannabis shit has gone away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay's been here for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: She hasn't seen any cannabis trouble in
the time that she's been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in the past, how many weeks,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many raids?
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 now.
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 raids in seven weeks in Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not like stores or licensed
facilities or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're private grows that are way over
their legal plant count.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way over their legal plant count.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw them pulling a whole bunch of plants
out of one guy's garage on the news the
[SPEAKER_06]: other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number 18 only have like 50 plants,
but a couple of them before that were in
[SPEAKER_05]: the several hundred or like 1200,
1500.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read somewhere that a lot of these grows
are connected.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another set of raids up in
Springs that this 18 doesn't count,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we're all connected in like El Paso
and Denver County.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our laws didn't change the black market
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's still a bunch of black
market growers that are sitting around all
[SPEAKER_05]: winter going, where's the place where I
think I can hide?
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one will notice me growing
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently like if you're sitting in
Florida all winter thinking that the
[SPEAKER_05]: answer is Colorado, cause there's a shit
load of people from Florida getting busted
[SPEAKER_05]: growing a shit load of plants here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the raids happen to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they happen to be people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where are you from over there,
Ms. Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms. The traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in Jersey, so I guess I'll
claim that today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ever claim that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I never tell people I'm from Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will claim Florida over Jersey any day,
but not in this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made a couple of friends that are
recent arrivals in Colorado, like over the
[SPEAKER_05]: last year and a half or so from Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've told all of them like,
yo, if you're growing weed, make sure your
[SPEAKER_05]: plant count is spot the fuck on because
it's only a matter of time before a
[SPEAKER_05]: sheriff knocks on your door and is like,
I hear you're from Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I see your basement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see your basement?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it that easy for me to knock?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a couple of things that work
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all the bus are in the same area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you ask me, because all the press
stories all say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: A citizen complaint was called in.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sheriffs went out to check,
confirmed the suspicion that there was
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana being grown there, checked the
plant counts, found a shit load of plants
[SPEAKER_05]: and no paperwork and arrested the recent
arrival from Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's like 18 grows and like 15 of
them match that exact layout.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think it's the anti-pop people
that have that, that are working on that
[SPEAKER_05]: ballot initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them live out in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're just driving around
looking at new house or looking at houses
[SPEAKER_05]: for vents and the stink of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just calling on everything
they find.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not reporting on all of the grows
that are perfectly legal where they knock
[SPEAKER_05]: on the door and the dude's like,
I totally grow marijuana here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hundred percent legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have blank number of plants and X number
of paperwork sheets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's everything to confirm what I'm
legally allowed to have come take a look.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I've got.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can confirm it's all correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just turn around and leave.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a small grow isn't a big deal right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, having a legal grow isn't an issue at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not messing with the businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that happens in a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the home grows that are way out
of compliance with our law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they're using electricity
bills to find?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say they're looking at that
and they have a lot of angles,
[SPEAKER_03]: but at the end of the day, what it comes
down to is that if you come out here,
[SPEAKER_03]: please do it legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have listened to so many podcasts of you
to sit here and say, do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop, you know, stop trying to,
you're making our community look bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making us look like we are trying
to break the laws and trying to get away
[SPEAKER_03]: with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us in the community are trying to,
I have not started growing yet since I
[SPEAKER_03]: have come out here because my paperwork is
not in order yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to be growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to have a whole, you know,
two rooms going, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I need to get my paperwork in line
first and I can grow six legally as a
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado resident.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't be a hypocrite.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there was a time where I was moving
and shaking and doing shit that should not
[SPEAKER_06]: be spoken of on a podcast, but we've told
some hypothetical stories of my past.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're, if you are hustling on the
black market, doing your thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not a hater.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to do your thing, do what you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But eventually there's going to come a
time when you, when you got to start
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking about shifting to the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a difference between making money.
[SPEAKER_03]: To survive and being greedy and having
these huge grows that these people are
[SPEAKER_03]: getting busted for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's these huge commercial grows in
houses for no reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're all going to go and sell that
in another, you know, like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you really think about it, it's just so
stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is why they were in the national
parks 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they hide anywhere they think they
can hide.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, and they're trying to hide in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, they don't realize how well
publicized the rules have been here
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're not publicized anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like New Mexico, Florida, Kansas,
none of these places care about what the
[SPEAKER_05]: zoning rules are for the shops or what the
home grill rules are in each city and
[SPEAKER_05]: county.
[SPEAKER_05]: So none of that shit makes the paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says weeds legal and they're
allowed to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: How strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they think, Oh, I can move to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can throw down the 18 grand or whatever
I've managed to save up on grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rent a house, um, pull a crop or two,
drive it all back to Florida and bam,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got 400 grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just don't see how insane that
plan is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like the grow store is going to sell
you all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the, when you plug it all in,
you're going to have to have the power
[SPEAKER_05]: company come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time the power company is done
upgrading you, all your neighbors want to
[SPEAKER_05]: know what the fuck you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as it smells like weed,
which is going to be about, what,
[SPEAKER_05]: eight weeks later?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, one of them is going to call the
sheriff and go, would you knock on this
[SPEAKER_05]: buck store?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had some guy building some shit there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did new electricity, watched him
carrying a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it reeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure he's got an illegal
operation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all assuming you don't have a
landlord that's going to be checking on
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and all of that jazz as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of these guys were like,
just showed up right at a house and went
[SPEAKER_05]: to bought some plywood and started ply
boarding over exterior windows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like one dude had a pit bull chain to
a window well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like these are idiots in the most extreme
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, because I mean, if you think about it,
you could move here, grow even your six
[SPEAKER_05]: plant, just being here as an adult limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you were dumb enough to take the
risk to move that back to Florida,
[SPEAKER_05]: just that smaller harvest, you could still
make a fair living.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it wouldn't be extravagant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't be rolling back and forth in
a brand new Escalade, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could make enough to pay your rent and
pay your bills, but they're trying to do
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of plants because they're stupid
and greedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they think no one's going to notice
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, that's just so insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you do get it harvested and dried
and cured, you're going to get pulled the
[SPEAKER_06]: fuck over.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as you cross into Kansas,
a couple of them got busted halfway to
[SPEAKER_05]: where they were headed because they just,
the turn signal violation, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds of weed in the car smells like
hundreds of pounds of weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, y'all know how bad your quarter ounce
stinks on the way home from picking it up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like magnify that by a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you guys aren't being smart
and vacuum sealing it and like doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just putting it in trash bags and
throwing it in the back and praying to God
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll make it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trash bags is the gangster way to carry
somebody though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you know that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to get two of the hefties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just double bag that shit home.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember my little, my little friend
that's not real tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to give me the trash bag,
the clear trash bags full.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, that hypothetically
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that allegedly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were good days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: The days of coming up and growing big
ridiculous amounts of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado, maybe come into an end here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still possible if you're gung ho,
you got to be smart about it, but be
[SPEAKER_06]: careful you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to come here from another
state and think you're going to set up
[SPEAKER_06]: shop, read the rules, get, get really
familiar with the rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: The two parts of this that pissed me off
the most was like, a, now we got to pay to
[SPEAKER_05]: send these fucks to jail and b,
they're fucking up our reputation and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're giving a whole bunch of fire to
the anti-pop people and they didn't need
[SPEAKER_05]: to fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, uh, they've lost two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time they spoke up, they got told
fuck off and, uh, they're really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really angry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need fuel for that fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 18 busts in seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like and every single one of them is out
in Pueblo West basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I mean, you've lived here for how
long?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pueblo doesn't report shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it all of a sudden we've got 18
successful pot grow tips in seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's some weird shit going on
right now and people didn't see it coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're growing in Pueblo,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your shit cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your plan count in order.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Colorado wide right now,
like gearing up for the election.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a new president coming in
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing everywhere, if you're
growing, get your shit cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now's a good time to think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you, if you're a medical marijuana
grower, uh, if you've got a plant count,
[SPEAKER_06]: go count your fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go consider like, go get one under your
plant count.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that if some shit goes wrong and you
break off a branch and it looks like an
[SPEAKER_06]: extra plan on accident, uh, go check your
gram weight, uh, get to your perfect gram
[SPEAKER_06]: weight and then roll up a fat joint and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're a fat joint underneath your gram
limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just go get your shit in order.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike looked at me like that's,
that's no, that's a really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had that thought the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I've got a nice hash pile going
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, Hmm, like I can't even
take this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I moved technically I'll have to
break the law moving this from house one
[SPEAKER_05]: to house two, because I'm not supposed to
have that much shit out in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm over my gram limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, how much?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you've got to, can we talk about
your extended plant count and your medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana card?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we talk about that on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but just theoretically just for the
illegal rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause at the same time I was thinking
about needing to go get my card again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of this applies to us too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're not special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we've got deadlines to reapply and
dates to follow and card cats to adhere
[SPEAKER_05]: to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I get my doctor and my MMJ doctor a
shout out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I get to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he, dude, he would do fucking line is
long enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike just made a really good, it takes
like four weeks to get into the fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to go May 19th to go renew my
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you give me his number?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just really wanted to make them all feel
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few blocks from the office.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind giving it to one or two
people, but don't shout it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I was just trying to prove a
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Bruce needs some business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the same one up here down there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you, you catch him on his Springs day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in Springs like four days a week now
and he's in Pueblo one day a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to my MMJ doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows, he knows my conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows me well.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I walk in, he just starts writing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this like the 10th time?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, yep, 10 years in a row,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a medical marijuana patient for
probably close to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say Mike's thinking back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's got a better, I have a seven or
eight for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've got a decade yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys go and get them together for
the first time around similar time?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the same same year within a year or
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had one before me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was running a shop and that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He came in as a patient with one with
another patient and we got along.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got along pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was love at first sight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was love at first sight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: That place was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're reminiscing all chatterbox.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: People like hearing insight to our lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do because like guys like Seb,
shout out to Ross De Seb.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get to sit around and be on a
podcast and take dabs and live the life
[SPEAKER_06]: that we get to live.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got to fucking dodge ostriches.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that fucking thing Seb almost
ran over?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it an emu?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever that thing was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seb, what was that thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy Seb posted a video.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was driving in Australia and a giant
long legged bird.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like an ostrich.
[SPEAKER_03]: An emu?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it could have been.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought I guessed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it could have been an emu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if you're not working the video
camera while you're driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like giant running birds would be easier
to dodge.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's got a dash cam of some sort
going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's periscoping, Snapchatting
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't judge the dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He lives in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just messing with Seb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually Seb, you're in Australia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is trying to kill you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the floor down and pay the fuck
attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything in Australia wants to kill you
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I said that, I was like,
I wonder if it's kind of like Russia where
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone has a camera mounted on their
dashboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And an M16?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it could be for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there, it's because the odds that
someone gets out and mugs you is really
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_06]: They use AKs over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my high.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it when they ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, I want to give a big shout out
to my friends over at Elevate Glacier.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the lovely ladies and the one
gentleman that run the place over at
[SPEAKER_06]: Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also my good friends at Hemp Higher
Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys check out the showroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you tell them Rasta Jeff sent
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a brand new recycler rig here
with the brand new banger on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I filled it just to the perfect level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can, you can really pull so hard
and you don't get water in your face and
[SPEAKER_06]: you get a big fat globby dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Mike, you were talking about some
political stuff is why we've got you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's just the one thing I wanted to
throw in right now is a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_05]: focused on the November election as they
should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay for paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I listened to a podcast the other
night where he was like really mean to the
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners and you were like, damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's primary elections too in
everybody's area and these matter and no
[SPEAKER_05]: one ever turns out for these.
[SPEAKER_05]: The example down here is this November,
we might be voting to ban the recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, before we even get to that vote
possibly happening, there'll be an
[SPEAKER_05]: election, a primary election.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Space the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: A primary election down here will reelect
people like city councilman and county
[SPEAKER_05]: commissioners and the local judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe there'll be a couple of small
local issues they get handled like city or
[SPEAKER_05]: countywide.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to run for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing this round.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if two people down here happen to get
elected instead of the two people that
[SPEAKER_05]: currently have this job getting reelected,
retail marijuana could go away anyway,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the number of pro and anti
marijuana votes would swing that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: With just two people getting swapped out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot going on politically in
everyone's area that they need to be
[SPEAKER_05]: paying attention to right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now is the time to go find out
if you're registered to vote, go find out
[SPEAKER_05]: how that works in your area.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just mail it to your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to do anything but check
the mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it shows up, you fill it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take it to a drop off point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the sticker that says I voted and
you get to be awesome for like the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other places, it's a little harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to go stand in line.
[SPEAKER_05]: But do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now is the time to figure out how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not till November.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's a long time away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of you are like, I just
planted my outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like after harvest, I'll figure out how to
run it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not fuck off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, that's what a lot of people
think right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the election's not till November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why pay attention?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying I'm not telling them to
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling that I'm thinking they don't
want to pay attention to politics yet
[SPEAKER_05]: because that shit's months and months
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now's the time to get registered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's the time to start paying attention
to what's going on in your area and start
[SPEAKER_05]: making sure you've done what you need to
do to actually vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sick of the marijuana community just
being a non-existent entity politically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we outnumber Christians.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about the number of Christians that
annoy you constantly because they're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: shit politically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about how powerful that particular
group of people is in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: We outnumber NRA members by five times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the DEA's estimate for how
many people smoke pot in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are more pot smokers than gun
toters?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't matter at all politically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't show up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got no hatred for anybody with a gun.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I said that condescendingly,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect anybody that carries a firearm.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about how much influence the NRA
wields.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you look up the actual number of
NRA members and their actual operating
[SPEAKER_05]: budget.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terrifying how a group that small can
be that influential.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were just to get a little bit
organized, or at least just all show up on
[SPEAKER_05]: election day, we could have a serious
authority coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those of us that do show up don't show
up unified even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'm pushing your listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start voting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we all will take a party bus anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put a dab rig on a bus and a bong
on a bus, put some Rasta Man with
[SPEAKER_06]: dreadlocks and some reggae music,
Rasta Man driving it, reggae music playing
[SPEAKER_06]: real loud and you paint a red golden
green.
[SPEAKER_06]: People get on there and smoke some fucking
hash and smoke some joints and have a good
[SPEAKER_06]: ass social time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get one of those and pick up stoners
and drive them to polling places to get
[SPEAKER_06]: them to vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an unheard of idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping a couple of the industry
players do something similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody that doesn't work a lot and have
a podcast and drive too much already,
[SPEAKER_06]: help me out with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put together some buses to go pick up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this possible?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I just too high?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this real?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you get a bus and drive people to
polling places?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that somewhere like Denver that
would totally fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think something like Pueblo that might
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get away with driving them,
smoking them out while you drive them
[SPEAKER_05]: requires a lot of extra insurance and a
much, much larger vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But every election there's groups that
grab vans and go bus seniors and other
[SPEAKER_05]: people that love to vote and have trouble
sometimes getting to the polling station
[SPEAKER_05]: and taking the seniors, but often vote the
whatever way they want them to vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll go round up those people and take
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Free joint if you vote.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't give stuff away.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of little rules like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just giving them a ride that's helping
someone perform their civic duty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see someone get legal trouble
for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be an awesome court case.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, get involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start Googling after the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do it right now while you
listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're at work in your cubicle,
the boss isn't behind you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just fucking go ahead and start Googling.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: You just wanted to know what election day
was so you could think about requesting it
[SPEAKER_05]: off because civic pride is important to
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you're at work, just go to the
bathroom and act like you're taking a
[SPEAKER_06]: dump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go in there and Google that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come back out and tell all of your friends
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay, you're blushing like a
motherfucker from now on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm laughing so hard over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know sometimes, you know you've gone
in there and taken like a seven minute pee
[SPEAKER_06]: just because you're in there checking
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how big that place is?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like not even a liable way to hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like viable, not liable.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can hear you double tap when you like
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can drop a pin in there and they'd
hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This got weird again.
Anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think something that Mike said on the
last podcast though that's really
[SPEAKER_03]: important to say again though is that a
lot of people this year are up for
[SPEAKER_03]: reelection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we get the right people in the
right seats, we could be looking at this
[SPEAKER_03]: moving a lot faster than we really thought
it was going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already at the breaking point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at 24.
[SPEAKER_03]: 24 plus DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still looking at 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at the halfway mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because my dad said something
really interesting to me the other day
[SPEAKER_03]: that at this point in gay marriage,
it had already steamrolled and it went
[SPEAKER_03]: across all 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we just have to hold on for a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess who showed up in big groups and
voted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_05]: You win yourself a tasty dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew, but I didn't, I didn't know the
appropriate way to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to, shout out to my sisters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I left that up to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of fun checking out chicks
with Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely a fun thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're blushing before you can blush more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep blushing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't see it on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to tell them about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody that listens is our friend.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I yell at you a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to motivate you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike doesn't mean to be a, no,
Mike does mean to be motivating and
[SPEAKER_06]: inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wants you to go out and vote.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a chance that we can lose
recreational cannabis in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Politics and public opinion work on a
pendulum.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at your history, we swing from
liberal to conservative socially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so social issues like this can swing
back quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the early seventies, we had a president
that was thinking about legalizing
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana nationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a number of states that had passed
medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody remember these when we were
children?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the fucking eighties happened and
public opinion swung back the other way
[SPEAKER_05]: hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We decided to do a war on drugs instead of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know how that played out and had a
couple of candidates stayed in the
[SPEAKER_05]: election or done better running up to this
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could still have candidates that were
promising to send the military to stop
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado's weed stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's a reality in 2016 that we have
a major popular, well-funded candidate for
[SPEAKER_05]: the highest office in the land.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's talking about sending the army to
shut down weed stores in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys work in the retail.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to do one day when a
tank rolls up into the fucking parking
[SPEAKER_06]: lot?
[SPEAKER_06]: Silence.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both just because I work in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I don't know if that,
well, I guess if it, if it goes away for
[SPEAKER_03]: good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there first in the spring.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're already in the spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the tank shows up, I'm going to stop
worrying about the consumption on site
[SPEAKER_05]: rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a dab real quick and bounce with my
new rig as much hash as I can carry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of new rig back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I would just have to look
over and be like my bad hunt and start
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly like set up a station real quick
and be like, so who wants to go out real
[SPEAKER_03]: fast?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go outside and yell at the
tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who the fuck is your boss?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I don't think that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they think that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they'd be surprised that I
was like, who wants to help me carry all
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff that we can carry out this
window that's on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: building from the tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much can we shove in our pockets and
get out of here?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm boofing Akif Cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it weird?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is, did I take the lid off or
not?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiny bubbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the weirdest podcasts I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cause it started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tweet us your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It started around, it started after
midnight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Start dabbing at 1140 to record.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is bound to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a great day though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, big, big, huge respect to everybody
that I had fun with today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know who I always shout out to?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, fucking Cooper, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you're doing the 22 pushups every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you started off really like a wiggle
worm by like day three, bro, you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: pushups, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I think it's inspiring that you
actually, uh, posted the videos from the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning when you knew you weren't
killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm sure by day 22, you're going to
look like a fucking Marine dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people wouldn't even have the
heart or the balls to try it, let alone
[SPEAKER_06]: post the videos that you posted.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay's over here putting her hand up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, I don't even know if I could throw
down 22 to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't 22 girl ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you in 22 girl ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I told you that story,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That hunt had posted it and he had called
out all of the Nugs family and I'd liked
[SPEAKER_03]: it by a accident before I like read
through the whole comment and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: now I'm like obligated, but like,
I don't know how to do pushups.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's who I was going to give a shout out
to next was our boy hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: You like something without reading the
whole post and now you have to like learn
[SPEAKER_05]: a new physical activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't like unlike it because I
feel like that was rude too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, not like he would have
noticed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was like, all right, I'm just going
to leave this here like pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But big shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're talking about is the 22 pushups
for veterans because, uh, every so
[SPEAKER_06]: frequently, I don't remember the stats.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the post.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's every day, every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day, 22 veterans commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of my friends are posting to
Facebook videos of themselves doing 22
[SPEAKER_06]: pushups every day for 22 days straight to
raise awareness for veterans, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: to show support for veterans, to help out,
to encourage people to reach out to
[SPEAKER_06]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a big shout out to John Hunt,
not just for doing this pushup challenge,
[SPEAKER_06]: but cause he's a bad motherfucker every
single day in every single way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that dude's an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: He inspired coop to do pushups.
[SPEAKER_06]: He inspired me to do some pushups.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to inspire Lindsey to do them
before too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he, he pushes everybody to the next
level, uh, in all aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an inside joke, uh, aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if you hang out with hunt one time,
you'll see why I use the word aspects,
[SPEAKER_06]: but a shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, yeah, some people that deserve to
shout out and everybody just nods for
[SPEAKER_06]: sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't hear our nods.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always think of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started nodding.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and if I'm going to talk about
veterans, I didn't plan, this wasn't part
[SPEAKER_06]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to give a shout out to coupon
hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Steve DeFino, my friend, uh,
you deserve a huge shout out for what you
[SPEAKER_06]: do at the veteran farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are a veteran or have a friend
or relative that's a veteran, make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: you get them in touch with the veteran
farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a listener that sent me a message
saying they wanted to get in touch with
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve and I gave Steve your contact info
is easier for me to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve said he's attempted to contact you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that has gone through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that was random.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a sidebar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but shout out to, uh, all the people
raising awareness for the veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a, we need to be doing a lot more
and anything to raise awareness I'm for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: For anything that's worth raising
awareness for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been going for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, anybody got any final words to say
while you've got a microphone in front of
[SPEAKER_06]: you and a whole bunch of people are going
to hear your opinions and thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I laid down pretty much what I had to lay
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you did go out and get your shit
registered to vote and vote when the time
[SPEAKER_06]: comes because if we don't, we're going to
lose fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just seriously, we don't want to start
taking steps back now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and that's what could easily happen
in, uh, the next couple of election
[SPEAKER_05]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can really walk this backwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: How can people find you on Twitter?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find me at, uh, at NemoPunk15 on
Twitter or at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: Laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you support Mike's Pueblo for
Sensible Cannabis Laws Facebook page.

[SPEAKER_06]: He knows a lot about local cannabis laws
and rules.

that were on the shelf that were grown by
[SPEAKER_06]: me that are probably sold out by the time
this episode drops?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they, they will definitely be gone,
but there'll be more of those strains on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shelves later, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be more stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, uh, we are going to keep good
stuff coming on the shelves.

[SPEAKER_06]: Well now it's Friday morning, Thursday
night at 1 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're recording a podcast taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, once again, I do have to give huge
love to my friends at elevate glass for
[SPEAKER_06]: this new recycler ring that they gave me a
shout out to all the lovely ladies and the
[SPEAKER_06]: one gentleman down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also shout out to the adorable little
dogs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the one dog ate a packet of Taco bell
hot sauce and it smelled like an atomic
[SPEAKER_06]: bomb went off.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that store for a couple of seconds,
but it was really funny because the dog is
[SPEAKER_06]: so cute that it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The look on your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know what dogs you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've been in there before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I can only imagine they're so
cute though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You dropped a bomb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so shout out to all my, my lovely
friends over at elevate glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they treat me like royalty there.

podcast.

five stars.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do what you think I deserve.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think asking for five stars might've
been like a cheap thing to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not cool.

[SPEAKER_06]: Give me what you really feel that I
deserve.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for certain because I'm working
with the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: God put me to a test and said he'd lend a
hand and told me he would mow me to an
[SPEAKER_02]: independent man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm looking at me and I'm a little
more better.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mama ain't losing a dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just won't let her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to spread a message of positivity
and an opportunity is what you're giving
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'ma spread my love from the sea now to
the babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect for my brethren.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smiles for the ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look, but you can't touch,
because I might hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking clean in them Rockaway jeans and
that white shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I might flirt, but that's my
downfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many lovely ladies and I think I love
them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot to give.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I got to live.
And like the homie Pato told me,
stay positive.

and Mystic Roots Band, Chico, California.
