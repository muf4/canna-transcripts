[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 612 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a few
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 club are the folks who
support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[SPEAKER_00]: level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's start off
with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else to say,
but shout out to Giant Mike and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing Queen on their marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see two beautiful people
attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys belong together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hung out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You two are meant to be together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that goes well forever for the rest
of all of our lives for eternity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some celebratory dabs whenever we're
allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long that's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have to break some rules,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be cause for breaking some rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send me hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send me email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how she goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on lockdown for a fucking year,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take some dabs with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get mad at me for thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every man's got his fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, congrats to Giant Mike and the
Dabbing Queen on their marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me give a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Giant Mike, not White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike has been married for quite some
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lovely wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to drop her name on here,
but White Mike that comes on the show has
[SPEAKER_00]: been chained down for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lovely wife, two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congrats a long time ago on your
wedding, buddy, but that's not the Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys don't send that Mike wedding
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He won't know what the fuck you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to Mrs. White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to drop her name on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: She probably would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, congrats to the official
Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen on the
[SPEAKER_00]: marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I was rambling, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the dabs, not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we pull this shit out of the weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: We go right to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part of the podcast is where I'm
going to answer grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow questions came from this one
came from the grow help tab on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you visit my website, I read genetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spot where it says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask your grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask a short list of preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you basic things like what strain
are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lights are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few things to give me some hints at
what can solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to makes it easier for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like going to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know your blood pressure,
your heart rate, your temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much you weigh, a few basic questions
before you even see the doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give me a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like giving the doctor a few
couple of basic questions before we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump right to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm so rambling today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bubblegum TKD 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it fucking worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because some people ask, what am I
dabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't care to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to I read genetics.com,
click on the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill out the little grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will send you the part where you can
ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in here a name to use on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not answer that part,
so we're not going to say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain they're growing is motor breath
number 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing it indoors under LED
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the vegetative stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about four weeks into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last feed was at the time of this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was today, February 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of that feeding was 6.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have maybe gone up a little higher
on the pH, but so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM or EC of the last feeding was 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the right ranges there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime temperature, 68 to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could come up a little bit,
but it's cold as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at you for being a little bit
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold as shit in my grow spaces right
now, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do much about it, but plug in more
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to run out of lights and space
pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime temperature, 64 to 66.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime relative humidity is 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime, 55%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's acceptable within acceptable range
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, I love your content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my second grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: First grow had almost no issues,
but on this one, I'm having droopy fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, droopy fan leaves can be a lot of
signs of a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a picture included.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add that here in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The droopy fan leaves are on the old and
new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing in the basement in tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my temps have been kind of cold,
so that's an indicator right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm having trouble pinpointing this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a legal caregiver, so I'm worried
because my patients are depending on me to
[SPEAKER_00]: pump out the dank like I did last run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your second grow and you're a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a little bit of cart before the
horse syndrome there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would master growing, not master it,
but at least get comfortable at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: get really good at it before you've got a
lot of people relying on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate and respect what you're
doing, but get good at this before you get
[SPEAKER_00]: too many people relying on you too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's none of my business, I guess,
but that's my advice as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a caregiver, was a caregiver
since the beginning of the medical stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice is get good before you get
people relying on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you're never worried about your
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my nutrients are house and garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also using recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not under watering,
but I know I'm watering less often this
[SPEAKER_00]: run than last.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold, so they're probably not
drinking as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a picture here that's going to
give me some details and help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hand water at 10 to 20% runoff when the
pots get light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 480 watt LED quantum board in
each tent with infinity T6 inline fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any help is greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the photo here in my laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump to that real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a lot going on here,
so I can tell by looking at this photo
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to post right about here in
the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several hints here as to what's
going wrong in this photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that I can see is that if
you look at the bottom and the little
[SPEAKER_00]: catch tray, the saucer in which the pot is
sitting, there's quite a bit of standing
[SPEAKER_00]: water in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The condition of that pot, the outer
moisture here on the outside of the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the color of that runoff water inside of
that pot, the saucer, the condition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: saucer indicate to me that this plant sits
in water too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting in that overwatering for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting in this water at the bottom
of the tray for too long, and it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you're putting this plant's
feet, maybe it's balls, in cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I just sat you ... Let me fix
my hat so you could see my face here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I just sat you, your feet,
your toes, your balls in cold water all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long and just made you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of what you're doing to this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main issue is that it is
simply overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secondary issue that it's sitting in
that water for too long your third issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just compounding everything else,
is that that cold water in which it is
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting is cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have them up on those little tiny
risers, but that water is still getting
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to stop that water from
getting a little bit chilly, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: unhappy with that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to see what else I can see by
your picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you got the temperature under
control in there and stopped overwatering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that those plants would be less
droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the main thing causing this
droop is overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is they're sitting in
that stagnant water for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third thing is they're probably a
little bit too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are overall too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason which will lead to plants
doing a droop like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't think this is what's
happening here, but this is a possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: for other people with droopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when your plants reach their
daily light integral, they will just take
[SPEAKER_00]: a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just droop their leaves down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they've had enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily light integral, DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you're at work and you're
done and you're tired, and you lean
[SPEAKER_00]: against the wall and you go, ah,
that's what the plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a wall to lean against.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go, shit, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just put their leaves down and
they take a little bit of a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're telling you, I've had my daily
light integral unless you want to keep me
[SPEAKER_00]: on so that I don't flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could possibly reduce the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could reduce the amount of lumens I'm
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do changes based on what you're
seeing on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think is happening here,
honestly, is it's a basic overwater,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is compounding into multiple issues
because of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I didn't miss anything on the
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have lots of standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have those little tiny risers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how cold that floor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're in the basement in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That floor may be getting colder than
you're anticipating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to double or triple those
little risers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get another pot, flip the pot upside
down, put it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think the main issue is the
overwater and the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold water sitting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to my friend who did not
include their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it goes when you dry those
plants out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one recommendation I can make while
I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem to be overwatering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a podcast episode called Water
Tech 1 through 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall the episode number right
off the top of my head, but through the
[SPEAKER_00]: magic of technology, I'll drop that
episode number right about here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you guys can watch 1 through 5
Water Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an audio podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a video that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just my face or a static
screen, some sort of image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an older show, but that will give you
great advice on how to water these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: without so many issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would do something about that
standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting 10 to 20% runoff,
but it's just sitting in that tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe get a shop vac and suck that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe, I don't know, you got to do
something about that standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shop vac is probably the ideal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you raise them up off of something up
off the ground onto something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put a container underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that plastic saucer that you're
using, you can kind of push the edge of it
[SPEAKER_00]: like your finger with your finger and make
like a spout, like on a pitcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tee pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just make that little corner and
the water will pour right out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: into a vessel that you could slide
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would get the water out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help you out 1 through 5 Water
Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that episode number should be
right about here ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to move on to the
next question in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Z nice and
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, sir, I've heard a bucket of bro
science stating that taking clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from clones and so on degrades the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this person is asking is if I have
got a plant and I cut a clone of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and I grow that plant, that plant is
now going to become this hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who are watching the video,
I've got this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut this part off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two plants now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, this one's going to go away
and I've only got plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I guess we're going to call it,
which is just a clone of plant number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually I'm going to cut clones off
of plant number two, and I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: plant number two in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the clones, which are now
clone number three, and I'm going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep one as a mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I'll throw some of those in the
flower room, some more along the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to cut clones off of number
three and make clone number four clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three will get too tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll need to refresh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the long run, if you do it
correctly, if you follow standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedures, if your donor plants
do not get any stress or overwhelming
[SPEAKER_00]: stress or overwhelming diseases or
overwhelming pest pressure, in most cases
[SPEAKER_00]: you will not see any change in those
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not degrade the quality on those
genetics in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will still be the same thing if you
follow standard operating procedures and
[SPEAKER_00]: you use healthy donor plants and you take
clones properly, you transplant them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you care for them in a proper manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not degrade in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently got rid of my Flow mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had grown that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was time for that to be retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a Colorado cannabis grower,
with the personal grow, I'm very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: to the amount of plants I'm allowed to
play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been growing Flow since 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 2019 or 2020, I finally decided
to let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had had that plant for over 10 years,
over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way I could do that was by
cutting a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that bigger plant got tired,
got ugly, got out of shape, just cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of that, get that clone,
root it, get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably went through 20 different clone
generations of that Flow plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Metomar for
getting me that clone that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumor that that came from Ed
Rosenthal through Tom Sexton, then to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I should have said all
those names, but that's the rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that clone that I went from DJ Short to
Ed Rosenthal to Tom to myself is the rumor
[SPEAKER_00]: where that clone went.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got spread all over Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't the only one with it,
but it was a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept it from 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred everything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cloned it a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got it from that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew, I just keep repeating the same
shit, but I had it for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything smelled like Flow in my life
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consumed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, you got to get rid of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limited by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make new creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the Flow plant is one of
the things that had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, I kept that bad bitch
around for over 10 years by cutting a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moved with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved to two different houses with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a crop of Flow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a mother plant and I had a crop of
Flow in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, should I got to move when
this crop is over?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just cut a tray of all of my mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 10 of every mother plant in the tray
of clones, put them in the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: moved, set up the new grow space,
put those new clones in their new home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how the new clones got moved to
the new spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Flow has survived two moves of
different houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been moved all around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, in the long run, the short answer
is no, there will not be any change if
[SPEAKER_00]: things are done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother plant needs to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be no viral pressure,
no pest pressure, no stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs to be a healthy plant that
hasn't been worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to take clones properly,
transplant them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you should have quality copies of
copies of copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it correctly, it's not like
multiplicity where they keep coming out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little dumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the copy machine where they
keep getting a little bit diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it correctly, they should come
out just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me adjust the iry army beanie here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps crawling into my eyes,
trying to keep my face visible and be
[SPEAKER_00]: professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a couple of more minutes here
on this podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question also came from the grow help
tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from, they want us to use
the name and be shout out to my new friend
[SPEAKER_00]: and be, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they are growing granddaddy perps
and why East farms horchata.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a string called horchata.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like horchata.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing at indoors under led
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these details so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using flora flex bloom one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom two, the EC is 1.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime temperature, 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime temperature, 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity, 40% day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the part that says the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome and thank you for the
great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are contributing to the show right now
and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was running a four by two flower
tent while simultaneously running a veg
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a flower tent and a veg tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to save on electricity and bring
the veg plants into the flower tent for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're moving plants from one room to
the other to save on electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really saving electricity by
cramming all of your plants into one
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants may want the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be better off just leaving them in
the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, after we see the problem you ran into,
we determined you may be better off just
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving them in the other room overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I understand you want to bring
them in there and use that space,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hopefully your flower space is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that light is being used and you want
to give those plants, the veg plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: much light as they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would leave them where they are so they
can get all that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I just noticed that one of the
flowering plants seems to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the dreaded intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always a fucking scare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I realized the power strip had a
small light bulb in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to your light leak episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized I assumed that was the cause
that could definitely be the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of light leak may do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, am I in danger of pollinating the
vegging plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg plants are all in week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend two to three hours in a flower
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized this was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I pop some new seeds or wait three
months for more disappointing results?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very simple answer to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the simple answer to this one is you
have nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the flowering plants in your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody saw me spin on the
microphone just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm human shit happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got other plants which are in
flower in that tent, the flowering plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are at risk of being pollinated and having
seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other plants, which are, um,
somewhere between 21 and about 35 days in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, those do risk being pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little later, you won't get too
many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the pistols are shriveling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not super pollinatable right now,
but if they're at peak pollination times
[SPEAKER_00]: and that hermaphrodite popped up,
you may see some pollination on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, which are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not ask about flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you asked about is are your
vegetative plants going to get seeded?
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple answer is no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those plants have not reached sexual
maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not putting out their sex organs
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts which they need to receive
pollen to produce seeds are not even
[SPEAKER_00]: existent on those plants yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, no, you do not have anything to
worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those vegetative plants will not receive
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a long way to go before you
have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you should do is make sure you,
uh, deal with that hermaphroditic plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to pluck the nanners out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to isolate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen with that freak of
nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once that crop is done and that herm
is out of there, you need to thoroughly
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there's no pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will deactivate your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and just spray everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe cover up the lights, maybe hand wipe
the lights or something, but we got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and get a lot of water in the
room and deactivate all of the pollen that
[SPEAKER_00]: may have been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer to your question is
you have nothing to worry about because
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative plants don't have the
appropriate parts to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, they will not get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts of your plants that receive
pollen, when you put them into flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: they start making the dandelion parts,
the little pistols, the hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stigmas, that is where the pollen
lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what will get your plants pregnant
and get them seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, you don't have anything
to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend NB.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your granddaddy perp and your
horchata go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more questions,
please follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I want a rat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a quick question that I think may
be valuable to the listeners and
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard you mention on a few episodes
that you use salt based nutrients to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly use new millennium bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I also use a veg balloon
powdered nutrients and the personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one mix and a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use another mix, but those are the main
bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bottled grower, not the organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works better in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, uh, for what I'm doing,
for my budget, for my space, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also for training grow techs,
it's just easier to have bottles that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can say put this many milliliters of this
at this day and this many mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do use the bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm assuming you are
breeding everything with those same salt
[SPEAKER_00]: based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is there any scientific evidence
that shows when breeding with salt based
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, there are any discrepancies in
a future grower using those seeds in super
[SPEAKER_00]: soil without salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have my seeds tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my seeds tested in all types of
environments and, uh, living soil and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydroponics and rock wool and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have them ran organically,
non-organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them grown with love and grown with
abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see any difference in the
organic to non-organic production when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to how viable that seed is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they all grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't seen any difference in
that to tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the thing you're talking about is
called epigenetics and that's in,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me take a quick drink here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is crackling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to take a drink and deal
with it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than hearing that nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for one moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freshened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me start by saying I have no
qualifications or, uh, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just talking out of my ass right now,
but this is what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for that to be a factor, we have to
think about what did the breeder of these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds before me do whoever made the mother
plant and the father plant that I used,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whoever made the mother plant and
the father plant of that one, what type of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or soilless mix or media did they
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because evolutionary things like this
aren't going to happen over one cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I started this by saying,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but as I think about it,
evolution isn't going to happen just by
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Paul and Chuck, I do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm changing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution is happening by me selecting
things, but I don't think that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: imprinting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds enough with one cycle in my
breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the plant knows it may know
the plant knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the seed knows, uh,
that I'm growing in salts and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's going to make a difference,
but, uh, I could be completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I started this by saying,
I don't have the scientific, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: background, the education on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's epigenetics is what we're
talking about, but I think that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take more generations than just my one
breeding round.
[SPEAKER_00]: To really make a difference in that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I wish I had more details and info on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't have that education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gone to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I probably need some more deep science
in what I've got for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got a lot of bro science people,
uh, people kind of diss me sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: because I obviously am not a college
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the college thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not educated from any, uh,
botanical school, no horticultural degree
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've got though is a lot of
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing since before I should
admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been around a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in commercial, uh, private
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I don't have the schooling to
really talk about this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could teach you about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could spot a deficiency from across the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you which branch needs to be
trellised a little bit more from across a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking 75 foot gross space, but this is
not really, um, my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to talk too much out my
ass in my opinion, though, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: this would take more generations of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I bred a subcool strain and a,
let's pick somebody else that's a DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic strain, uh, subcool bred in super
soil, I don't know what DNA genetics bred
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got super soil on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say that I'm just
making this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA genetics bred in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're advanced guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hip cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably did breed in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we got one guy breeding in a super
soil, one guy breeding in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got seeds that came from super soil
seeds that came from cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm breeding those in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come from three different
environments to tell you the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, like I said before, what did whoever
subcool got his seeds from or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were they bred from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think my one step is going to
do enough evolutionary, uh, epigenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary change to really make any
decision on if there will be a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: on future grows in different media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really long way to say that,
but I had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is this genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I don't think that is the
definition of genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've defined genetic drift on another
episode and that is not what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope this makes sense and is
not a stupid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, not a stupid question at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I wish I had more information for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could answer this more
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure in the comment section on
YouTube, somebody will chime in with some
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant shit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime, uh, I am a little bit lost or
make a little bit of a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of brilliant friends of
mine that gently and politely remind me
[SPEAKER_00]: and update me and give me information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They educate me, which is, I do not feel
any shame in being educated, updated,
[SPEAKER_00]: enlightened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure, they will share all kinds of
great information with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out the YouTube comments and
somebody will have more to say about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also while I'm thinking about it,
shout out to my friend F1 Pete for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great update on F1 CrossFit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I appreciate the high quality
info and the well-produced audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a gem brother.
