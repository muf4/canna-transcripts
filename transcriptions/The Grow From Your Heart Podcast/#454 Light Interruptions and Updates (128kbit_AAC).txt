[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 454 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show was brought to
you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of something
called Holy Fuck from our friends at Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the name Holy Fuck is perfect for
this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Sex on the Beach and
Halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as Pina Colada and
Fuel on the back of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains
67.59% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see why they call it Holy Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack it open right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smells coming out of this container
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is coconut, but then there is also a
hint of gassy skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at it, it looks like a
chunk of nice butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got like a fresh chunk of butter
sitting on a tray, that is kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little piece of cheesecake just
waiting for you to nibble on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Holy Fuck live batter from Green Dot
Labs is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dab it, this stuff tastes
like you just drank a Pina Colada or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Horchata or maybe you just drank some
coconut milk with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: pineapple juice in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes ridiculously good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, you get a sweetness
with a little bit of fuel that just
[SPEAKER_00]: lingers for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really impressive concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad I picked this one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot
Labs for the Holy Fuck live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to read a
listener email.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's do a shout
out to some of our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to our
friend Brian B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant shout out to Jacob
W.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
shout out to our friend Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant shout out to our buddy
Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I need to send a shout out to
my friend Dick Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to my friend Glenn G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast shout out and a thank you to my
friend Kana You Dig It.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am going to
get to that email that I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's chat for a few minutes before we
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of things I would like
to tell you about before we get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something I got to do
just a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I was given a clone of the Mac
One cut by a very good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he wants a shout out on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he doesn't want everybody else
messaging him, asking him for a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big private personal shout out to my
friend who gave me a clone of the Mac One.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Mac One is one of the slowest growing
plants I have ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is being fed great nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is in a great environment,
but it does not want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody I talk to says that the Mac
grows ridiculously slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got her happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to take a clone off the Mac,
so I've got a large veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a clone that is rooted and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's working as my backup mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have since then dragged my Mac One cut
into my flowering room and it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by my rise male known as King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have officially pollinated the Mac
One cut with my prized King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that the pollination took.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that there are a few spots where
seeds are actually developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect a lot of seeds,
but I should get at least a few seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself to play with out of this first
initial cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many other breeders have told me that the
Mac is hard to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have said that it does not take
pollen well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it does not produce a lot of
seeds and oftentimes the progeny is very
[SPEAKER_00]: unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what to expect from my Mac
to arise cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I have smoked the Mac,
it has been a memorable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor of the Mac is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz from the Mac is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downside to this plant is the way
that it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am hoping that by pollinating it by my
arise male that I will fix that slow
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and give this plant a little more
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That King Solomon plant is known to put
hyper vigor into its hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully out of the few seeds I did
generate, I will be able to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype in there that is very
representative of the Mac potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very representative of the Mac flavor,
but I can correct the growth problems by
[SPEAKER_00]: using that robust, really vigorous arise
male and hopefully put that trait into the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny, find a phenotype that is a
perfect 50-50 balance, and then we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to do with that from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, this is just a personal project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to play with the Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was kind enough to gift me a
clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a known breeder, I think the next step
is for me to pollinate this plant and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what we create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at least 40 to 50 days away from
these seeds being harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will have no feedback for you for at
least 40 to 50 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will harvest the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once the plant is dry, I will crumble
up the buds into a dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will pull the seeds out and count
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be your next update.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many seeds did I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, when I do have time and space,
I will grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guarantee you that when I grow out
those Mac ones, one to arise seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see ridiculous amounts of photos
and a lot of updates here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please stick around, please stay tuned,
and I will keep you updated as that
[SPEAKER_00]: project progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another fun thing I have been working on
is watching my friends receive their new
[SPEAKER_00]: testers of something I am calling the red
pill or the blue pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made some testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the space to test them in my
personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have recruited some very reliable
friends to test grow these seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of the packages have landed at my
friend's locations and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am excited to watch the testing of
the red pill and the blue pill unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a third option that some
people received.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a rare Indica dominant cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the things I make are very Sativa
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to be heavy on the
Indica side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm quite excited to see what comes
from these tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sent out the red pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sent out the blue pill and I've sent
out the Indica dominant cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before too long, we will start seeing
progress photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I find really entertaining
is I just randomly labeled these seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: the red pill or the blue pill and offered
them to my friends as testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, would you like the red pill or
the blue pill?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just an arbitrary name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the plants
themselves, with the seeds themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to pick a label that was
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red pill or the blue pill sounded like
a fun offering for my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part of the whole situation was
that everybody who was given the option
[SPEAKER_00]: selected the red pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody selected the blue pill when given
the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of weird
psychological game that was, but I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very interesting that everybody
selected the red pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of great tester seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start seeing photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start giving you more reports and
more updates on those testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will let you know if they will be
released to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once testing is complete, before I
release them, I will announce the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and the official release name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a tester, please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, I will tell you everything
about those seeds when the time is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm sure a lot of people are saying
Rasta Jeff has test growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure a lot of those people are
wondering, how do I become one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you right now, the easiest way
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to become a tester for
iRegenetics, all you have to do is send an
[SPEAKER_00]: email to iRegenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the subject line, put tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in your email, impress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain to me why you feel like you are
qualified to test grow seeds for me before
[SPEAKER_00]: I release them to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need people who can take good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need people who can communicate well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need people who can take quality
photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need people who are not going to get
these seeds and disappear on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you can be a reliable tester
for iRegenetics seeds, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iRegenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to put the word tester in the
subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the body of that email,
impress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know why you are qualified to test
my unreleased seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictures will go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about looking at my friends'
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes time to select testers,
sometimes I randomly go to my friends who
[SPEAKER_00]: have posted good photos and I say,
hey bro, would you like to test some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And 90% of the time they say, yes,
I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good photos go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take good notes, if you can
stay in touch with me throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grow, and if you can take quality
photos, you may qualify to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegenetics tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the email address is
iRegenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you put the word tester in the
subject line and make sure you impress me
[SPEAKER_00]: in your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing to ramble about
before we get into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something I've been
focused on for most of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a little bit limited on how much I'm
allowed to share on this project,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have spent most of my week working
on a revised floor plan and an application
[SPEAKER_00]: to open one of the first medical marijuana
cultivation facilities in another state
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just about ready to roll out
their medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you too many details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you that I have been
working day and night for the past week,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting an application filled out,
making sure that all of the questions are
[SPEAKER_00]: answered sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with a large team to
make sure that this project goes smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we officially finished our
application process and the application
[SPEAKER_00]: has been turned in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we completed all of the
questions to the best of our ability and
[SPEAKER_00]: we stand a very good chance of being
granted our requested license for a large
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm sure by now a lot of people are
going, oh, shit, is Rasta Jeff going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not relocating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new project may require a little bit
more travel, but I can do 75 to 85 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the work that is required online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is done through video chat and
conference calls and Google Docs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes things very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am working very closely with this
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have designed a very nice facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have created a very nice workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we stand a very good
chance of having our application approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the very near future, I should be
able to announce that in another state,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be an irie genetics run large
scale medical marijuana cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can't celebrate yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to have the license
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like we stand a very good
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we don't get approved,
I learned a lot in this application
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new state had a lot of very detailed
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen an application like this
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They broke it down into several
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way that this place is
rolling out their medical marijuana rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very well with cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very well with dispensary owners
or potential dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like they want to understand
the industry more than they want to limit
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another state I work with, I feel like
they just keep setting up hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you want medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, do a backflip over this and
then roll through this fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to fucking tug on this
rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to go through an American
Ninja Warrior course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this other state, it feels like
they're saying, oh, you want medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to make this happen for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this new state is very welcoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it is going to be a very
great roll out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the group that I'm involved with
get our license approved or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still very proud to have been a part
of the project that I am participating in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am still very excited to see how
this state rolls out their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with all of that being said,
let's talk about how tedious these
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were hundreds of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a team of us weeks to answer all
of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would submit the questions to the team,
the lawyers and everybody else,
[SPEAKER_00]: the architects and whoever else wanted to
get involved would all read the questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitpick it and pick it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get an email and it says,
hey, your answer was close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a few more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rework it and then send it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the process would happen all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a very long time to get every
thing worded to where it was acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: for the lawyers, for the doctor side,
for the cultivator side, for the state
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to word everything to where it all
made sense, to where everybody could
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes a lot of time and a lot of
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We designed an entire plan from planting a
seed to a patient consuming our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got every detail written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a great chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after spending a couple of weeks on a
project like this, I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how much businesses need your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any business that is open and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it is Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it is the most giant mall
filled with stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what type of business it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every business needs customer and
community support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of energy and we put a lot of
effort into establishing a solid business
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can offer a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just opening a business so that
we can make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that listens to this show knows
that I am very passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am passionate about recreational
cannabis and I am passionate about medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a strong, heavy cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis saved my life and cannabis
continues to save my life and the lives of
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends and family on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see other people enjoy cannabis
the way that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see other people feel relief by
using cannabis in a way that improves the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only am I in the cannabis industry
for the business aspect, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to buy nice drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to eat like a fucking king.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke good concentrates,
but that is not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in this industry because I am
passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like watching a person improve the
quality of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: By consuming a product that I created or
grew or invested my time and energy in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see people who have a discomfort
or an ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up and they're like,
I don't feel well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave with the product and they come
back several days later and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, that whatever product it was
that you gave me made my whatever problem
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had go away for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to hang out with my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to enjoy a few minutes with my
children and not feel like a grumpy
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole because whatever hurts was
hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever bothers me was bothering me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to offer a great service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to produce a product that makes
people feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the retail end of my business,
I get to get that product out to those
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in turn, yes, we do make a few dollars
and we pay the rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without the support of our community
and the support of our, I hate the word
[SPEAKER_00]: customers, our patients, our clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: My passion just becomes a hobby without
the support of our community and our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate using the word customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without them, those businesses,
the dispensary will be forced to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that dispensary closes, there's no
need for the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cultivation will close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes for any business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't go to whatever your favorite
coffee spot is or your favorite sandwich
[SPEAKER_00]: spot and spend a few bucks every
occasionally, when you do think about
[SPEAKER_00]: going to that sandwich shop, it will
probably be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very competitive economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very competitive market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any business has to do everything that
they can to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I'm saying with all of
this rambling is please support your local
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, whether they're dispensaries,
whether they're your local favorite taco
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, whether it's your local favorite
waffle cone ice cream truck, shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy Koop Dogg, whatever that business
is, please support the businesses that do
[SPEAKER_00]: quality service for your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want you to support the
dispensaries, which I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want you to support the
places where my cultivated product ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: and the places I do consultations for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your local dispensary needs your
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your local whatever needs your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get out there and support our
local businesses and let's kind of stop
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the infighting and the bickering
about dispensaries and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of rules and regulations
and hoops to jump through that make things
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit difficult sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make medicine available to
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the most potent, the highest
quality, the cleanest, safest,
[SPEAKER_00]: most effective medicine that a patient can
get at the best price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that we're out there just
trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get medicine to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what causes hiccups or problems
are regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those we cannot avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give you a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have some hatred and
some kind of grief against dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and against commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please understand we are out here doing
our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't make up a lot of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't make up a lot of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were up to us, we would grow the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just open the back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys would come in and pay two or
three bucks a gram and smoke out while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're rolling it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there are rules and
regulations that come with legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have got to follow them if we want
to continue to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the dispensaries and
the cultivations are businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't operate them, as a
business, they won't be there the next
[SPEAKER_00]: time you go to shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if it were that easy to set
up a cultivation facility and produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, clean, safe product on a reliable
schedule, wouldn't everybody else already
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The professionals are out there trying our
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bear with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's end the public versus the
dispensary, the black market versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to end all of that and let's
just be team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough public service
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any cultivation or cannabis
culture questions, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first email in this episode comes
from a person who did not include their
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at day 37 of 12-12 today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're 37 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I have two lights on a
digital timer and one on a tab timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a storm hit four days ago and the
electric went out for about an hour right
[SPEAKER_00]: after the lights came on for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of already see where this email
is headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, the digital timer was fine
because it holds the time if it cuts off
[SPEAKER_00]: or implugs, but the tab timer stopped for
about an hour while the power was out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk about what happened there
because some people may not have caught
[SPEAKER_00]: onto that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has two different timers in
their grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got lights plugged into both
timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have both timers set for 12-12 to
where both timers come on at a given time,
[SPEAKER_00]: both go off at a given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the power went out in this
person's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the digital timer kept on ticking with
the correct time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There on the other light, there is a timer
with little push tabs that you push down
[SPEAKER_00]: for the light to be on and you pop them up
for the light to be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the opposite, but it doesn't
matter right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push tabs and the lights either offer
on when it's on that section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it goes to the other
section, it does the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timer has a dial on it that spins
like a real clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what triggers the switch to go
on or off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when the power stops, that timer
stops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not spin anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the power went out at one o'clock,
that grow room, that timer thought that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was one o'clock until the power came back
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time stood still for that one timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The digital timer resumed its normal
schedule when the power came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights came on just like it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything functioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when the lights were scheduled to go
off is when we had our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that one timer was off for a
duration of time, it is now behind by that
[SPEAKER_00]: exact duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the digital timer clicked off,
our spinny dial timer continued to light
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's catch up with the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, the digital timer was fine
because it holds the time if it cuts off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the tab timer stopped for one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had one extra hour of light time at
the end of that flowering day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, So my question is, since my girls
are used to total darkness starting at six
[SPEAKER_00]: p.m., is it going to hurt anything now
that they have been getting one extra hour
[SPEAKER_00]: of light for four days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your podcast has helped me and mine more
than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I've helped you out a couple
of times in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that I can help you out again this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for four days, you had an extra one
hour of light in your flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were 37 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a couple of things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are nearly 40 days into the flowering
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am hoping that this light interruption
did not cause any hermaphrodite issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interruptions of the dark cycle are the
number one trigger for hermaphrodites in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your plants herm, we'll be up to a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How stable are those genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen those plants herm
before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they ever hermed out due to any other
type of stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you may see some hermaphrodites in
this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the plants may be too far into flower
to herm on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may just be so far into flower that
they're like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even care that you interrupted us
for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to the genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, being that late into the flowering
phase, if they do decide to herm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some bananas pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove those bananas if you'd
like, but you are so close to harvest that
[SPEAKER_00]: you won't have time to produce mature
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It generally takes four to six weeks to
develop a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are probably going to come
down much sooner than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some small white seeds in
your crop, but again, that just depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what plants you've got in
your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what other stressors you've
got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they've been fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got other
environmental factors that may contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to stress that may lead to these plants
showing hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, you've got about 23 to
30 days left on your flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get them back on 12-12 as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also get rid of that tab timer and
replace it with another digital timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've learned your lesson,
and I'm sure that a lot of other people
[SPEAKER_00]: listening have just learned a very
valuable lesson through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of that tab timer and get
yourself another digital timer so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have this problem again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got the time corrected,
you have to pay close attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see little hermaphrodite flowers
pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see those, you need to consider
your next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to pluck those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to cut off that branch?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how many nanners or
male flowers you see developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just one or two, I may spray it
with a little water and then pluck it with
[SPEAKER_00]: tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how far along in the flower,
I honestly may just leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, hermaphrodite flowers that
pop up that late in flower are sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not contain any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you may not want to run
the risk of a male plant that may or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not contain pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to spray those,
remove them with tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are a lot in one bud,
cut out the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lot in one branch,
cut out the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are a lot on one plant,
it is time to consider removing that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are showing hermaphroditic
traits from this light interruption,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider different cultivars for
my next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that these plants have the
potential for hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't grow those again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get rid of them and find something
that does not show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first plan of attack is to get
these lights back on 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your next step is to get rid of that piece
of shit timer and get something more
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to pay close attention to
these plants throughout the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hope that you don't see any
hermaphrodite flowers pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, you have got to re-strategize
at that point and consider your options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cut the flowers out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cut the buds out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cut the branch out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cut the plant out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you ignore it and let it grow like
business as usual?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you learn something from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've already replaced that
timer and hopefully everybody listening
[SPEAKER_00]: that has one of those piece of shit tab
timers is jumping on Amazon and replacing
[SPEAKER_00]: it with something digital right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you did not sign this email with your
name, so I don't know who to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I can say is, hey, thank you for
