[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koo, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hope everybody's feeling as good
as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am smoking some
Lemon Jeffrey Ambrosia from my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some amazing concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambrosia is their live resin line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it ambrosia to differentiate
themselves, to separate themselves from
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their ambrosia line is always delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a sappy, real terpy,
live resin product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly priced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Lemon Jeffrey tastes so good,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells like a scented candle in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the abrupt drop in music there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain that here in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like a lemon candle in
the room or like some lemon heads in a
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you take a dab, it just
coats your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lemon candy flavor just coats your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get this amazing like a
freaking just a head high that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: not believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it hard to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it hard to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes everything cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I freaking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work on this Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at Elevation,
or maybe it's called Elevations in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a medical only dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on Razorback Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call before you drive because they don't
always have Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy a lot of it as soon as it goes on
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people buy it up because I talk about
it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you call before you go to
Elevation in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can check out the Apothecary
Store in Colorado Springs while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not too far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turned down the music really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came home from work and my little
recording area, my recording table had a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice puddle of water all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, this oil slick pad has saved so
much bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time the email came on while the coil
was sitting on the table and it heated up
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not burn the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I had a roof leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a chandelier just above my
table where I record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been fucking thunderstorms,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainstorms, hailstorms, thunderstorms for
the past month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard me talk about it on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had random power outages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wi-Fi and cable have been out a lot
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of sketchy trying to rely
on electricity and Wi-Fi, but the rain has
[SPEAKER_00]: been here and it knocked some shit off my
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucked up my roof a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a little bit of water getting in
my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I planned on recording yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not do it because my table,
my recording area was all wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I am a completely lucky man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank Jah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually this computer that I'm recording
with right now is sitting directly in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me, which is directly under the
chandelier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave it here sometimes if I'm doing
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, I took it in the grow
room because I was looking up a grow chart
[SPEAKER_00]: from something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see some stuff and I had it in
the grow room and I left it on the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grow and it did not get wet,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so fucking lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer did not get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a puddle of water about,
I don't know, I can reach, I can put one
[SPEAKER_00]: hand where the water was and I can
completely reach my mixing board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 14 channel Mackie 1402VLZ3
mixer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an expensive fucking piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right underneath that is a live wire power
Furman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a power conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps all my power smooth so that I
don't get power fluctuations in my
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment because that will burn out my
recording gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath that is a DBX compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of expensive piece of gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps all the background noise
out of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what makes me sound crispy and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what limits me so that if I yell into
the microphone real bad, it doesn't blow
[SPEAKER_00]: up your ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did get louder, but it didn't blow out
because I was actually really much louder
[SPEAKER_00]: than what you heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm snapping my fingers to the right
and left of the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear that shit because of the
compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then underneath that is a TASCAM US1200,
which is a USB.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes all of my audio signal become a
digital signal, which runs into my
[SPEAKER_00]: MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit got wet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank Jah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you believe in, thank that for me
because all my shit could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's thousands of dollars worth of
equipment that could have been fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I had a bunch of hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard me talk about going to
Apothecary and buying a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, all of the water went the
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My e-nail and a Hitman rig and a bunch of
concentrates were sitting on the table and
[SPEAKER_00]: the water went to the left and my shit was
to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was looking out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got water in my house, but something was
fucking looking out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of that talk about the water in
the house in my recording area,
[SPEAKER_00]: this means that I'm going to have
contractors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have roofers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were roofers here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people in the crawl space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people in the attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing two episodes a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing the Thursday episodes that
are long and these Monday episodes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are regular length until I get my roof
fixed in my recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recording area cleaned up and figured
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot promise you two episodes a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my absolute best to give you one
episode a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still bring you my Monday episodes,
but the Thursday episodes may disappear
[SPEAKER_00]: just until I get this recording area
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful trying to get this all set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's going to rain
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it rains again, the water is going to
come pouring through there because the
[SPEAKER_00]: roof is not fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get done recording, I move all of
my shit off this area and I cover up what
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't carry because some of the stuff is
heavy and some of it's bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cover it with trash bags and I'm dealing
with a roof leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for maybe not putting out
Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how shit goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have contractors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house may be a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be going somewhere else to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to promise anything I cannot
deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize in advance if I skip a
Thursday episode or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put out a Monday episode even if
it's just me saying, hey, what's up
[SPEAKER_00]: fuckers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come and do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Thursday, that's what's going on in my
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a fucking roof leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to disrupt some shit for
an undetermined amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing out of my pocket,
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all insurance and homeowner crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bullshit to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually really lucky because nothing
got destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got water in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the dining room table and on the
kitchen floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got tile in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been much fucking worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was scary, but it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been talking about that
for a long fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for letting me rant about it and
release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was stressing me the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a roof leak in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that your house is where you can
put all your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work hard for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work hard for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few thieves and fucking
scumbags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck a thief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people out there that work
hard for their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a nice home to put your
shit in and you feel like your home is a
[SPEAKER_00]: secure place for your belongings and to
come home and find your shit wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a heartbreaking feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my chest sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in the house and I could hear
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, there's not water that
should be running in that where that sound
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of fucked with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, thanks for being my
therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me get that off my
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just going to be a therapeutic
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some emails and stuff I would
like to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get there, let me do a couple
of quick things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to tell you guys about
Patreon or I guess I'd like to remind you
[SPEAKER_00]: about Patreon because I talk about it all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who haven't heard and if
you're not already tired of hearing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, Patreon is a service that would allow
you as a listener to financially
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
dollar or two of your time, you can go to
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the info that you need will be
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up for a one time
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up for a monthly
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contribute as little as one
dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly don't think there's a
minimum or a maximum on how many nines or
[SPEAKER_00]: zeros you can put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in a whole bunch of nines.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to get rich on
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't think I'm trying to become
a millionaire off of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to do is offset the cost
of my web hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost me a little bit of money to have a
website where I host the podcast and I pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for that out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want help covering that cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't want to cover it and if
you can't help me, I don't mind covering
[SPEAKER_00]: it myself, but I'd rather not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to throw down a buck or
two to help me pay for that, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit begging, but I want you
to know that it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people are like him and I'd love
to send you a buck or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: PayPal will not accept donations because I
have the word cannabis in my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say the word cannabis all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website has the word cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do not want anything to do with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to find another service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon, you contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon sends the money to my PayPal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little buffer zone,
helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to send a huge thank you to
everybody who has contributed to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've sent me $1 or if you've sent me
a lot of dollars, every dollar matters and
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you cannot contribute to
Patreon and you're listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is free for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few people out there that can
contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will cover you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody can throw down money for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm doing it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to spend the money on your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still love everybody equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to move on because I
feel like I'm ranting about Patreon for
[SPEAKER_00]: way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me remind you about my social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Twitter, you can find me under at GFYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love the interaction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Facebook, it's the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give that a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love it if you followed me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make regular and feminized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available at thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot ship you anything personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not send seeds to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're here in Colorado, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have some gifts or trades available
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am rambling on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me what Iri means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri is just the best you could feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that feeling when you're sitting
under a tree on a sunny day and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind's kind of blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hair's blowing back, not hitting you
in the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You maybe got your best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your best friend next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your dog's with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass is that nice, cool feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when the grass feels good to sit
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have no shoes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're smoking a little joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that feeling when you're just like,
damn, I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just feeling Iri.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of versions of Iri,
but right now, that's the one we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feeling Iri, feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get me back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super blazed from this lemon,
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling my face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are not into the social
media, and you would like to contact me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you through
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes directly to my phone,
to my iPad, to my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get your email that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would love iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you listen to the podcast on
iTunes, I would love it if you go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of toward the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the little icon with my face on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the middle of the screen,
there's a section that says ratings and
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that, and then go leave me a
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody has left a five-star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave me as many stars as you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it, but if you type in
a comment, let me know what you think of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time to do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that in a few episodes,
so it's coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go sneak a comment in there before I
get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have several emails that I wanna read
here on this episode, but I'm sure you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hear this thing in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna try to clear my throat one
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab, and then I will
be back with an email about auto-fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an email with a nutrient
question, and then we'll see how much time
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got left after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, take a dab while I
do, and I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of some
strawberry banana high cannabinoid full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract from apothecary extracts,
and I am lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit cold a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cold, rainy night, and I am
currently sweating, and I wanna open the
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it sounds like I'm lost for the next
couple of seconds, it's because I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a small child wandering around
the mall wondering where my fucking mom
[SPEAKER_00]: went right now.
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before I took a break and took
a dab that nearly erased my memory,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kinda remember I was teasing about an
email I wanted to read, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the email that is here on my iPad screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna read this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this person wants me to
say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the person that sent this to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sign their name,
but I'm not gonna say it because I respect
[SPEAKER_00]: your privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about your auto flower
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no, your outdoor auto
flower plant is not going to do as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: your outdoor regular photo period plant,
and that's what it's called, is a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period plant, is what I would call it,
a regular or a photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of mainly the reason, the way that
the auto flower plant was bred and
[SPEAKER_00]: designed, it's not meant to get large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to grow to a certain size and
then flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, and let me give a quick
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like regular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten away from feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like regular old school,
regular seeds, male, female, pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds, grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, so the little that I do know about
auto flowers, they're bred to grow to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they get about three feet,
two to three feet, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you're fucking with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could be completely wrong,
but from what I have seen and tried and
[SPEAKER_00]: done, the little experience I've got,
the plant got to about three feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it started flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took it about eight weeks to get to
that height, and then it just started
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering all by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't change the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't change the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it took it about 55 days to
finish flowering, and it was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't satisfied with it,
and I'll never fuck with an auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that they're bred,
there's something in it that triggers it
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower either based on its age or its
height or whatever it decides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start flowering by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not meant to stay alive for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular plant, a photo period plant,
you can grow it as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason a lot of these plants get real
big outdoors is because we start vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: them indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you heard Jesse and I talk about
setting up lights in January and starting
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones in January and getting them
big so that when May comes, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: big four-foot tall plant that's been
topped a couple of times already,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when you put it outside,
it's already four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bigger than your auto flower plant
is even going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quick, straight answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your auto flower plant is not going to get
anywhere near the size of a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you've got, that's what
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But next year, I would recommend working
with regular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get some seeds, grow them
indoors, take some clones off of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: find the keeper, and then put that keeper
outdoors next year is really what you
[SPEAKER_00]: should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got sidetracked, but the reason
that the non-auto flower, the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering photo period plant is able to
get bigger is because you control when it
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg that thing until it's 22 feet
tall if you really wanted to and you had
[SPEAKER_00]: the light and the space to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those auto flower plants, if you're going
to run those, I recommend planting a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of those because they're going to
grow really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't going to have time to get real
big and take up a lot of space,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you plant a whole bunch of them and
fill up your square footage, you'll still
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the amount of cannabis you could
produce from a small personal outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking like a commercial grow or
a big humble county outdoor, but if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a small personal outdoor and you just
pack in that space with auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could produce as much as you could
produce with one or two big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I have never been impressed or
satisfied with the quality of an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that your location
there in Alaska, you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough dark time to get a photo period
plant so the auto flowers are what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it comes out well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love an email update, maybe some
pictures on the progress so that I can see
[SPEAKER_00]: how it goes and we'll talk more about it
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear from you again in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with your auto flower out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email from a
listener and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, I just picked up some of your
Firefly from the dank team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super pumped on getting a few freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes on to list the names of
those freebies that he got from the dank
[SPEAKER_00]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part is I did not name those
that those names are not anything I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not send that to the dank team that
they created those names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have named them what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure what you've got is a lemon
Jeffrey cross to arise and the other seed
[SPEAKER_00]: pack that you've probably got is a cookies
and cream cross to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were some of the freebies that I
sent to the dank team for their orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to know the names that I
decided on or do decide on, send me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know what those strains are
really called if that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also contact the dank team and let
them know to quit naming my shit because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yankee, don't do that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what to name them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to make up names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough ranting about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, here's a question that you may
have covered in a previous podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm a fairly new listener working my
way back through old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're going to love it because I've
been putting out old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes and Stitcher only hold about a
hundred episodes in the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been putting up the old episodes
in chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Thursdays I release long episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like three or four hours long and
they're usually three or four episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the history, the archives,
I'm putting them out in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you get to hear a bunch of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other listeners, let me know what you
think of those long podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a waste of my time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it doing anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I quit doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I keep doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm putting the all the episodes up
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be an archive on YouTube
before too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about 42 of them made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not release them until I've got 50
up there and then you guys will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to keep going with this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm a fairly new listener working
my way back through old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you water with nutrients
every time, every other time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes on to say the guys that
taught me have me water in nutrients every
[SPEAKER_00]: time I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flush one day every other week and
flush at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he explains his setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk a little bit about how much
nutrients and how often to use nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this is going to be based on your
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy here who sent me the email,
he says he's using Botanicare Moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put some, a little bit of perlite
or persilite in that cocoa to give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of aeration would be
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some in the Botanicare
Moisture Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, but I always like to add a
little bit of perlite to my cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes it fluffier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it drain a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants like oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using cocoa, it is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is recommended to water with nutrients
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients do not hang out in the
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically fall right out of the
bottom of the pot with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't catch anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to add nutrients every time
when you're watering with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying you said use the Mills line
with reverse osmosis water, your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, and you've got 12 two gallon
plastic pots per four by four tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got adjust the wing double enders and
CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pulling one and a half to two
pounds of light depending on the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say they look a little fried toward
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be pushing a little too much
nutrient if they look a little fried
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you are probably, since you're using
cocoa, you're probably flushing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: extra long is going to be my assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go back on a couple of things
you said here in the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often should I be using nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time, every other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using cocoa, I recommend using
nutrients every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, the nutrients don't
hang out in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need to replenish that
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in soil or a soil-less
mix, maybe like a peat-based mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, I would only, I would reduce
the frequency of feedings and water with
[SPEAKER_00]: just water maybe every other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's for guys that are using
soil-less mix or soil or living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using living soil, you've
already got your shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to add nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using bottled nutrients,
I would say I feed Botanicare bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I feed, if I'm using Botanicare,
I feed once a week with the Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix the full lineup, whatever I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be base nutrients,
Cal Mag, what else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid Karma, the Hydroplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I add a little bit of Mammoth P to
that, maybe a little Osa 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will feed them all of that shit,
whatever they're getting for the week,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag, whatever they're getting,
whatever root supplement they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get all of that probably Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time they get fed,
they're just going to get plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they need water again that
week, I may give them a tea if it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they get thirsty again,
they'll probably just get water to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: them over until Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually my plants get watered twice a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in seven gallon pots most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only need water twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in your email you said, oh,
let me light up the iPad screen here
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just blacked out on me because I
haven't touched it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said something about flushing that I
want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said the guys that taught you have you
water nutrients every time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that since you're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say you flush one day every other
week and flush at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would skip the flushing one day every
other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not getting to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cleaning out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until you feed with nutrients again,
they are not eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably increase your weight if
you did not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's one more chance they'll get
to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say you flush at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you flush at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: With cocoa, you can get away with 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend 12 to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cocoa, you can totally get away
with 10 days, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watering lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for your situation, I would stop that
flush and I would just feed nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here are a couple of things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can water with nutrients every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a base nutrient every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until recently, I would add all of my
additives like I talked about on Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: and just pummel the plant with everything
on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has encouraged me to do different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll add my base nutrients every time I
water the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Monday, I'll do my Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Tuesday, I'll do Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Wednesday, I'll do Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Thursday, I'll add push.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Friday, I add something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you everything I add
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Friday, I actually add the apatite
from New Millennium is what's been going
[SPEAKER_00]: in there lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just add something different every
day of the week so that that way I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm not overloading the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that's been taught to
me by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying it to see how it works
because I'm open to new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I see great results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do mix several things into the nutrient
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do Veg Bloom base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do Plus Life in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll put some fulvic acid and
we'll put some just a couple other things
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to boost it up like the
Cal Mag and the Epsom salts, that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: only happens once a week and not all in
the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think about that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using cocoa, I would
certainly at least add a base nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a Cal Mag deficiency
with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also in your message, you said at the
end, they look a little bit fried.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be flushing too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're starting to yellow up,
let's just say you're growing on a
[SPEAKER_00]: nine-week cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't tell me about your cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you got a nine-week
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably flushing at the end of
week seven, the start of week eight to
[SPEAKER_00]: give yourself 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming around five to six days,
maybe seven to eight days into that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really start getting yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to turn kind of a goldish
color, maybe a little bit of red in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaves get a little gray on the
tips and they start crinkling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have just cleaned out all the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cocoa doesn't hold anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing sticks to the cocoa like it does
in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just falls right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably just flushed and they're
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you could do is give a little more
nutrients for a little bit longer and that
[SPEAKER_00]: way they won't burn out so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you may get a little more weight,
but there's nothing wrong with too long of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make them taper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using cocoa, you should use
nutrients every time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using soil or a soilless mix,
I would recommend nutrients and then water
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe a tea occasionally just
because that will build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using bottled nutrients in a
soilless mix, the salts will build up
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and then that'll start causing
lockouts and problems and everything will
[SPEAKER_00]: go to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends the email by saying Killer Podcast
and then they sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you want your name set on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually I talked to you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want your real name on the
podcast.
