[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to episode number 45 of the I Grow
Culture podcast, the podcast all about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, a pro grower,
a longtime cannabis consumer, a brand new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker, or just someone who's curious
about the current state of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging out over to my left here is our
good buddy, King Cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I started to choke right as I tried
to introduce you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stumbled there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a big giant dab, and it took
about a minute to kick in, and it happened
[SPEAKER_02]: to be right at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, turn on the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I won't have to yell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the table's Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all red-eyed, and you got drywall
dust in your hair and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like a working man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less video games and more working lately,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're even getting all rough and tumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rough and tumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this is the holiday episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever winter holiday it is that you
celebrate, this will be your episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Merry Holiday, whichever one you
choose to label it as.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter solstice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I support all of your holiday decisions,
whatever religion, race, creed you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a great winter holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you get a lot of gifts if you're
into the gift-giving thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you give a lot of gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you give twice as many gifts as you
receive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bah humbug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not into the holiday thing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we try to change that for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we give you gifts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give your kids some gifts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten gifts that blow my mind in the
past couple of years, but it's always like
[SPEAKER_02]: now I feel obligated because I'm an adult
and that's the proper thing to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I understand that that's not what it
was about, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we just hold you down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bender is a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bender's a great and kind person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bender hooked you up with a fat gift and
now you feel fucked because you can't... I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that are able to give out kind
gifts like that to our friends that we
[SPEAKER_02]: know can't give a gift like that,
we do it because we know that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit and that you deserve it,
and we don't expect anything in return.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to fucking play with that.
Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to throw that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Bender gave Adam, can I say
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave you a video card, a graphics card
for your computer, and you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to see you smiling and all
shitted and giggled when you're playing
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, and that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't about you giving him back a gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely, and thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so cheer up and fucking enjoy the
holidays with us or we'll hold you down
[SPEAKER_02]: and tickle you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try with the kids, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that going to make you feel when two
grown men hold you down and tickle you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been tickled as a grown man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not since I left Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: This just took an awkward turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to put it back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned it's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes sent me an email and they say that
there will be a delay in podcast posting
[SPEAKER_02]: between December 22nd and January 5th,
which will affect this episode and
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will post them early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're recording on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show comes out on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to put it up like Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, that'll give iTunes time to do
whatever it is they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why they choose to do that
around Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can love it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it makes it, it may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to remind you guys,
we're going to change the name of the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, I said December 1st,
but I was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant January 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start calling it the Grow
From Your Heart podcast because iGrow is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a horticulture agricultural
educational institution that does not want
[SPEAKER_02]: me associating their name with our beloved
sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they send me a cease and desist
letter, I'm just going to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: switch it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the responsible thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to rip off anybody else's
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody else was called iGrow culture,
I'd be pissed off about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they were called iReGenetics,
I'd be double pissed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to be fair?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very noble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to move your mic closer to you,
but you've got that beautiful hitman rig
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of you that you grabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get that at the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't write down any space for you to
ramble about the Emerald Cup, but do you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to tell us about your experience for
a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emerald Cup was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd highly recommend all growers to try to
make it out to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best cup I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as tongue in cheek as the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stereotypical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So less of an RV show and more of a
growers kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in Santa Rosa, California,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you flew out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hang out with Baca a lot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and him went out there together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's never gotten a shout out on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, James?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sending you some love, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope we get to dab sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a very busy guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the growers are hard to get in one
room together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like we went to Cali and it's
like for four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds great, but four days for
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an eternity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still trying to recover from that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that third day you're like going,
I wonder if everything's alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder, when the flight, you're like,
I just want to, can you just fly over my
[SPEAKER_02]: house?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to, come on, I want to see if
it burned down or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're always got the worst
ideas in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, you've been working a lot,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you working on, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some grow up buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a... Is it the one that we talked
about last?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the whole Denver Bud Company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver Bud Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are still putting that together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many lights are going in
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: More a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say 55 to 75 per unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to give exact units,
but it's still single digit units.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing there and the guy that
was there doing it was there all alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I don't know if you've ever
tried to do construction all alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really do a lot of construction
by yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just slow cutting and doing and
cutting and doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Measure twice, cut once, nail it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Measure twice, cut once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you need someone to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier if you got someone to help you
hold the shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When he told me, I literally laughed at
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, you know, it's good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't bitch and hopefully it holds out
through the end of the month because I
[SPEAKER_02]: really needed the stuff for the kids and
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's good timing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good Christmas check.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of busy today myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, today I want to give a big shout out
to my homie, Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence and I have been talking about me
learning how to make dabs because I smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of hash and I grow my own herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am sufficient all the way from,
I can create my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can germinate and I can grow the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got the product that is done as
flowers and trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to smoke dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to learn how to turn that into
the dabs I want today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence spent about four or five hours
teaching me how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran a couple of batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to run some tubes myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all the way up to the point when
we put it in the vac oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand the vac oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know the controls on the oven
very well myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I get that comfortable, I think I can
make pretty good quality shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a batch of my shatter that I
blasted sitting in the vac oven right now
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for me to check it out in about 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence is going to flip it because it's in
his facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm kind of proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll go from seed to shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go all the way from the germination
all the way to my dabber now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about congrats yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched and tried once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an experimental process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just trying to learn something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting out of the comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really, I was comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized I was comfortable for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had irie genetics go and I haven't
done anything for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, I've expanded and learned and
grown, but now I've got this new grow
[SPEAKER_02]: facility with 227 lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm learning how to make hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely getting out of the comfort
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's more comfortable than just
blasting a QP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if I can make hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw down three ounces of your favorite
lemon Jeffrey and just run it and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My forearms are a little, uh, there's a
lot of work involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as easy as you might think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, speaking of me making dabs,
uh, this podcast is brought to you by our
[SPEAKER_02]: good friends at highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using high quality concentrates
made by Rasta Jeff or garden of Weeden,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even this water hash, uh, solvent list,
what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Full melt hash that Sean made and brought
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is tasty and dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: You deserve a high quality titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's made right here in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made in Provo, Utah by our good
friend Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trust a cheap Chinese nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trust an American knockoff made of
cheap crappy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust the industry leader, the innovator,
the Kings, trust our good friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out highlyeducatedti
.com for more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to buy yourself a highly
educated product, or if you want to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else, a highly educated titanium
gift, you should head to
[SPEAKER_02]: Aqualabtechnologies.com right now and
place your order and get that Christmas
[SPEAKER_02]: gift in for your favorite dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think every dabber would like a brand
new titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they've got a nail that'll fit your 14
and your 18 millimeter rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got one will fit your 10,
uh, your 11 and your 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a carb cap to go with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would make anybody at this
table pretty happy if you got a nail and a
[SPEAKER_02]: carb cap in the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See everybody looked at me like,
you know, I don't have one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got cool colors now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have cool colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean's is kind of, is that purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you call that pink?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right here is a purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yours is pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's pink though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got a blue one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm spoiled guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got multiple colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it go by your lady, a pink?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're manly as fuck for carrying that
pink one around with pride and a pink
[SPEAKER_02]: torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's dick must be huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of big dicks, make sure you check
out highlyeducatedtitanium.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I also want to give a big thanks to
Adams right in front of me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You helped me out a whole fucking bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You helped me transplant a large number of
plants and it took us hours and I
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our fingernails real dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made these guys listen to reggae and
then we got tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and something really weird happened at
the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I blasted Pantera as loud as it would
freaking go for a good album worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really out of character for me,
but it got us pumped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were a little bit getting burned out
and that Pantera really got the mosh pit
[SPEAKER_02]: in the room going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the point where there's like,
where's the rest of the work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no more work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys knocked it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So huge thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took the three of us most of the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine watching me try to do that
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've said, it's a learning process for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to do a couple quick ads and
then we'll keep this going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to keep the momentum going in
the conversation.

[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of seeds I've given people,
huge shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's growing an experimental strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, uh, the Girl Scout cookies
crossed to the King Ken Grape Stomper OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she killed it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Maddie got her own little grow space
over at the Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she put some of my seeds in there and
they look freaking marvelous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good job, Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet them, uh, the other weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it was a pleasure to meet
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to smell finally some of the stuff
that I've been looking at Instagram for
[SPEAKER_02]: the past three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you want to give Jesse a shout out
for a day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, you know, thank you for letting me
and my wife get out of the house for a
[SPEAKER_02]: change and, you know, putting me to work
so I can pay some bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanksgiving though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He invited you to dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got everybody blazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicated food.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I was able to go, it was
wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanksgaving was what the phrase was by
the time I wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't giving anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Jesse, this podcast is brought
to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.

they don't need and then try to sell you
[SPEAKER_02]: that.

and say, you guys don't have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll go, we didn't know you wanted
it.

but once I get it, they'll have it back.

Supplies, make sure you tell them you

discount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do one more ad because I got
a lot of cool stuff to say to Sean and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's sitting here patiently twiddling his
carb cap like he wants to hear the
[SPEAKER_02]: questions I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a dab while you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, do a dab while he does a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a little dab right here and
I can just ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I try the live resume?
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's alive right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook Adam up with one after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got it all taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at treethugger.com, treethugger
[SPEAKER_02]: .com, live music lifestyle magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews, www.treethugger
[SPEAKER_02]: .com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go see the string cheese
incident on New Year's Eve for all three
[SPEAKER_02]: nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guarantee there will be some shit
about that on treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't write it, but I know that that
shit will be up there because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hippies will like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, you can put the rig by the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody minds hearing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes them feel like they're there with
us listening to your torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm going to read part of an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the commercials, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're fast forwarding through
commercials, you could stop right now and
[SPEAKER_02]: just listen to this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to find my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of notes on my phone that
I want to make sure I read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got something for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on the forums the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like you're getting more response
on the forums as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not dramatic, but when I logged in,
there was only X amount of users,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now there's a little bit more than
double.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've been pulled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say just a little because every
one of those people I'm fucking grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't say there's only 63.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say there are fucking 63, yay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making up a number, but I'm excited
for each one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about the iRegenetics
Colorado webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post a lot of stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been there for a week because I
got this new job, and I've been scrambling
[SPEAKER_02]: to get a whole bunch of shit done before I
start there, but trust me, I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on that website sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to our good
friend, Jake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jake sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't read the whole thing because of
some of the stuff that he says.
[SPEAKER_02]: He asked me not to say some stuff that he
wrote, but he ends this with, congrats on
[SPEAKER_02]: the new job and keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing your part in making my
12-hour shift bearable.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, I am grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the compliments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of stuff right there makes the
hours that I put into this show worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes these guys come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean puts part of his day aside to come
here and hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam has to break away from his family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse's got a construction company,
a grow business, a hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have to break away from their
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing these compliments really lets us
know that you're loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it worth it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd do it even if he didn't, but really
it's like, yay, someone's listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Jake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome that you did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say the rest of your message
because you said some cool stuff that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got more stuff written down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to talk some news real quick
or do you want me to ask Sean questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean will have an opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give Sean some room to
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's patient and quiet over there,
nice and polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: In local news, I hope you guys have an
opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really cannabis related,
but the Westboro Baptist Church is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: to our town to pick it at our courthouse
and at two local dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming here because our town
supports gay rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a gay woman who is one of our
representatives and she's a cool ass lady
[SPEAKER_02]: and I support her in every way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Westboro Baptist Church wants to come
here and protest us because we have gay
[SPEAKER_02]: rights here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once they're done protesting at our
courthouse, they're going to go to two
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries and protest over there in
Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm flattered you guys are coming,
but fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are our own town.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go worry about your own damn town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, no matter what religion you
are, no matter what you believe in,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think be kind and love everybody is what
you're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being very hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not being kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not loving anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're preaching hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're driving from Kansas to come to
Colorado to show how angry they are at us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize they were that close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you have some shit to do at home?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be presumptuous.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, but I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that while mom and dad are
here protesting that little Jimmy's
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking a joint in Kansas and little
Sarah's getting butt fucked by Jimmy's
[SPEAKER_02]: older brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not much weirder shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's Kansas, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The brother and sister are just getting it
in the living room while the parents are
[SPEAKER_02]: here protesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen their children that they have
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope their kids are getting gay and
smoking weed while they're here
[SPEAKER_02]: protesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching Duck Dynasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching Duck Dynasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching porn, getting gay, smoking weed,
drinking 40s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wearing camo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying the N word, but not in a racial
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calling each other the N word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's what your kids are doing
while you're here protesting our town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as you get home, it's back to
the polo shirts and yes, mama,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I truly am flattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of places for them to go
and they chose here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have gay rights and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just figured they'd run it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're running out of places to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be offensive to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the West.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even say the name of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bother me so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this one group.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just piss me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've said a lot of rude shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wanted to know the name of the
dispensary side.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to Marisol is the first one
they listed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I took a screenshot of the article
here because that's how I was just saving
[SPEAKER_02]: news on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't take a screenshot of the
article, but I know they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: Marisol and one other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you said the name of it,
it may be Pueblo West organics actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was not the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the spot that I would represent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where the good weed is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our local news.
[SPEAKER_02]: In bigger news, Colorado is being sued by,
I'm looking for the article on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is being sued by the states of
Nebraska and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard about this yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean's lighting a joint over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks like he's ready for this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, the states of Nebraska and Oklahoma
announced that they have filed lawsuits
[SPEAKER_02]: against Colorado alleging that Colorado's
amendment 64 is unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's attorney general, John Suthers
issued the following statement in
[SPEAKER_02]: response, because neighboring states have
expressed concern about Colorado grown
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana coming into their states.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not entirely surprised by this
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it appears the plaintiff's
primary grievance stems from a non
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement of federal laws regarding
marijuana, as opposed to choices made by
[SPEAKER_02]: the others of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe this suit is without merit and
we will vigorously defend it against it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the US Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nebraska and Oklahoma are trying to sue
Colorado because we are not following
[SPEAKER_02]: federal rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to try to force the feds to
come in here and clean up the weed scene
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're jelly all that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they're jelly?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think, but those aren't states
that... They're not very popular in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're really worried about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are places that pretty much lock you
up forever for having herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like it at all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's happening because I know
people, we read about them getting busted
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are definitely driving pounds and
pounds out of this state because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to produce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you really think it was any more
than before?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll win more personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you here for the wild, wild west
revolution that I talk about when
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody got a red card and there was
nobody to care to regulate it and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody just grew?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first got here, or at least when I
first got here, there wasn't the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: badge system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could walk into your shop with a
backpack full of quarter pounds and sell
[SPEAKER_02]: them to you, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you were getting... Here it was
seven to eight, maybe nine, if you could
[SPEAKER_02]: really hustle the shop for a quarter
pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know friends that will maybe send
shit to the East coast and they can get 15
[SPEAKER_02]: for that same quarter pound to their
cousin or their brother that lives out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and they just don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll just send it or drive it out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a 20 something year old kid
with no kids, what's to stop you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my point of view is just the
weeds, it's either going to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: California, it's going to come from
Washington, or it's going to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like the weeds just going to be
moving across those states anyways,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of whether they sue us,
it'll just go right back to wherever they
[SPEAKER_01]: were getting it from before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the solution would just be
nationwide legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine without borders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just started a new program,
Medicine Without Borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just make it known and we'll just
drive around your fucking city.
[SPEAKER_01]: State.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about giving it to
convicts and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spin your mic a little towards your face,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about giving it to
convicts as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hear how rich you sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you sound like you're up in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, they're talking about giving
it to convicts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might've taken a lot of dabs before
this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that would help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Convicts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in jail, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that what you saw was on the onion
and I don't think that that was real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christy pointed it out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consider you're a source, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't read a source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of fucking internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he could be right, but I'm pretty
sure... Well, all I know is that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a little bit of time and weed makes
it all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it not so annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The loudness and the... Well, that's why
weed cures depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps with depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes things that suck not as... Oh
yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people that have to work at
Taco Bell all day get fucking blazed right
[SPEAKER_02]: before they go to Taco Bell all day when
you try to order your food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to go off onto the ramp.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy at Subway the other day was way
higher than we were and that's saying
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a time and place for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I saved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, it's refreshing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might not have internet service on
computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that happens, then we're making a 45
minute video on how bad it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: How bad the internet sucks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, it's coming back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's not another internet
company, is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we don't get an option in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get one provider.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a little less anxiety for medical
marijuana states on a federal level is the
[SPEAKER_02]: next article here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from The Cannabis and it's published
December 12th and it's from Kyle Potter of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, buried deep inside the 1,600
page funding bill, Congress is scrambling
[SPEAKER_02]: to pass to avert a shutdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few lines can... Sorry, let me try that
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few lines comforted Minnesota officials
worried about the federal government
[SPEAKER_02]: cracking down on the state's new medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of skim a little bit
here because I want to get to more of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to read this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: In its current form, the $1.1 trillion
spending bill includes a section that bans
[SPEAKER_02]: the Department of Justice from using
federal funds to intervene with states
[SPEAKER_02]: with medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best part right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can almost stop the whole article right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what that says is... I'm going to read
it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: In its current form, the $1.1 trillion
spending bill, wrap your head around that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking number real quick, $1.1 trillion,
but then it says, bans the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice from using federal funds to
intervene in states with medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: laws, which means they can't fuck with us
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they can because they'll find a
way, but they're not going to mess with
[SPEAKER_02]: the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to try to come and make
us switch our laws back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're going to continue
with raids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still going to be illegal
grow-ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still going to be illegal stuff
going on that they're going to have to...
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, 23 states have legalized medical
marijuana, but those measures still
[SPEAKER_02]: conflict with federal law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And though the Obama administration has
generally been friendlier to marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: than administrations past, Munson Regala
wondered what if that changes or a new
[SPEAKER_02]: president changes course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The US House narrowly passed the funding
bill with the medical marijuana section
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Senate was expected to take it up
Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he doubts the bill will markedly
change the government's handling of the
[SPEAKER_02]: issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most attorneys have indicated they won't
go after medical marijuana businesses as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as they're following state laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the point is, I think it gives them a
little more comfort and I wouldn't say it
[SPEAKER_02]: gives very much more comfort, but you
never know, he continued.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom line is, it's still illegal
under federal law, so anything could
[SPEAKER_02]: happen, but they don't have funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: These cops aren't going to go and raid
shit on their own time, are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cop in California that did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, then you're also... If a cop's
going to go off and do that on his own
[SPEAKER_02]: time without support, he may be looking
for that lucrative income.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not going to fly in Colorado
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, but I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like to me it's going to lead to
bad to cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we've gone like 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some talk about this
organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that I got through all
the important part, paid all the bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm caught up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got notes and shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like almost a real show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 50 is coming up and I'm getting
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to think about what we can
give away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Jesse, if you're listening,
dude, remember you guys kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: volunteered to give some shit away on
number 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're going to say something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been kind of like trying to figure
out what to give away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he's been bouncing things off me and
I've been bouncing things off him and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweet us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are listening, tweet me at
iGrowCulture or email me iGrowCulture at
[SPEAKER_02]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know what you want for giveaway
prizes and we'll see if we can accommodate
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Sean's here, the guy that talked a
whole bunch about cool organic shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingcola, you guys loved that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drying and Curing and that organics
episode have been my two most popular
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes out of 44 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People asked a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't shout out everybody that emailed
me, texted me, tweeted me because I would
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a whole show doing it, but we got a
lot of response on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk more about worm castings
mostly because that's kind of what seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the base of a lot of your stuff and
a lot of what got the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, for our basic tea, you said
worm castings and molasses, and you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned multiplying the protozoa is
something that you really stressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, first of all, I guess my main question
I should ask is what are protozoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Protozoa are just other microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of the microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you've got fungi and bacteria and all
of these beneficial things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you're just going to give them a food
source and really give them a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive and grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all of those things actually fall
under the category of protozoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The protozoa are a specific... I don't
know what... I can't think the term right
[SPEAKER_01]: off of my head, but yeah, it's just a
certain microbe that lives in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that I'd never really... I'd
seen the word, but I never paid attention
[SPEAKER_02]: until you opened my mind to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I had a... So, since we're on
the subject, we have been feeding our
[SPEAKER_01]: worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been substituting alfalfa with
cannabis.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were donated a little over 3,000 pounds
of what we call Cannamil, which is finely
[SPEAKER_01]: ground material from a local... Actually,
I can open vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell vapor pens and organolabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They donated the material by law.
[SPEAKER_01]: By state law, all dispensaries have to
dispose of their waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, a lot of people are
just mixing it with old dirt and throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a dumpster and then it's going to a
landfill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been feeding it to our worms,
kind of as a test trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got our test results back today,
actually, and it was off the chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really was... Let's see what we
had on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's searching, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's digging through the iPhone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
has definitely been the conversation at
[SPEAKER_02]: work for most of the week, anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really takes pride in what he does and
he feeds his worms the highest quality
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be the important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes them produce what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's so focused on cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants the cheapest casting out
there and they don't really understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're only hurting yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want... Well, I keep saying if
you're going to cut costs on the growth
[SPEAKER_02]: and cut the cost on the sale too,
and they don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to cut cost in one end and it's
not fair.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with these castings, you can take a
compost and cut 10 to 15% of the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and then make your own vermicompost and
then cut that in one part peat moss,
[SPEAKER_01]: one part aeration, one part vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your base soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add in your amendments like your
crab meal and your azomite and kelp and
[SPEAKER_01]: alfalfa, whatever you're going to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your mixed soil and it's really
that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jay's been feeding his worms cannabis
plant matter and they have been freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test results were astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comparably to running the alfalfa,
the biological life was off the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we gained hundreds of protozoa,
fungi, bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The active fungi, which means basically
the things that are working in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we had a higher fungal content,
but that doesn't really mean much if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not active.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lower fungal content,
but more activity if that makes more
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you want more bio life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff is so freaking biodiverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feeding it cannabis made it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're going to feed that to your
cannabis and then feed those leaves back
[SPEAKER_02]: to those worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely closed loop growing system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A closed loop, self-sustainable system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all got to get away from the
bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been reading more about it since Sean
kind of talked about it and we're paying
[SPEAKER_02]: for shipping and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're paying a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the general organics
label today, just kind of going over what
[SPEAKER_01]: was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just so much stuff in the
label and there's really not that much in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to preserve it and they got to
make it stable and it's got to be chelated
[SPEAKER_02]: or buffered or yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's got to be shipped and it's got
to be able to stay in different
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures and it's got to have a shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just make it yourself 24 hours
before you use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell it and it's so much richer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're not throwing away plastic
for all the neighbors to see your freaking
[SPEAKER_02]: botanic air bottles in the trash can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you talked about multiplying the
protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to go about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you just need to give them a
food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you mix your tea up, so basically
what you're going to do is you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: add in your worm castings and then you're
going to put in your food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to back up just for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a nylon or something to keep all the
stuff in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I preach free suspension teas,
especially on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're not doing anything over
15 or 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw all the shit right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw it right in there and then stir
it up and it's like top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on kind of thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to bubble it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get your hopefully reverse osmosis
water or at least let it bubble for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the air out and then put all your worm
castings, your molasses and whatever else
[SPEAKER_02]: you decide to put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can expand on it as you please.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked about a lot of cool shit to put
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get your bucket, you get your air
stones, castings and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to throw that in there and
you're going to just want to brew it from
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wouldn't recommend taking
anything over that if you're not familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set it on something, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to bubble up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's going to bubble up huge and
make a huge bubbly mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have a big problem with the
foam, it's as simple as dropping a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of coconut oil in there and then it's
just gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've made plenty of mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to grow in carpet and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some of your pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just want to feed them and put them
in a bucket and give them some oxygen and
[SPEAKER_02]: they will multiply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the ratio they multiply?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to give them like 10,000
times?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a thousand times more?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get thousands and
thousands of times more.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out anybody who's listening that's
interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google Microban and he's got amazing
articles about brew times and how you can
[SPEAKER_01]: take them longer for more fungal dominant
teas, shorter times for more bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant teas, how you can actually kind
of cook or inoculate your ingredients for
[SPEAKER_01]: your compost tea to make them more fungal
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take your earthworm castings
and sprinkle in a little bit of oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say that you're going to use
three cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, I mixed a 15 gallon tea
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used three and three quarters cups of
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew I was going to use that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did is I took that three and
three quarters cup of worm castings and
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in a mason jar, added some oat
bran, sprayed it with a water bottle and
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed it up about two days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then today I went down into my
basement and cracked it open and it
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was covered in white.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see no bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use that for my tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a way to fungal charge the shit
out of your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis plants love fungal dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's going to make, instead of
those little scraggly shitty roots you
[SPEAKER_02]: see, it's going to make big, thick white
spaghetti for roots, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, you know, with the,
when you do the free suspension teas and
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of get messy, your drip trays
will fill up with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how it gets at the end of the
grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen my roots will grow right
into that dirt in the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they just can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely, I need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the stores in Colorado Springs,
I live about 45 minutes away from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to plan a trip up there quite
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hear within the next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some freshly transplanted stuff
that I want to feed some Rocky Mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: worm tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep talking about azomite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want, I've always thought of azomite
as something I wanted to add during
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want that in my veg phase as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, really it's just more for
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to mix it in with your
soil, which most people will do,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they'll have some sort of amendment
similar in their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really wouldn't recommend it until
you're flowering, especially if you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not transplanting really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These, these plants I'm doing now are
going to finish in their little pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the azomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people who will do a worm
castings, grow kashi and azomite every two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks as a top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to learn more about the kashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's all grow kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow kashi is really cool,
but I feel like a lot of people are using
[SPEAKER_01]: it just to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they really understand
what they're using it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is that it's lactic acid
bacteria, it's photosynthetic bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of other things going on in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to introduce that into
your root zone, into your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grow kashi will actually help
digest old root parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mats and things that are sitting in
your soil kind of stagnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of like enzymes would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like enzymes would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can show you how to kick that
bottle of hygrozyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as sprouting some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there's something else I'm going to
learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take me a little bit of
time, but eventually I'm going to get away
[SPEAKER_02]: from all the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because I taught Adam how to
grow mostly with full bottled stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's over there shaking his head like,
I have to read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the seed process the other day and
it just clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I compare it to cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you first start cooking and you look
at recipes online and stuff, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking overwhelming because there's so
many things that go into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once your cabinet's filled with all
those spices, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes five minutes to whip up a meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with the tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overwhelming at first, but once you
have castings and molasses and kelp and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroslate and everything that you use,
it's really nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're buying all those things in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting them at a fraction of
the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without water weight for shipping too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can buy everything locally between
Jesse at Hygro and then Jay up at Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mount Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's absolutely no reason to buy
anything online.
[SPEAKER_02]: When's a good time for me to drop in,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Midday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about my style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday through Friday, midday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do things too damn early.
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 to 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lunchtime is when I do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to stop up there and check out
these Kana castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty freaking sweet,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be up there really soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go get some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sparked so many questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure which one to pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll choose one from a listener.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to grab my phone again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm the wrong person in this
damn chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if Jesse was here right now,
he would have been all in this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just sitting over here with my
mouth open.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hearing about this because I see it
around in all the growing footage and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of my show is to bring the growers on
your level and the growers on his level
[SPEAKER_02]: into one together because we're not
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were playing guitar or being a
skateboarder or you probably play Xbox way
[SPEAKER_02]: better than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might MMA fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing weed while you were doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll help you grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully when I want to learn how to MMA
fight or some shit, you're down to teach
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live back East.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nobody that was willing to teach
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched all the YouTube videos for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now being able to see it firsthand and
being able to have different styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I let you trim the first time,
I thought you had a boner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did until the dog and then it was like,
it got really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I gave him that grateful dog,
he went nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff stunk so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that doesn't really affect the
podcast here because I'm getting a phone
[SPEAKER_02]: call and it's popping up on my computer
because the new iOS, no, it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new iOS 8 likes to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude, I like having you on because you
don't have to be a pro to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might ask the one question that the
listeners are wondering because Sean and I
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of know what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been told that we're snobs and we
just talk right over some points because
[SPEAKER_02]: we expect everyone to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wears off really well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go home and she'll have like,
oh, this so-and-so gave us some bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you've seen some things,
we've kind of opened Adam's eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Adam first moved here, he would have
smoked anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have smoked anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that guy that cleans out your
ashtray and smokes the stuff out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: ashtray?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would totally be Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam will do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is a Facebook comment from
our good buddy Fred, Fred Garvin,
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred likes to comment and I appreciate it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one says, ha ha, shout out Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, episode 44 was rocking, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught that tease about the next episode
and MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know nothing about it except Cushman
yammering on about it being bad on a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple other podcasts, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in my can of A and B cocoa?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it is bad, what synthetic newt line
should I, should I slash we be looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, keep the shows coming and stay
frosty, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I want to say,
dude, thanks for freaking sending us
[SPEAKER_02]: messages, uh, participating and thank and
thanking us for what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really weird echo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you catch that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something went digital on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's back though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a question for Sean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So MAP and DAP is, uh, let's see if I can
say this right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mono ammonium phosphate and dio
potassium phosphate or something similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but basically they're, uh,
they're chemicals that are used in
[SPEAKER_01]: basically every single hydro product or
synthetic nutrient product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're synthetic salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the big problem with them,
uh, in my opinion is they don't flush out
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I don't think that you can
get them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, heavy metals and things like that are
stored in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you kind of get them in there,
there's no way to get them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're blasting, you're blasting
those heavy metals into your mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a, you know, I kind of
mentioned azomite a couple of times and
[SPEAKER_01]: azomite is one of the things that's filled
with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to be liberal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't want to use too much
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, glacial rock dust filled with heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just, uh, synthetics,
you know, that are filled with these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but mono MAP and DAP are probably
the worst of all, uh, just in the simple
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that they're the most common and it's
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something easy to look out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not telling you to like run away
from the MAP and DAP, but it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're somebody who's interested in a
cleaner product, something that's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more organic, uh, the, you know,
you need to become familiar with the terms
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to look out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're looking for a nice
organic problem, product, look for
[SPEAKER_01]: something with like a soybean meal or kelp
or alfalfa or brewer's yeast or soul
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics offers stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul synthetics is a killer line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biobiz is especially if he's running Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're running Kana,
then you know, Biobiz is an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very similar style of growing,
uh, really high quality stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or grown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if everybody probably follows
that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He straight crushes it all Biobiz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know if he really talks about
what he uses, but a lot of us don't talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it on the, on the Instagram feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call him out because he's got
amazing shit and he's using organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: he deserves to be called out on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using organics and getting good
progress, that's deserved to be noted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the Biobiz is a really good one
to use, uh, general organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, that's another one to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good, but you know,
to each his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's what's the big one on the market
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother of all blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know what Moab is,
is just map.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the ingredients,
it's like 99.9% map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to sit here and tell you
that it's like going to kill you or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bad for you, but it's one of the things
you want to look out for if you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just printed on the bottle as mono
ammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're looking for it, that's map
and DAP is the Dio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trying to avoid that,
that those are the two to, to stray from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I know I'm just parroting what
Cushman says, but Cushman says that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: often what gives you, when you smoke good
weed and for some reason you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: headache and you're like, but that was
good herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did it give me a headache?
[SPEAKER_02]: It had map and DAP residuals in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't prove that, but that's what
Cushman has led me to believe from
[SPEAKER_02]: everything he has said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mostly trust Cushman.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason not to trust Cushman in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's a, he's the, he's kicking ass and
taking names with his veganics right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's won a couple of cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he really knows what the plant wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take his word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you recycle your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I ask you that in the last episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't like to recycle my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it because it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I recycle my soil, I like to use it as
a, in my veggie garden, but I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't mastered that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see a loss in yield no matter
what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've blamed it on other things and haven't
attributed it to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that these worm castings are
going to help me out, fix that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm having better luck starting with
sterile medias.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I used to run like happy frog
and roots and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switched it up to more of like a pro mix
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot better results out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm running my own like vermicompost,
peat moss and buckwheat hole with
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pro mix and stuff, I'm getting
better results with reusing the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier to amend it at the
beginning of being a sterile media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can write down how much of what I put
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically if my plant doesn't show a
deficiency throughout that cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remend everything like I would,
you know, a brand new soil mix and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: right back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, running the Fox farm
and the roots organic, I feel like with
[SPEAKER_01]: the guanos and the blood meals and
everything that's already in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: plus me amending it by the end of the
cycle, sure that might not have been of
[SPEAKER_01]: any deficiencies, but I really don't know
where that soil's at.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where I'm at with
reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of what I found to do
with, I've been doing with my soil lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take it and mix it with the stuff out
of my Bukashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of the slimy leftover pickled
trash that ends up in your Bukashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just mix it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're making him hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that shit, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just dump it out into your,
you know, into like a Rubbermaid container
[SPEAKER_01]: and fill it up with dirt and then just let
it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically, you know, in a couple
of weeks or a month or two or whenever I
[SPEAKER_01]: get around to going back to those buckets,
it'll be compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll mix that with worm castings
and use that as a vermicompost for my
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're using up a lot of space,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just picture a lot of space when I'm
thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a garage and I don't park my car in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'm storing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do crazy shit so other people don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any like weird experiments you
want to try and you don't have the space,
[SPEAKER_01]: just email Jeff and he'll let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also have a friend in California who
wants your bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a plant with bugs,
he wants you to clip off a leaf of that or
[SPEAKER_02]: a branch of that plant and send it to him
so that he can play with the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treetown.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treetown Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a guy at the cup who does something
similar with microscopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been through a couple of Elaine
Ingram courses and he's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get them looked at.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to find your niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's a good little transplanter and
grunt worker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does some shit in the gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just worked to get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked in the room and him and this
other dude had dirt flying three feet in
[SPEAKER_02]: the air and all of it was landing into
pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Mike knew what to think
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you definitely work at a different
pace than what Mike's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He picked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He picked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should I not use in my organics?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be my last question for
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on your level of your
dedication to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that I would kick out
would be blood meal and bone meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really care about organics,
chances are you don't eat GMOs and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't eat ... I'm not going to say you're
a vegetarian if you're into organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but those things are byproducts of
the slaughterhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feather meal is a byproduct of the poultry
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong because I'd rather than
be recycled into agricultural byproducts
[SPEAKER_01]: for farm and other agricultural uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to growing medicine for
people, I don't believe that feather meal
[SPEAKER_01]: made from chickens that were fed
antibiotics and hormones should be used to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the blood that's scraped
off the slaughterhouse floor to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just this gelatinous goo filled with
everything that was in that cow bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use things like that,
I would just recommend ... There's other
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use things like fish blood meal,
alfalfa, kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of plant baits.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to get into it,
comfrey and burdock root and nettle and
[SPEAKER_01]: dandelions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go out in the woods and pick a bunch of
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I going to come back from the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company with a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: backseat full of brand new shit and
rethink my whole growing method the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time I go in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing is you'll probably see a
couple of things that you've seen at
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's shop too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see those, it might click with
you and be like, well, maybe I should pick
[SPEAKER_01]: those up next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to ... If you're going to be
going up to Jay's, check out the C-Crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little secret product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I use in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted by Jay a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're the second one to tell me
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our buddy Spence had some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might have picked it or Jay might have
given him some of it or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I use it to basically replace my full
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody out there is familiar with full
power or fulvic acid or humic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it and replace it in place of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you'll be there when I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the fun go ... Oh yeah, just give me
a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be up there.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure when I'm going yet,
but- I'm always looking for an excuse to
[SPEAKER_01]: get up to the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go find one more gift for the
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to sneak away while she's at work
and sneak up there and get some worm
[SPEAKER_02]: casting worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more gift for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of gifts, if you guys want to get
a cool gift for somebody, come and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: Bukashi bucket, home worm farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I need one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ship it to Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Help your grower be more self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come by Rocky Mountain Worm Company and
hook you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They listened to the podcast because they
said they liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, I'm going to come get some worm
castings and we should talk about some
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsorship sort of stuff because people
seem to be responding to you and I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: support semi-local shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Pueblo, but I still love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll brag about worm castings and you
supply me with worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they might be more than happy to
work with you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're big fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love your shit.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're doing a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to get in there and learn
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we've got 53 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start closing up the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to have you back on more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what you ... We get sidetracked
because we're potheads, but I like having
[SPEAKER_02]: you on and you have a lot of useful shit
to share with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send anybody who has any questions,
send them to Jeff and get them to send
[SPEAKER_01]: them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have them ready next time and we'll
just slam through them, but I'm fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took solventless dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took the live resin dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took shattered dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam looks dabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just tired as fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This delicious Yerba mate is keeping me
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the mate factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to Sweet Angela for
getting me addicted to the Yerba mate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, babe, but Jesus, mate,
I don't know what you've done to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've created a monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mate is so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best idea we had though was buying
bags to bring it home and make it so now
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have to drive to our favorite
mate spot in Manitou Springs every time we
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mate because we would do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's a great excuse to get up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The place is freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more comfortable in Manitou Springs
than I am here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to get bad here,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of, yeah, it's a little
gangster here, but I feel like I have more
[SPEAKER_02]: friends that are more open to go do shit
in Manitou.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to go out of their house here
because it's weird here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to really go have fun at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go walk in Manitou.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just go walk and enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody got any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody you want to say you love to?
[SPEAKER_02]: You love anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that, you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a boy's birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a boy's birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, little miniature Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen pictures of him on Facebook
riding a skateboard and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be just like you when he
grows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got him a Genesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to my girl
Kelly for holding it down while I was in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took care of the grow and kept the
plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know she was pissed that I left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love you, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly trying to talk my wife into
just learning that, the ability to take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk in there and go, why is
everything all droopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: They take in a lot more than they let on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought that my girl could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But given the chance, she could probably
make a tea better than most.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Queen Cola?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long time since I've seen you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to take dabs together over at
Maddie's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're smiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job on holding down the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give a shout out to my chick if
we're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My chick knows her way around the garden,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I need anything done, she can
definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here goes my phone again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I just mentioned her and she started
calling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Rumpelstiltskin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, you shouted out the boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Bender, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Running the servers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Running the servers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You paid my bills, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't work, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm there busting my butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phone ringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
