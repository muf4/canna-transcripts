[SPEAKER_00]: This is Doug Benson, and you're listening
to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 395 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of gelato
cake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from our friends at Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 62.2% THC and 73.4%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really unique, funky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find the right words to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gross, it is funky, and it is sweet,
spicy, and sour, and delicious all at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't get enough of the gelato
cake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is incredible, and the buzz is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me nice and high, and it's got my
eyes kind of droopy, and I've got the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton mouth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, big shout out to all my friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great gelato cake
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following along,
you know that I've been doing a long
[SPEAKER_00]: series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I mentioned that
those lessons were over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, I realized I left out a
very crucial part of our grow experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off by making a solid plan for
our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought out our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought out our space very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought out our genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we successfully ran a full
garden cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have dried and cured that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some beautifully trimmed up
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the one thing I left out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We never smoked this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this episode is going to be the smoke
that shit episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've ran a full garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's reward ourselves and enjoy our
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really nothing like smoking your
own product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any flowers that you've grown,
harvested, trimmed, you spend a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really got some attachment to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really a rewarding feeling that
comes with smoking a crop that you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown many, many small personal
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown many large commercial crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a lot of pheno hunts of plants
that I have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown a lot of plants, and it is
still very exciting to me to get to try
[SPEAKER_00]: the first little batch of smoke from each
crop that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something very rewarding,
and very satisfying, and very fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like a kid inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a kid on Christmas morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to try my new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent all this time with it,
and I finally get to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I do it, especially something
that I've just bred, and it's his first
[SPEAKER_00]: run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I bred something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pheno hunted those seeds, and now I
finally have a finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is real satisfaction to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this may be your first time getting to
enjoy this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this to be a great experience for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want every harvest to be a wonderful
experience for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one thing that can really ruin
your experience when it comes to testing
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that can really fuck it up
is by being impatient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut down your plants too early,
they aren't going to be the quality you
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dried and cured your plants in a
rushing manner, you are not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality that you deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, make sure those plants got to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your plants were flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they were harvested,
dried, and cured, and trimmed correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not try to smoke our first crop too
early and put a bad taste in our mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: literally, about our new crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to dry it fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to taste like shit,
and you're going to feel like shit about
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have just a bad feeling
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let each bud be ready before you smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the first thing we need to test before
we get down to smoking this product is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dry enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you dried and cured this product
properly before we go putting it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grinder and try to roll it up or put it in
a pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is acceptable for a cured herb to be
kind of sticky and a little bit moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way a lot of people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get a lot of that in the
Colorado area because we have what is
[SPEAKER_00]: known as the Colorado Crunch here,
and I do plan to do a podcast all about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado Crunch in the future,
but let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your dried and cured herb
before we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a little spongy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a little sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have cured it properly,
that is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to take a couple of nugs out
of the jar and set them on the table for
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four, maybe five or six hours
before you decide to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon to see a connoisseur
smoker pull out his jar of nugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: crack the lid, take out three or four
nuggets, set them on the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: seal the jar up, put it back in his little
stash spot and then leave those nuggets on
[SPEAKER_00]: the table throughout the day, and that's
what we smoke on as the day goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be a little bit damp as soon as
we pull them out of the jar, but as the
[SPEAKER_00]: day goes on, they're going to dry out
perfectly to roll a fat joint and pack a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure your herb is cured and dry
enough to burn properly so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: disappoint yourself with your first
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're confident that your buds
are dried and cured and ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, let's talk about taking that
first taste test of our new crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, testing a new product is sort of a
combination between a science experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: and a ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be in my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use my equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take away variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can see what the actual product
is telling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that may sound weird to some
people, but a lot of stoners are very
[SPEAKER_00]: ritualistic, and by ritualistic,
I don't mean some fancy ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean I like to be in a certain
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my comfortable smoking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you gave me a new concentrate,
if you gave me some flour and you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I want you to judge this or rate
this, this would be the best place for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to conduct that experiment so that I could
give you a proper review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the door is locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can consume safely here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that nobody can bother me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control the environment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control the music here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great place for myself to
consume any type of cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couch over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bed about 50 feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's snacks in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm set up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got my little chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my drinks right here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the computer so I could browse the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my next step in this talk is my
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all my favorite smoking equipment
just to the right of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite pipe is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite dab rig is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my tools to keep those things in
proper smoking condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the ritual is being in the
right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got that little place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your little chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that little spot on your bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got that one little cozy spot
where they want to chill and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in your little cozy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get comfy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on the music that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the air the way you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in your right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, get your favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got that favorite bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got that favorite dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got that favorite pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in your comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe there are certain people you
do or don't like to smoke around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to smoke your crop for the
first time by yourself or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it fun and bring your friends along
and be like, bro, check out what I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try it together for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to have your friends
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that puts you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you smoke it and it tastes like you
just stuck your tongue in a light socket
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone's going to get to smoke that
with you and experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and share it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what everybody thinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that
reaction in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that is really fun to
involve your friends in is if you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grew five seeds, you've probably
got five different phenotypes or maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three different phenotypes to select
from out of those five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to load up five bowls or
roll five joints and label them somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the end of the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write number one, number two, or just
remember and then smoke them with your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and see if you guys like plant
number one, plant number two, plant number
[SPEAKER_00]: three better.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if different people in the room like
number one or number three better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe everybody in the room says,
bro, number five was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun to bring your friends
around to consume with you to see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want your first try your ritual?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that to happen with friends
around or do you want that to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go both ways in my little comfort
zone right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two chairs right in front of me
where Mike is always invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin likes to take this spot right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several other folks that come
over and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple other chairs we can pull
out if it gets crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to smoke your
first crop with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be timid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want some friends around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I recommend when you come to
sampling your new product is make it your
[SPEAKER_00]: first smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke anything before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eat any edibles before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in totally sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in fresh so that you know exactly what
your product has done to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me back up a couple of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by grinding up our
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you are in your comfortable spot with
your people, with your music plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a drink on hand, and you're ready to
rock, the first couple of things to
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming your new flowers are a visual
inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look and see what we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's enjoy the beauty of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What colors do you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you trim it well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you trim it better next time by
looking at it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do the trichomes look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that plant real frosty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just kind of frosty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a nice look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it up to your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a lot of work into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next step is to give it a
little bit of a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you may break it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to put this in a grinder and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can destroy this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd give it a little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: How moist is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's ready to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to embarrass yourself by
trying to put that in the pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really need just another day or two
of curing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it need to sit on the table for a
couple hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your last chance before you grind
it up in front of your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it feel in your hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it real sticky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you've played with it a little
bit, smell the inside of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to absorb and enjoy all of this stuff,
especially if it's your first crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is like your thousandth crop,
slow down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop and smell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most rewarding parts of
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's enjoy this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not think too much about how much
did we harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it weigh?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's enjoy the actual flowers that we
have grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's enjoy the effort we made that turned
into a consumable product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, that has a great aroma to it,
that is a work of art and nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: science all put together that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to put it in a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put it in the grinder and give it
a couple of turns, if that grinder is
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to spin, your buds may be too
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open up that grinder,
if it's a little moist in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to tell at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that one bud is a little bit too wet,
you still need to let the rest of the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure just a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dry them a little bit more and you
will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you feel like the bud that you
have ground up is ready to consume,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your favorite way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke earlier about your favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to roll a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a joint kind of a person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a bong kind of a person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a pipe kind of a person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to throw up the vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, you can do it however you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, for me, don't wrap it up in a
blunt wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just spent so much time growing the
most delicious herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dried it and cured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you going to wrap it up in a paper
bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am all about smoking a fat joint,
but I do not appreciate smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to roll it up,
get yourself some good papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something like some raws, some
elements, something quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, for this first test,
please don't roll it up in a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're on this subject,
if you're going to pack a bowl,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean your pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some fresh herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your friends over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to impress yourself and your
friends the best you can with this new
[SPEAKER_00]: herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean your pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're smoking through the bong,
dude, clean the bong and change the bong
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe how many places I go
to smoke a bong load and the water looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like muck and I will not smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just change the bong water,
clean your piece, and everybody will enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: it much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will make your product taste much
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to impress everybody,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do the best we can to make your
product taste the best that it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you ground up your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a fat joint rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a bong load packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a pipe loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you filled up the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a volcano bag going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you decided to do it, now it is
time to take our first puff of our freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: dried and cured cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I recommend this
being your first puff of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know exactly what your herb
does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now come to my favorite part of
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now time to smoke the first sample
of our newly harvested crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you rolled up a joint, now's the
time to spark it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you packed up a bowl, now's the time to
start taking a couple of puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the vaporizer going,
now's the time to start taking a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple of pools, a couple of draws,
a couple of toks off your new product and
[SPEAKER_00]: sit back for a couple of seconds and let
it sit in and see what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much you consume but
depending on your consumption level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should probably be able to take two,
three, maybe four good draws or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking a joint, maybe two or
three good draws.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking a bowl, maybe two or
three, maybe three or four good puffs off
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hitting the bong, hopefully you
only need one or two good bong rips before
[SPEAKER_00]: you start feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find vaporizers to be unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know if I'm going to need one or
six pools off the vaporizer but take as
[SPEAKER_00]: many as you're comfortable with,
get a little buzz on and sit back for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of seconds and just see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get mellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get low?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get giggly and goofy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got other friends in the room,
start conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will start talking about the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start talking about the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will mention the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will mention the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversation will start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to how your friends react to
your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a mental note of what you think of
the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like the aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like the buzz that you've gotten
from the way you've consumed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it may be time to take a couple of
more puffs and go to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you've pushed it a little bit,
how do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you super stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you stuck to the couch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you flying off the couch and just
hanging on for dear life?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it making you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it acting to your friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they lit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they bored?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, are they enjoying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the words that they're
saying and try to make a mental note of
[SPEAKER_00]: their review of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few things to look
for while you are smoking your first
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look for some things about the
product to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does your product burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn smoothly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it burn like a charcoal briquette or
did it burn a nice white ash?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the ash that you knocked off the end of
your joint or that chunk that you dumped
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your bowl at the end, if that was
chunky and black, you may not have flushed
[SPEAKER_00]: your product long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want a longer flush time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may not have dried it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may still be a little bit wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not burning properly, it could
still be a little moist and it needs more
[SPEAKER_00]: dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to how it burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how does it smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the smoke nice and smokey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it nice and smooth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that smoke thick and harsh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it hurt your throat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make you cough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can you just toke on it all day and
blow clouds and it doesn't bother your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs and throat at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make improvements in your next
grow based on the quality of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those things on point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the flavor and aroma and burn
factor are not on point, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely correct those in your next
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about paying attention to
what your friends say because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be very proud of your
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent a lot of time on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to think it is the best herb
you've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very natural thing for new
growers to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke a lot of herb also.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have very influential
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let their criticism hurt your
feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take their compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one of your friends says,
bro, this shit smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe you grew this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the other guy says, bro, this kind of
burns my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take that criticism as
strongly as you did that compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both matter equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use the compliment as a driving force
to move you forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the criticism as a way to improve your
crop next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be hurt when one of your friends
says, bro, that weed burns my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because you did something wrong and
you need to improve and he was honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you because he's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that some of the
things that you may need to improve that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll notice right away are your flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that product burning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, is it a dark chunk or is it a nice
white clean ash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn all the way through the joint
or do you need to keep relighting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's burning real black and chunky and
you need to keep relighting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably need it to flush longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it just keeps going out, but it's not
burning real black, it may just be too wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and you need to dry and cure it a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your cure process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the herb taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it crunchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you dry and cure it to your liking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your friends think you dried and cured
it properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're happy, that's what
matters as long as you are consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to market, it's got to
satisfy the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to what the market says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how did you trim it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you satisfied with the trim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your clients satisfied with the trim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can improve on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the trim, a lot of new growers don't
trim enough, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go a little bit harder on your
trim job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you were consuming the product
and you can actually tell what type of
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz it gives you, do you think you should
have flowered a little bit longer or do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you should have flowered a
little bit shorter?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay attention to the finished
product and how things came out this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you took plenty of notes throughout the
grow, you can look at your notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at your finished product,
and you can see things that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve for the next run, which will make
you a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take all of those compliments and take
all of that criticism and ball it all up
[SPEAKER_00]: into one big learning lesson and think of
ways to improve your crop next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the overall deciding factor on the
quality of this product is how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you going for a low couch lock kind
of a buzz or were you going for a big
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic head spinning high and did you
get what you were after?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think if you would have let that
plant flower a little bit longer that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have gotten better quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think maybe you would have gotten a
little fatter yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think maybe if you would have
chopped it a little later that it may have
[SPEAKER_00]: started to diminish the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think if you would have cut it a
little bit earlier that it would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more head buzzy and a little bit
racier?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things to think about as you are
testing the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you satisfied with your finished
product is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're satisfied, don't change a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are things that you're not
satisfied with, look at your notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: think of ways that you can improve those
things for your next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I started off our little science
experiment slash ritual of testing our
[SPEAKER_00]: first crop by sitting in our little
comfortable environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis consumers, stoners, potheads,
whatever you want to call us, I'm okay
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this tendency to smoke and get
trapped in our little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nice and comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, the music is just
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fridge is full of snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bros are right here at the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to go anywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you step out of this little
comfort zone, you may be twice as
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be twice as stoned as you even
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to smoke a whole bunch of
product and sit here and be blazed out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your mind to be comfortable because this
is the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know where everything is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a drink right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the dab rig is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the pen is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where everything is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no chaos right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe call an Uber and have them take you
to the mall or to the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just go get some food somewhere with
your bros and just get out of the house
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're freshly buzzed on that fresh
new product and see what kind of brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences the world brings to you out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this thing about stoners that once
you smoke, you've got about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get up and leave in 10
minutes, you're fucking stuck wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: just smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoke a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're comfortable just hanging out at
the house, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But next time, take a few puffs of that
new product, call an Uber and go somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting and see what life brings you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get into some cool new adventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my talk about sampling and trying
our freshly harvested cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something.

couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy memory cards.
