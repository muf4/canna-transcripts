[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I picked up some Crescendo live
batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crescendo is a cross of Chem D,
I-95, and Mandarin cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
heavy chem, gas, and cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cracked this concentrate open,
I was delighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color and texture of this batter are
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this aroma punches you in the
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you get, the first thing I
get, is a sweetness, and it makes you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, what's that sweet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you smell, and it's like
chocolate chip cookie dough, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's gas and chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gassy funk right in the face,
but the sweetness really comes to your
[SPEAKER_00]: face first, or at least my face first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say what's gonna happen to your
nose, but I get that sweetness,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it is really backed up by a
really powerful chem dog, gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: funk sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really loving the Crescendo live
batter from Green Dot Labs, and it has got
[SPEAKER_00]: me lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the buzz that I get from
this concentrate, and the flavor is just
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a chocolate chip cookie and some
gassy chem, and I am loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs, and of course, an extra thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to my friends at the Colorado Cannabis
Exchange for taking good care of me when
[SPEAKER_00]: they got the fresh Green Dot drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Quarantinians and Coronians,
in this episode, I'm going to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to the kind folks who continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of today's bong rips and dabs and
joints will of course be digital and
[SPEAKER_00]: virtual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to adjust to today's world,
so until we get things back under control,
[SPEAKER_00]: until everybody is safe and healthy,
let's go ahead and send some virtual
[SPEAKER_00]: digital bong rips and digital dabs to all
of our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by rolling up a big fat
digital joint, lighten that fucker up
[SPEAKER_00]: virtually, and pass it over to my buddy
Keith R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's pack up a big fat bong load.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to send that digital bong rip
over to my buddy Moroni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to pack up some delicious
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some rosin on the dab or let's
get the nail nice and warm and let's send
[SPEAKER_00]: that digital dab over to my buddy
Freakfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's get some sticky dank herb,
put that in the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's put some Keith on top of that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send that one over to my buddy
Carlos B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should also bake up a big fat tray of
surprising potent edibles and send those
[SPEAKER_00]: over to my buddy Tobes McLovin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to roll up a fat joint and put
some Keith down the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to send that fucker over to
Mason602.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to send a special high five and a
digital dab over to my buddy Dan the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always got a virtual bong rip for
my buddy OkieGro720.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a gravity bong with my buddy
Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody forgot about the gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about some gravity bong for my friends
out at Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget our friends Rick Roller
keeping us fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends Rick Roller
with their food truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big digital dab to my friends Rick Roller
and everybody in the food truck game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's wrap up these digital shout outs
by sending a giant big fat bong rip over
[SPEAKER_00]: to my buddy Nate Williams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big high five to everybody who has
continued to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not already supporting the
show and you would like to learn how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: so all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I did include a link in the
show notes to make it easy for my stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're curious what happens to
those Patreon contributions I recently
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for my website renewal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is where I host the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show goes up to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into an RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the show available for Apple
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the show available for
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the website and the RSS feed was
covered by the Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody who helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also try to keep the MacBook up to
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to do some updates and repairs
to my computer that I use for the show
[SPEAKER_00]: that came through the Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also buy new fresh microphone covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recently purchased some podcast
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some little flyers made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the orders that come from Seeds
here now so that we can share the show
[SPEAKER_00]: with more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to improve the show by
buying better and more equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also trying to expand our audience by
getting some advertising made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what is happening with your
Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks once again and big shout out
for all of the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters and pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to move into the email portion
of today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been getting a lot of messages on
several different platforms with questions
[SPEAKER_00]: for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way for you to get your
question on the show is to email me at
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the easiest way for me to find all
of the messages in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find them on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find messages on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find them on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the easiest place for me to keep all
of my messages in one place is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the email inbox at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm writing a podcast, when I'm doing
work for the show, that is the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for messages and questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for me to keep those all in
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you comment on YouTube, I have to
remember which video you left a comment
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to scroll back and find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I try to take a screenshot with
my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to get your question on
the show, the most reliable way is to send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into today's first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from a friend who signed
it as a demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subject is question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I really love
your show and all of the work you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have learned a lot so far
listening to your podcast and the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at the dude
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoy my show, I think you would
really enjoy the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available wherever you're listening
to my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're here on iTunes, if you're here
on YouTube, the dude grows is available on
[SPEAKER_00]: that platform as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll learn a lot from them as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that one when this show is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes on to say, I am on my
second grow and things are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this grow is a little bit better
than the first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hope the next grow is even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have more questions,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, we have medical here where I
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am growing my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has got to be an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you've got the right to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very stress relieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were probably growing your medicine
before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got that little bit of
stress taken off your shoulders and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're producing a product that at the end
of the day will make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feeling is a big part of why I am in
the medical marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: why I've stuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: For so long and why I've got such passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run a medical marijuana
dispensary in my town and I would help
[SPEAKER_00]: elderly people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would help young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would help mentally ill people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would help people of all walks of lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from everywhere with all types
of situations and I would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve all of their lives in a very small
way by helping them out with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a product I grew and then gave to these
people and they smoked and they came back
[SPEAKER_00]: next week and they looked like they were
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentally and physically better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in looking like they were in
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in looking depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in looking alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold them a quarter, a good herb and I
told them, come back next week and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came back with a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Hey Ross, to Jeff, I smoked
that and my back pain went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since my back pain went away,
I wasn't an asshole to my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I wasn't an asshole to my wife,
we got along and we had dinner and now my
[SPEAKER_00]: life is way better and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's snowballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start seeing those effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling now, but I've got a lot of
passion for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still get to see those effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed strains that are known worldwide
and people are finding relief from strains
[SPEAKER_00]: I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is such a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm proud of you for taking the leap to
grow your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put a lot of pride and
care into that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke it, you will feel that
pride, that care and that love come right
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll inhale and you'll be filled with
pride and relief and you'll feel better
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll say, Holy shit, I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that feeling alone will make you feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then smoking will make you feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself on track because I've
got a lot of rambles in me from that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, the question I have is about
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed and follow you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following me on Instagram,
I recommend you do so on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I R I E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can spell genetics by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also find me on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on Cannabuzz with the same name Iri
underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a free social media
application, a lot like Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is much more cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can post your dab videos and your grow
photos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot buy, sell or trade cannabis on
Cannabuzz, but it is a cannabis friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: social media application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join me and I am going to
talk about Cannabuzz later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stick around for that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, there's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've noticed that you post a lot
of pictures of your work on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you get in trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I'm getting mixed
messages, looking up, looking it up
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks and have a great day from demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do post a lot of cannabis content on
social media, especially Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to post every day to those social
media platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot of great photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a good following.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is that safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good and very important
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many variables which play into
my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first question is, is it legal to grow
cannabis where you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are posting from an illegal place,
you may need to make extra security
[SPEAKER_00]: measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to use a VPN.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to do things to keep yourself
and your location extra private.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in an illegal location and you
want to post photos of your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't post other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post pictures of outside because a
lot of people are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have very good memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet makes things way too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you post an intersection and I can
recognize one building in that
[SPEAKER_00]: intersection, I can find your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I am a robber or a cop or somebody
who wants to fuck with you, I can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: you problems very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world has gotten strange with the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very mindful of what you're posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an illegal area, only post
photos of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a dedicated grow account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also use a VPN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also do whatever you can do to make sure
you're not posting any meta data in your
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of data attached to a
photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's taken with your iPhone,
your iPhone knows when, where and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: photo was taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows the time and date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows the exact location and it also
remembers the settings of your camera when
[SPEAKER_00]: you took that photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of info stored in that
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first thing I worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not in a legal area,
you need to up your privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever post your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post your hands if you've got
tattoos on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recognize people by their tattoos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can recognize you by your tattoos,
so can law enforcement, so can robbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: so can whoever wants to cause you
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a weird octopus tattoo on
your hand, cover that shit up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some initials or something
tattooed on you, cover that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main concern obviously is safety in
an illegal area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post your vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post license plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't post familiar landmarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to have a grow based
Instagram account, only make it a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: based Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put your dog in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put your family in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put other shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it just as a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make another account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post all your silly shit that you want to
post there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that one fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give people any hints, especially
law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a non-legal area,
you need to be much more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are in a legal area,
we still have things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your limit is six plants, never post a
picture of more than six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep in mind that people like to
steal shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who are entering the
cannabis business, the cannabis game,
[SPEAKER_00]: that have forgotten that at one point this
was criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still brings a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still brings a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still brings a lot of profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people out there who would
rather take your work and make your profit
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of doing the work themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you post a photo, hey, look at my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy down the street goes,
hey, I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His grows almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to wait 10 or 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you post a picture of harvest
and let him know it's fucking done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come in your front door,
maybe come in your back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to leave you in a scary
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows how that's going to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not even think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful with what you're
posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal of posting shit is for
people to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want them to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who may be seeing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody on the planet can open up
Instagram and find your photos once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: posted them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also grab a screenshot and that
photo never goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stored forever in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably sent it to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something good, that shit will
never disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful what you're posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give away your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give away your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep your vehicles and all that
shit private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep repeating myself, but security is
very important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to say, Rasta Jeff,
you post a ton of photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the photos I post come from
commercial cultivation facilities in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: First key part, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial recreational grows can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that as long as we stay within
our legal limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never post more than your limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't brag too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show the whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mentioned commercial cultivation
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fully legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get paid to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city has inspected our buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know exactly what's happening in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can post those shots worry-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they are very secure facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got fences around every building.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the doors are super locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more cameras than you could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are crazy alarm systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything goes on there,
that's a very secure environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The personal homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I post photos of that, here's
something I don't talk about very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the photos I post are a little bit
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have taught my friends, never post an
upcoming harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post that harvest when the product is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be a couple of weeks behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're posting pictures of almost
finished plants, they should be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be harvested, dried and cured
and either consumed or sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you do, that shit should be
gone before you post a photo of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my method of staying a little bit
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also practice a theory known as don't
shit where you eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow is in your house,
don't have people over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell people where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your grow in a separate location if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but it's ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody did see me posting photos
of a harvest, they said, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is chopping down plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There ain't shit here because I'm not
shitting where I eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My food's at another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My shit's at another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't find them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're seeing the photos and
you're timing your moves based on my
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, you're two weeks late because I
already moved all that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few ways to throw people
off if you were trying to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram that could be making you a
little bit paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind, like I've said before,
that everybody on the planet can see
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you post and many of your
photos will contain digital data that will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell your location and your time and the
settings that you use on those photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology is amazing, but technology can
also be a motherfucker sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about a couple of other
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously the number one thing to
think about when it comes to posting on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to incriminate yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will your Instagram feed be used against
you in a court of law?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will your Instagram videos, will your live
feed be used against you in a court of
[SPEAKER_00]: law?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how you're going to defend all
of your shit when you were on the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to say about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me posing by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me with a selfie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to work in court?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we have to think about is
Instagram can be a little bitch sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is not a fan of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want us on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to find logical, rational reasons
to get rid of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of us play by the rules very
closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We barely dance on the rules and they
don't take down our accounts because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we play.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you post the wrong content or if you
use the wrong words on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will delete your post and enough
deleted posts will result in a banned
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that when I post pictures of
plants and flowers, Instagram doesn't take
[SPEAKER_00]: them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I post dried buds or smoking videos,
those get noticed and flagged and taken
[SPEAKER_00]: down immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do not use the hashtags or the words
cannabis or marijuana or anything in that
[SPEAKER_00]: realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe hashtag 420, maybe hashtag ganja
farmer, but those are also used to find
[SPEAKER_00]: posts to be taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful how you're tagging your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know for sure, but from what I
have seen from my posts and other friends'
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts, when you're posting plants,
those are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute we cut it down and trim it
and dry it and cure it, I think Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: decides at that point that it's cannabis
and now it's drugs in their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think posting educational photos of
plants is working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute we start smoking it and
consuming it, that is when Instagram has a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, never post a dollar sign in
your description, in your comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram can find the dollar sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are looking for that dollar sign in
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they see that, your post will get
flagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to be doing business
of any kind on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're selling shoes, if you're selling
Nikes, if you're selling fucking COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: masks, they don't want that happening
unless you've got a business account and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will flag you and they'll take
your shit down for the use of a dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but we're
walking on thin ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a weird part of history right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is quasi-legal in some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is looked at in a very different
light right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But businesses have to act like cannabis
is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to follow the most strict rule
wherever they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're in the United States,
which I'm pretty sure that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is based, they have to follow
the rules and laws of whichever state has
[SPEAKER_00]: the strictest cannabis rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is a multimillion dollar
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want to lose a dollar of that
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want to go to court.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be accused of
advocating, promoting, or facilitating any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If two strangers or two people who know
each other communicate through Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is a transfer of an illegal
product and an exchange of money,
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram just facilitated an illegal deal
and they can be charged with a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those two people go to jail,
they get in trouble and they have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: smart lawyer, they can say, what about
Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram was a third party in this drug
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound completely crazy,
but lawyers and law and judges are also
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Instagram is doing everything they can
to keep themselves out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody has a rule that says you
can run 10 miles an hour here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go three miles an hour here,
you can go one here, Instagram is safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: they go with the one mile an hour rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they don't get in trouble in the
one mile an hour zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the main objective is
to not piss off Instagram, not to disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: the Instagram algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get noticed too much by Instagram,
but do what you can to get noticed by your
[SPEAKER_00]: followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understand that what they are doing is
a basic business practice to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves from losing millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think it's bullshit,
but if you had multi-million dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would do a lot of stupid shit to
protect that money as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talking about money, that makes me
think of something I should probably say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not take legal advice from a guy with
dreadlocks to his knees who calls himself
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are taking legal advice from me,
you are going to have a bad time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not qualified for that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm telling you is basically my
experience and what I've learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: playing and dealing with Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had several accounts taken down and
I know how to message and interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: them to get my accounts reinstated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel very lucky that I've gotten this
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I keep in mind is we've
come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was doing this back in the day,
we had to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tried to take a picture of your
weed plants, one of your friends would
[SPEAKER_00]: slap your fucking camera out of your hand
and say, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take pictures of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to have the opportunity to share
my ganja photos with the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have come a really long
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a different mindset because I
come from the dark ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you younger folks have never had
to experience that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people came into the cannabis
game, the cannabis industry, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene when it was already legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't have to worry about that
sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, I came from the
dark ages of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you told anybody about your grow,
you were already fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one rule of growing was don't
tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like fight club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk about fight club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people start talking about how
Instagram hates us and social media is
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit and all that, I kind of laugh
when I say, bro, if I would have posted
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these pictures 15 years ago,
my house would have been raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: My front door would have been pulled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flash bangs would have been thrown in the
windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dogs would have been shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut all of your couch cushions open
with a razor blade because you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding drugs in the couch cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dump all of your food out of your
fridge and your refrigerator because you
[SPEAKER_00]: may be hiding drugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They destroy your fucking house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take you to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave the front door unlocked when
they take you to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows who the fuck is going to come
into your house while all of your shit is
[SPEAKER_00]: just splayed out everywhere because the
cops dumped it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at it as a completely different
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can post our photos of our cannabis
to Instagram and sit back and see how many
[SPEAKER_00]: likes we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it makes me laugh when I hear
the youngsters talking about how social
[SPEAKER_00]: media is controlling and will not allow us
to do our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, back in the day, they used to rage
you for this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they just take down your account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start a new account.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer to that is if you were
in a legal area and you feel safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: go ahead and post your garden,
but also take measures to keep yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't show your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to reveal your location unless you
are ready to deal with that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some unwanted repercussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my friend Demo, I want to thank you

delicious.

ridiculous.

much edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I just become a zombie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into a coma.
