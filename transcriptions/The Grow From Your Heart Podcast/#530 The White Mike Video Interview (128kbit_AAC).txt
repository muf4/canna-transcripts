[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 530 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me via zoom for his first time on
video is white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brave new world folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brave new world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some positive shit did come out of the
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we wouldn't again, if we would not have
gotten locked down, I don't think we ever
[SPEAKER_02]: would have ended up doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The virus, not the beer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the beer still a thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I feel sorry for the beer company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should, I don't drink, but I feel like
I should just buy a bunch of Corona's just
[SPEAKER_02]: because.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start drinking because of the fucking
virus would be like a way to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't do that guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temporarily for all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because they don't have people to
make the beer?
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to send the people home or is it
just nobody's buying the damn beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sales plummeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: January because people are dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the toilet paper thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fucking rhyme or reason to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just people heard Corona virus and
they were like, Oh fuck, dude switched to
[SPEAKER_00]: Modelo herd mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sheep logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, thank you for joining me on zoom.

uh, I am dabbing some stuff called first
[SPEAKER_02]: matter premium concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new to me to be viewers today and
get to see what we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time they'll actually get a
view of what we're dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If my sweaty hands can get this child
proof container open, it's making that
[SPEAKER_02]: skippy sound where it's hard to open.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is first matter premium
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it says contains marijuana,
keep away from children on the back of the
[SPEAKER_02]: package.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, uh, this product contains 94.4%
THC a, um, it's one gram of alchemy
[SPEAKER_02]: crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was gifted this by a friend,
uh, via another friend, shout out to
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, passing things along for friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you crack open this jar, this was a
one gram fat diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put them on a dabber and show
the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This company specializes in just straight
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: T H C a diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're watching this on the camera,
on the video, that is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a T H C a diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already dabbed about half of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is half of what was left in the half
of what was in the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a gift and it was specially
selected for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may have been bigger than a gram,
but that was a very beautiful diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is odorless and it is flavorless,
but it is very potent when you dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it makes your arm, my arm hair stand
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me get real talkative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got red, my body temperature went up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a fucking big dab also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was, I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the person who gave it to me
recommended she's like, I know you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably have some Terp sauce or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it when you mix it with a
little bit of Terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some Terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this little 10 gram jar of lemon
OG Terp sauce from our friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: apothecary farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put a little chunk of that
concentrate on the, uh, just on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I dipped it into a little bit of
this Terp sauce, try to get that on the
[SPEAKER_02]: camera there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just liquid terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis derived terpenes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a high, uh, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably seven or eight grams left
in that jar there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but we put some of that on it and that
was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high goes straight to the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Kapow instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you dab it, you're like,
Oh, I might be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get, I got real high from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, kind of almost too talkative,
almost racy, almost a paranoid sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: thing for a minute, but once it's settled,
then I was loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super high, like psychedelic high,
like let's go do some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, good concert kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, unfortunately we're just hanging out
here at the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, but it was a great buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to our new friends from first
matter, premium concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't pay to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't ask for anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they threw me a gram of concentrates
and I fucking approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really good way to get
yourself on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I just have to like your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't like your product, I won't put
you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause why would I share it with my
friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mike, I feel like I've been talking a
long time about what I've been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to share with us what
you're smoking today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I've been smoking today is
the sour dish little ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that coming through folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of light down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of coming through on the video
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks pretty good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would dab that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice diamonds, delicious sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's doing his damn job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say you sound stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of details and just that hash
worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mike is smoking sour diesel ambrosia
from our friends at apothecary farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not to be a hater of your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a fan of sour diesel
concentrates, but I love the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about extracting it doesn't
bring that proper essence in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loses something for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, I was missing the sour D and
that's what was available.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buzz is still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want that sour D high that the
buzz, the high, the medicine, the
[SPEAKER_02]: medication, whatever the effect,
you're going to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't, I think it just something
about the sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell it through the bag in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who's got that diesel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the kind of diesel that I
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I missed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when you smoke it, everybody for
four miles looks towards you going,
[SPEAKER_02]: damn, your weed smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were spoiled here for a lot of years
with good diesel everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I had a couple of friends who grew
that diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to those guys for doing a really
good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of them listens to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, big ups dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sure do man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow somewhere that sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My legal limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'll take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Mike, this is the portion of the show
where we do shout outs to our friends who
[SPEAKER_02]: support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was rolling up digital joints and
passing up digital bong loads that seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: to suck up a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also got really tongue tied during
all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of my friends from Patreon,
you all get a dab, a bong rip and edible
[SPEAKER_02]: and a pre-roll to take home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's send them all a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off with giant Mike and the
dab and queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's send a big shout out to helly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a big giant shout out to my friend E
two Oh five seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh five seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't read my own damn handwriting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what Oh five seven means,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big shout out to, are you lighting up

[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, I'm proud of you for getting the
video show going and a Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020 is here, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been in 2015 for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm proud of you for making it this
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on lockdown for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to get inventive and a Patreon and
some video episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be the way to do it
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a good way to make a positive out
of a negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people need some entertainment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get their mind off of things
and seeing our smiley or whatever you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to call it, our pasty faces here on the
screen is a good way for people to escape
[SPEAKER_02]: and also learn something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could pass them a virtual fucking joint
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could grab it through the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can hang out and they can
learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get edumacated and it's fucking
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm missing the flowers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need flowers down in my bunker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been keeping the flowers outside
at this new place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, that's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash only in the bunker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a side effect of the no smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody else is getting
this, but I am very confused by the
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons and the time of year right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep forgetting that it is spring and
going into summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep feeling like we just got fucked for
summer and we're going into winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been shopping online and most of my
clothes are fall and winter appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've purchased.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dab yourself all the way to the end of
the year already, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, something about the lockdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm like, well, we got fucked for
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see the spring happen like I
normally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess I'm used to it just being
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was going to continue to
be cold or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain was... You went inside when it
was cold out and your body hasn't told you
[SPEAKER_00]: it's summer yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 420, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have had a 420 party.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should add an Easter party.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should add a St. Patrick's Day party.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should have been so many things to
tell my mind and body that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: progressed in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it's been Groundhog Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing the same fucking Tuesday
every day, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day is Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you listeners,
but the Groundhog Day thing, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking legit during the lockdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully people are listening to this,
what would be the future from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't try to dwell too much on the
COVID-19 thing, but just an update.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are recording late night on April 27th.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's early in the morning on the 27th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were we six weeks into the quarantine
COVID-19 situation now?
[SPEAKER_02]: March 26th is we're a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a month since Colorado started
the real stay home order.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really... I've left and I've
gone a few places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gone anywhere to go enjoy and be
somewhere since March 12th.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 12th of March was the last time I've
really gone out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a few people because there are a
few things that were almost necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions, like things that just have
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen you once or twice that were
brief interactions, but I know we won't
[SPEAKER_02]: talk too much about that, but that had to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to get equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: How were you going to record if you didn't
get equipment from me?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to teach you that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be silly to mail me equipment
that was already mailed to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was no way to teach you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like I have to see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to teach him this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was one equipment lesson,
but it's been kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm adapting well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've talked about previous times,
I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of a hermit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good at being a hermit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been practicing this isolation games
since I was a teenager, since high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this wasn't too bad for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike, I know you're kind of a gamer
and you've got some family at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, the kids at home,
that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got entertainment or whatever you
want to call it all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a couple of days back, me and my
oldest kids, four almost five,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went for a drive for the first time in
like three weeks and we hit the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we got on the highway,
it was like, dad, it feels like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, we were doing like 35
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, we had just gotten onto the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just hit the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh buddy, we've been at home
for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go to the growth store to get
supplies and there was nobody out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy at the growth store,
he wasn't sleeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that the guy at the store
wasn't doing his job, but he should have
[SPEAKER_02]: been sleeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the only customer he had seen all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and he wanted to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, so what are you going to grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of me going to grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long are you going to veggie?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long are you going to flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, just talk to me, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here for all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see it on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you to all the people who are
keeping businesses going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a struggle right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see it on your face, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have brought him lunch or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show up with food for the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, we've been rambling for
quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not really pay attention to how long
we've been going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about 15, 17 minutes into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben, I'm awesomely excited to have you
here on a video show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this would be a good
opportunity to kind of do the official
[SPEAKER_02]: white Mike interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been around for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been on a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: People know kind of who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what you're about, but they
don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know much about you other than
what we've talked about on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only, I said earlier, the only real
credit you've got is because I've given
[SPEAKER_02]: you street cred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say you're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if Rasta Jeff brought him around,
he's got to be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wouldn't bring too crazy of a person
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been vetted, but who knows how
totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that basically you're like my
cohost or one of my best friends or
[SPEAKER_02]: probably my best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sidekick is basically what they know
and that you fucking ramble a lot and that
[SPEAKER_02]: you drink Mountain Dew and you smoke dabs
and that you haven't had a cigarette and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking how many days now, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, three months, five days.
[SPEAKER_02]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are things that they know about
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like today is a really good
opportunity to learn a little bit more and
[SPEAKER_02]: share that shit about my friend white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this episode, guys, we're going to
do the official white Mike interview week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike interview volume one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may do this in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to start it off by talking about
how and where I met my buddy white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was honored and privileged to be a part
of the very first dispenser here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Metomar Ministries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were kind of flying under a radar by
putting the word ministries on there and
[SPEAKER_02]: it worked, but we were Metomar Ministries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were ran by a guy named Tom and his
beautiful wife, Karen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace, Karen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you and I miss you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could pass you a joint right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple of other folks
involved in that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to mention Chrisann and Tree,
several other folks, but I was mainly the
[SPEAKER_02]: dude running the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a dispensary that was kind of
operating in an apartment and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how about we open an office and do this
for real?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, if you're brave enough
to go set up a counter and do this,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, we're doing it kind of
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just fucking do it for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to do it, we're going to
get in trouble up here or down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in what, 2009?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 2008 is when we got it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started doing it, winter of 2008 is
when I met the guy in the apartment,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, because I got my medical card
around before Christmas around
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanksgiving that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe if I've got a brain injury,
Mike, so you got to give me some credit on
[SPEAKER_02]: my timelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timeline sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008-ish, early 2009-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think winter of 2008 is when I met
the guy in the apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: By early 2009, we had moved it downstairs
to the retail place and we had opened up a
[SPEAKER_02]: full on retail dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working six days a week from open to
close in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not bragging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my position.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had so much interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, at least in Colorado,
selling weed over the counter was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit like being a space ranger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: People thought I was a superhero.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would bring me snacks and food and
lunch and stickers and gifts all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there weren't restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a stoner fantasy that this was a
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you couldn't decide if you wanted to
buy jar A or jar B, I'd pack up a bowl of
[SPEAKER_02]: jar A and a bowl of jar B and we fucking
smoke them and see which one you like
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you could make your decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd smoke them right there in the fucking
office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, that dispensary got popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were banging and I couldn't keep up by
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike kept coming in with another person,
his father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much detail I should
convey here, but Mike came in with his
[SPEAKER_02]: father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had already known his father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_02]: His father-in-law was a cool cantankerous
old guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came in several times without Mike and
then he came in a few times with Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I just made friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then one time, I will remember this
forever, Mike and his old man came to my
[SPEAKER_02]: house to hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just became smoking buddies and the
doorbell rang.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time that your old man
really introduced us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Jeff, Mike, Mike, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you must be the C.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was calling your old man, the old man,
the old man and the C, the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got my literary reference fucking spot
on without hesitation and you laughed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, being this guy or friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd already liked you from coming into the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You speak well, you're articulate,
you're fucking smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in similar lines of music.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to argue about the music,
but deep down, our roots are the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both love ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to put ganja in a positive
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We became friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the manager at that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the opportunity by the owner to hire
another budtender and an assistant
[SPEAKER_02]: manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was honestly the first person to come
to my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's well-spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trust him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, I know this guy,
Mike, let's fucking give him a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They interviewed him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they probably hired you on the
spot knowing Tom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one of the stranger days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, do you want to work here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, tell me a little bit
about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him like a little five minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what's up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could do this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he left and I went to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically, that place didn't have a
lot of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have paper work.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he was from North Carolina and he was
an older guy and he had the exact attitude
[SPEAKER_02]: you think an older weed grower from North
Carolina would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as the weed grew, landed on the
shelf, turned into money, we got
[SPEAKER_02]: paychecks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything else would go and be
all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't give too much of a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually, unfortunately, that
dispensary was closed by our city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew it was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit was evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: City came in, politely closed us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have done it much more
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have all been arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came in and said, hey, please quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were given the opportunity to close
the doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our smart ass answer was, what about all
the people in line?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind enough to let us serve the
people in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they came in, a few people got up and
booked.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they saw a cop come in,
they were gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a few people were like, I've got a
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people that stayed, I gave them most
of the product we had on hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I split all of the remaining product with
the permission of the owner and the
[SPEAKER_02]: manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: I split all of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had all the product.
I had all the supplies.
I had all the supply and they got it all.
So we had a couple of hours and all the
stuff was all loaded up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last couple of months,
the last customers and the last employees
[SPEAKER_02]: in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, it's our last day here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's all of our bonus checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dispensary closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we all loaded up that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we didn't steal anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner was standing there next to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, Mike kind of became my
helper.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was already one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking earned his spot of being my
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in the passenger seat of my van.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was fucking my video game buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I ended up hanging out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He became my helper in my personal grow
and anywhere else that we went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike would just be in my van.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of became my main trimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike would be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was trimming herb, I could count on
Mike being there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was my grow helper.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could build shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most importantly, he became one of my very
best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't talk about that enough,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a business relationship,
but bro, you're always fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can count on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also, this is not official,
but Mike is my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is my, I know that's not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is not credited to be a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mike is my free lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my free lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other lawyer costs like $2,000 an
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can call Mike and go, Hey, can you
answer this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I need to call the expensive guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The screening questions like, Hey,
here's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have to call the real lawyer and pay
him or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I call the Italian guy or do I fucking
talk to you about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Mike can answer half the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ladies and gentlemen is how Mike
got his name, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it as a joke because he's just such
a white guy, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Parker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wears a genco.
[SPEAKER_02]: He listens to fucking 311.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I have weed in the car and I go
fast, he says, buddy, decide if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to have weed or go fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break one law at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're going to break a law one at
a time, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the reasons that make you white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every guy, I'm kind of a rebel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of a loose cannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget sometimes that I'm smoking a
joint, driving 90, talking on my phone,
[SPEAKER_02]: like all of this shit I shouldn't be
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike will go, Hey, slow down,
put the phone away or put the joint out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do all of this, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Oh, thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad you're in the passenger
seat because sometimes I get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking carried away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike became white Mike for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it bothers you that I call him white
Mike is all in love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in good fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how fucking pasty he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got him on a video here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see he is extra pasty right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, bro, he's wearing a beanie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got genco's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's qualifies as white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing racist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all in good fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where white Mike, the nickname
white Mike came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave that one to him because if I needed
somebody to research something,
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me about a law, fill out some
paperwork, some white guy shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike would do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a little, excuse the throat
clearing guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to blame that on our friends at
first matter premium concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out for the fatty dads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm crossing off all the shit that I've
covered here because we do have an
[SPEAKER_02]: extensive interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be a good interviewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, we've covered up to the point where
I met you and you became my bud tender and
[SPEAKER_00]: my bro and that's our origin story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I got to mention that in that same
time period, Mike got me involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis community, going to city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm trying to say city
council.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never gone to city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not have gotten politically
active.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would not be part of my repertoire if
it weren't for Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like that's where Mike shines is
on the paperwork, the activism,
[SPEAKER_02]: the well-spoken side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this jammering fucking bro talk and I
do the grow and the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be the cartoon character.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike does the white guy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he introduced me to the city council
part and kind of taught me how to tighten
[SPEAKER_02]: up my game a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where Mike came in in my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now where I want to jump to is,
can you tell us what you were doing before
[SPEAKER_02]: you got into the cannabis game?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to reveal too much that
you're not comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you doing before the weed game,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far back should I go?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as you're comfortable, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, the day you were born, what were
you thinking when you looked up and saw
[SPEAKER_02]: the bright lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Mike was born in a lonely house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe let's start at, what got you smoking
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What got me smoking weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I just remember everybody was
obsessed with it in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in, Jeff mentioned it,
Parker, Colorado in the eighties and
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents movement at the time,
the anti-drug parents movement was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs in schools were a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gangs in schools were a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, none of this shit really existed
in Parker, but they were fucking super
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoid about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and Parker is just a little suburb
outside of Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a few miles outside of Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real suburb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Douglas County, Colorado, for most of
my childhood, it was the fastest growing
[SPEAKER_00]: County in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to joke that we didn't have white
people in my town when, or we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: non-white people in my town when I was
growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the cops fucked with the
teenagers so much because there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: minorities to screw with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weirdly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super true about Parker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember in middle school,
we used to make the one black girl stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up and talk about what it was like to be
black in February and then make the one
[SPEAKER_00]: Jewish kid get up in December and talk
about what it was like not to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eighties were a weird time if you're a
lot younger than me and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sounds insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what we did to people back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the way through school,
they kept bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana, people are going to offer you
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I went to Denver with my
parents, I was like, what are the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: dealers at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why aren't they trying to sell me
drugs or give me free drugs or get me
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked on drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're lying to me in school or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just waiting for those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was sitting in the hall at
school, working on a group project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kid that lived up the street from
me comes whipping around the corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hallway, like power walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as he came around the corner,
he pulled his hand out of his pocket and
[SPEAKER_00]: threw something at me and it hit me in the
chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know what the fuck was
happening, but I had the presence of mind
[SPEAKER_00]: to flip my shirt over whatever just hit
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two teachers came running around the
corner right behind him and were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, not so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like stay where we can see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of like marching him off to
the office or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they passed, I looked down and
the two kids that were working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: project with me were like, what the fuck
just happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked down and it's like,
I know enough from health class to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I just got hit in the chest with a
bag full of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a gift from whoever you believe
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kid was Allah or Jah or Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, true story.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first bag of weed was fucking thrown at
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was meant to be, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to David.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad I asked how you got into
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows who he is, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up taking that home and trying to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a pop can with holes poked
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just burnt myself a couple of times
and was like, is this what being high is
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was God, years later, two,
three years later, before I actually got
[SPEAKER_00]: good and stoned in someone named Mandy's,
I can't remember which parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think her mom's garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're snitching on Mandy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fucking just name dropping on
everybody, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropping names on everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find these people, tell them I
said hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get hit in the chest with a bag of
weed and then you go smoke with some young
[SPEAKER_02]: innocent girl named Mandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandy got me nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the first couple of times I
got introduced to weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's high school time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighth grade and then maybe eighth grade,
I got hit in the chest with weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mandy's garage, I wasn't driving yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to be in 15, sophomore in high
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the same time most of us
start smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went a little younger, but then I had a
break because I moved away from home and
[SPEAKER_02]: had to find my new crew and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a new plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where I'm from, dude, everybody
fucking smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, it's easy in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to not smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got you smoking about fucking 15
years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke all the way through high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the time I was 15 through now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So college, all that good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That puts me back to where were you right
before the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of, I know you're well educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of education do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what segues you into weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in college, I studied sociology and
psychology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a lot of drugs classes,
drugs and society type stuff, drug policy
[SPEAKER_00]: type stuff, history of drug policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that blew my mind,
one of the first drugs classes I took,
[SPEAKER_00]: the class started the history of drugs
with salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where it started out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the history of the
spice trade, it's exactly like the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes total sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I graduated college, the goal was
to go work with at risk youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go help teenagers that kind of
had a shitty run of it, get their feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: under them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't turn into shitty adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and worked with locked up teens
for a couple of years and got injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was trying to figure out what I
was going to do after that, a friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine came down with what events eventually
we learned was MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just sort of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to do like four weeks straight in
the hospital where they did test after
[SPEAKER_00]: test and blood draw after blood draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was living with me at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called him the day before I went to
go pick him up from the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what do you want for your
homecoming?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, I'm fucking miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I want to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like clean the bong and have some good
weed waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was 2004 maybe, 2005 at the
latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado went medical in 2000,
but nothing existed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two or three or four doctors
across the state signing paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: It existed, but it was real quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knew where to really get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my buddy comes home from the
hospital and he's 24 and he needs a walker
[SPEAKER_00]: to walk, to get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a cane, but like the four legged metal
half box walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were injured at work too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you hurting at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: My neck was messed up and it was giving me
weird pain signals down my left arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my left hand kind of always hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always massaging the little V
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neck's not fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I haven't been keeping up with my
CBD THC regimen and the stretches that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do and the inflammation builds up,
the pain comes right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you when we're hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get the fidgets, you start
pulling on your thumbs and stretching your
[SPEAKER_02]: hands out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you go right for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a couple of dabs, you start
stretching out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I cut you right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dave's in a walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave comes home and he's got to use a
walker to get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get stoned that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was having trouble talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd think of a sentence like,
I went to the store and bought cheese and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd go to say it and his brain would just
pause and it wouldn't want to say store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he'd go, I went to the,
and he kind of looked at you for a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: and have to look down and the place where
you buy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, I fucking went to the
store and I bought cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just brutal seeing my buddy kind of
pulled back like that because he was like
[SPEAKER_00]: good at picking up girls in the military
and athletic and fast cars and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden now he's a walker and
he's struggling to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rough to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he takes a couple of bong hits and
stands up to go to the bathroom and just
[SPEAKER_00]: walks to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't catch it either until he
opened the door and he saw his walker
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting next to the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he looked at his feet and was
like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time in six weeks that
I've been able to walk 10 feet without
[SPEAKER_00]: tripling over my own feet and falling down
without my walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sits down and he goes, did you
notice that I didn't need my walker?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, did you notice you didn't
stumble all over that sentence?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both just sort of stared at each
other for a minute going, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, before like with more bong hits,
we need to test this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after like three or four days,
it was crystal clear that cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: medically beneficial for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put it mildly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we began like a year long journey
of getting him a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said earlier, you couldn't
just Google pot doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no Sanjay Gupta specials.
Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to find something to leave a
business card on your car or something
[SPEAKER_02]: weird like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were weird ways of finding
dispensaries back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent probably 50 hours digging through
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found some doctor's name and a
couple of lawyers names and was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get him an appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then it was a couple hundred
dollars for the appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a couple hundred dollars for the
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you got the card, all it meant
was after the cop arrests you and you end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in front of a judge, you've got some
paperwork to help try to get you out of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it meant then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was able to get him that far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could shop at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no stores.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing existed then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just you got caught with purely
black market herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were allowed to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow your six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no rules back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: None whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the original framework of
Amendment 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a minute to remember Amendment
20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took us about a year to get Dave his
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about the same time, my now wife,
then girlfriend, and I started to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: serious and we started to come down here
and spend more time with her family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her dad is sicker than shit and always
has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of those, his ailments are on
the list for Amendment 20 for a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been, you know, 10 joints a day,
keep the doctor away since he was in his
[SPEAKER_00]: 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you're fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we get you a card?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, well, what are you even
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started a process of getting him
a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took another six or eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I got him a card,
I had found two or three more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed help doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my first job in the industry was
helping sick patients get a proper medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said come down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was coming down from Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving down from Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 130 miles to come spend time
with the wife's family, the girlfriend's
[SPEAKER_02]: family at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the old man he's talking about is the
guy that I met him through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say his name, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years later, he would
introduce me to Jeff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how you got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were helping Dave out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you got Steve his card.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a couple of your friends,
their cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got yourself a card.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Dave now, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary just had a beautiful baby girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hearing that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You helped him get through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before the pandemic, Dad,
a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect timing, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to keep them occupied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to keep them busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to make another one
during the fucking pandemic, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got up to when you start coming in,
coming down and hanging out with Steve,
[SPEAKER_02]: how long until you run into me at the
dispensary when you start hanging out with
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve and coming down here to get
medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started coming down here for medicine
and regularly, like maybe 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be six or seven ish
[SPEAKER_01]: for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm listening to my baby monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just started going off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was listening to that while I was
trying to count back in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been 2006, early 2007.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew a couple of medical patients down
here that I had met through Steve that had
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have to hit pause, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan's calling a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everything going in family life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're still muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope little man goes right back to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no worries if he doesn't,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a family time and we can take another
break if we need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good at editing and I might not even
edit out that middle section there because
[SPEAKER_02]: I just talked for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the listeners heard all that
gibberish, I didn't edit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they didn't hear a bunch of
gibberish, I did edit and we'll just keep
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a good reason to listen to
this episode or watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking out how I look live, but see what
you was watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was rambling about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing a good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about how good of a job we
are doing as an interview team together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were we when Ethan cried?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I made it a point not to see your
kid's names on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started coming down here back
in 2006 or seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming down, teamed up with Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could just jump to the part where we
kind of met, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up fucking becoming homies
through Medamar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Medamar, my father-in-law came home
like giggly school girl excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll never guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed stores, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beck, it's such a, we're so used to it
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to check in with Prohibition Land
to kind of ground myself and get a feel
[SPEAKER_00]: for what it's like in non-medical
non-recreational places now because
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Colorado is the future,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we are spoiled and I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Texas in the airport and I asked
the lady at the newsstand for a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: copy of High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, we don't carry that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can't carry stuff about illegal
narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the future here in Colorado and
we have to remind ourselves of that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like Steve comes home with,
there's a weed store downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to go before the cops show
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to see this shit in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was blown away that the quality was
just as good as anything I'd been buying,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not better.
It was like $200,000 and I was like,
fuck it.
I'm going to buy it and I'm like,
man, what's with you?
I'm not going to sell it.
Like I'm not going to sell it to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to sell it to anybody
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was growing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price was also a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we got death threats and all
kinds of problems because of setting up
[SPEAKER_02]: that price here in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were angry, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were worried for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, we may have fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: people get to experience this in every
state that goes legal, but the price on
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a beautiful part of the market
because everybody gets to pretend that
[SPEAKER_00]: product is scarce to the point where the
price is the price or fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as there were stores where a
customer could, you know, without a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: bravado go, all right, then I'll just go
to the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if home people don't want to treat me
good, I'll go to Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that's a thing, the price ain't
the price because shit's scarce no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time Metamar had opened up,
there was a dispensary or two in Springs
[SPEAKER_00]: and then one or two in Denver and two or
three around the front range and then one
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time we had real competition,
competition down here, the price had
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 an ounce or something, a good $100
below.
[SPEAKER_02]: $280 or $320 at our store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below the $400 an ounce standard black
market price at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, by then the game had changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that number sounds crazy high now when
I said it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it used to be $280 if you were a
member or $320 if you weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a whole other topic we'll talk
about on another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was making the bottle just now,
I was remembering the grows back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a binder that had like comic
book, plastic sheets in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was photocopies of full pages,
the full medical marijuana application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your application, your card,
your ID, just so that if something did go
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, we're like, look, we've got their
picture, their doctor recommendations and
[SPEAKER_02]: their card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at grows when law enforcement showed
up and you had to be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: officer, like, please don't shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's go through my notebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trimming somewhere and law
enforcement showed up and all we did,
[SPEAKER_02]: we all pulled out our medical marijuana
cards and they go, yeah, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all left.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't care because we all had a
card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take this dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to cover me for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like 2006, seven,
eight-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the city shut MediMar down,
my wife is a lawyer and my family is in
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the city shut us down,
saying we were violating zoning rules that
[SPEAKER_00]: the city council hadn't passed yet,
I got pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told the owner of MediMar,
we've got to fight this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for various reasons, he said,
I'm not in the mood to fight right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go fight this myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're going to pass crazy rules
like this, somebody from our end needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up and at least have our voice
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at that point it was very much city
council and county commissioners
[SPEAKER_00]: begrudgingly passing rules for something
they didn't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've got a group of people
making rules for something they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like, the rules get asinine quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was terrifying the first
couple of times I went and spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first time I spoke up at a
meeting, I was on the front page of the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper the next morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an extra little like, by the way,
the nail that stands up gets hammered down
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe a year later, I was in a
meeting that city council had put together
[SPEAKER_00]: where people from planning and zoning and
people from the sheriff's office and city
[SPEAKER_00]: PD and people from like the water
department and the health department all
[SPEAKER_00]: got together to work on what rules do we
want for home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before the meeting got started,
the sheriff's deputy and the city
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics cop started talking about funny
shit that had happened with legal pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they mentioned the closing of MediMar
and that they had a surveillance camera on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back porch the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just started giggling because I'm
sitting next to these two listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh man, there was a camera
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many of my smoke breaks did they
get?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me rolling joints on there for
hours of footage, depending on how long
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera was up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can say just screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just time to go full force and start
hitting city council with whatever I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: they needed to get smacked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you went for zoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went for rule changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go for any sort of hearings or
proposals, but new dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four solid years of my life, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got me going to meetings, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took other dreads to meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there were a little section of
dreadlocks at the city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all tried to put on a decent shirt and
show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never gone and done that if
it weren't for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's awesome of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they realized that I could get 10 or
15 people to show up if I wanted to,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they really started listening because
that's what small town politicians fear
[SPEAKER_00]: the most is a little bit of crowd making a
little bit of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then the press shows up and then
it's a real issue that they've got to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with whether they want to or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were lucky enough to have a friend
in the press.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they would always make sure to put
our faces on the camera on the news there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had friends, multiple friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have a reporter who,
if we had a cannabis story, you just text
[SPEAKER_02]: her and she would drive up to the house
and you could give her the weed story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if she needed weed detail,
she would text Mike and I, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd fill her in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the news reports are almost close to
accurate because of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you've done a lot of great shit in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like dude, from getting involved to get
Dave a card from being my bud tender
[SPEAKER_02]: assistant manager, whatever you were at
Metomar, that was a stressful,
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging, ridiculous job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were inventing the rules and the
systems as we happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really interesting and fun to
watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had MMJ menu first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nobody had that shit before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing it on the black market kind
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like sort of inventing the
smell jars and display racks and
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had awesome displays.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dispensary always looked so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had nice good systems in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always trusted working with you
and we worked at that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we got kind of out of the,
there wasn't a dispensary to work at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we teamed up again for another
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we kind of worked at another
place together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been through three facilities
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me working in the back and you working up
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a lot of fun where I always try,
anytime I get a place or an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring somebody on board, if I'm in charge
or do hiring, you're always, I put your
[SPEAKER_02]: name at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: The application always goes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been a good fucking team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fist bump across fucking Zoom,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've accomplished a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a favorite accomplishment in
the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know them two little gremlins you
got over there better be your favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplishments, but in cannabis,
what's your favorite dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you pause or the video froze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when we got Dave his card,
that was an everyday couple hours a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: year long struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that first card showed up,
that payoff, that like dopamine kick,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sense of accomplishment was fucking
massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have it in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have it in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to go to jail and have MS
at the same time.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't imagine him having to go to
jail for possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been cruel and stupid
beyond words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to have that protection in place,
even back then as flimsy as it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: was just astronomical and felt really good
to have achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a silly rule and it don't
matter anymore because it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: overwritten by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got the city of Pueblo not to limit
plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like a three year long fight
where they wanted to limit it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to limit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just slowly and with reason,
like the city doesn't want to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: between patients and doctors was my whole
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And little by little I won over every
heart and mind one at a fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that felt really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still to this day, the city of Pueblo
does not have a plant count limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They limit you by square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state, however.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state limits you, but not the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always bitching about that state
limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, bro, for trying to keep
me, because for a while I was able to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a few plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'm known and people know where
the fuck I am and they, whoever they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the day is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say, who are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got another email address or they
don't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know their email address, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know where I am and they know what I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to stay one plant under the count
just in case they break off a branch and
[SPEAKER_02]: try to tell me it's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not a fun game to play anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss the good old days when you could
try to explode the basement, try to make
[SPEAKER_02]: the house fucking fly by putting grow
lights under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 is the number, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were good days.
[SPEAKER_02]: 11, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six recreational and five on the medical
card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go six.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting Dave's card is your proudest
accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that fucking adrenaline rush
when you get the first one not to down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to steal your interview,
but I remember getting my first card,
[SPEAKER_02]: walking into that dispensary the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, wait, you're going to weigh
it in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the price on the menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just order off the menu and I get
the smell and you're going to weigh it in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to weigh 28.35 grams when I
buy an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to wait in the parking lot
for 45 minutes wondering if I'm just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a gun stuck in my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to sit on someone's couch and
listen to Tupac for fucking three hours
[SPEAKER_02]: while they fucking play fucking FIFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get home realize you just bought a gram of
fucking basil stuff in a baggie.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I have a dream that somebody sold me
bunk weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gave me the weirdest fucking
dreams, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there memories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have legal, work on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, what keeps you inspired now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Dave settled in, you got kids now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What keeps you inspired in the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just seeing what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing what's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so much fun watching Colorado
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember going into history class
as a teenager and being like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully we don't have a world war three
and I mean, or a great depression or a
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's close to all three of those right
now, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, shit got weird in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up until cannabis legalization,
there wasn't an obvious like, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in the fucking history books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guaranteed there's going to be multiple
chapters on what we're living through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I really started digging into
like, wait a second, Colorado has legal
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of remember that from when I was a
freshman in college, but it didn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: anything other than like, good job,
hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're still going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But watching that evolve to what we have
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first set of rules that
came down and how we went from a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: retail dispensaries to 500 overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just watching the glass evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I've got this beautiful little rig
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like this had ever been seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concentrates we smoke now were unheard
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I showed you this in 2008, I'm going to
bust out this diamond again, just because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's that pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not because the container's fighting
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It knows I'm on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't want to open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rewind the video, watch that diamond at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I showed you this in 2008,
you'd think I was giving you drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would kick people out of the house for
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't get it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't get to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a one-time deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit the dispensary the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 and I got six grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in a little paper bag and I
drove it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2004, six one-gram jars of hash
meant you were a drug dealer looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute six grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of places, like if you're in
Texas, one gram of hash and one gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin are legally equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are just as fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weigh the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take this whole glass jar and they
go, that's 17 grams of hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy life in prison, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, Colorado's on a different plane
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watching us go from where we were to
where we are now has been an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hasn't it been fun to be involved in it,
to be a part of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll find a hash that inspires me to
finally write the book about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to ask about the book in
this interview, bro, but the book is it
[SPEAKER_02]: real?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It started so many times, but I get to
like page 30 and I just stop writing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take a little break and then I never
go back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put your book together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want my chapter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll help you write it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask, where do you see
yourself in five years?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just going to say, write the
fucking book, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: On book tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say on book tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other part of that was,
where do you see cannabis in five years?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the B part of that is,
how long do you think until we see
[SPEAKER_02]: national cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis in five years and how long
until it's legal everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I had a better guesstimate pre
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's going to be the same after this
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, every little facet of life
is going to get tweaked to some degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different, 2% different
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the minute, the stuff that almost
stays the same is going to be 2%
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal greetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more handshakes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wearing masks at the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying weed in the parking lots again is
cool at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got go cups now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have go cups before coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got go cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go cups, for those of you who don't know,
is you can go to a restaurant and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: margarita and a plastic cup with sulfate
around the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise not to drink this till I'm home,
Officer Seale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sort of like when we buy a joint now,
it comes in a little too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we promise not to light that bitch up
till we get home.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you serve food, you're allowed
to sell alcohol to go as well now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: For right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a rumor that the state was going
to take that privilege away already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they clarified that as long as the
sales transaction happens inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant, meaning you ordered your shit
through the app on your phone and the
[SPEAKER_00]: payment was technically processed inside
and you're not handing someone a 20 from
[SPEAKER_00]: your car window, sales still legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking arbitrary, but a lot of
those are getting worked on, including
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole bunch of them for cannabis
that they dialed back right away so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could do curbside.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit's going back the way it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to take a break, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear the monitor going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just finished that bottle I made and
we'll see if he goes back to sleep now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet he will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably not going to edit out the
last break.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just me reamoring for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to continue with that, how long till
you think we have legalization or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think we'll see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We should see that in your lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one of us will live
longer, but I hope we see that in our
[SPEAKER_02]: lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my take is Trump is truly
terrified and panicked about reelection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so between now and November,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis legalization,
it has a out of nowhere potential more
[SPEAKER_00]: than it's ever had before because the
person in top who can really push to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it happen is as panicked as they've ever
been and as incompetent as they've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: been.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you disagree with me, you know where my
Twitter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you agree, patreon.com forward
slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly think that there's maybe a
10, 15% chance that Trump tries to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization is a way to come at
Biden from the left right towards the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of election season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's just attrition now.
[SPEAKER_00]: More states than don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: medical or rec now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten to the point where the
DEA, the FDA, NIDA are all being forced to
[SPEAKER_00]: reevaluate their positions on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, like, if we catch you with it,
we'll throw you in jail is slowly becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of medical uses,
we need more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, little by little, we're
winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, I think I mean,
the prohibition latticework is crumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how long till it crumbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so hard to guess that now,
especially during this chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Society tends to swing like on a pendulum,
left to right, conservative to liberal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the last hundred years,
the roaring 20s, like sexual liberation,
[SPEAKER_00]: music, lots of liberal social
advancements, and then at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: center at the end of the decade with the
economic crash, things went super
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stayed that way for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we slowly worked our way back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then same thing happened again in the
60s, the summer love happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led us to the fucking Reagan era.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could fully be going through that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, cannabis has been on a big
liberalization push for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see the pendulum swinging back
on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could it fully could got a lot of
momentum right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anti pop movements never been as
ginned up and as quick with messaging as
[SPEAKER_00]: they are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a lot more powerful in the 80s
and 90s than they are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the remnants still have plenty of
oomph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still have the full weight and
backing of the federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that generation that doesn't
approve is on its way out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're too old to keep fighting us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the two generations above us,
the generation above us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The older crew doesn't approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: People our age, we're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to start expiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm excited for old people to
pass, but I mean, that's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batons got to get passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what are we going to have to deal
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the kids behind us going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have legalized everything
pretty soon, which I'm okay with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing is with prohibition,
once you... Like it's especially
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no logical reason why cannabis
products of any kind should be prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But prohibition is a policy is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bad social policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to get down to it,
the most dangerous shit in society isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly regulated and restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under that model, it's controllable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like frighteningly kind of creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you can order the parts for a
nuclear bomb on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really creepy story of a Nazi in
Maine who did it and finished it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason the terrible shit
didn't happen is because he was also
[SPEAKER_00]: abusive and his wife killed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the cops showed up, they were
like, what's in the sink?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, oh, that's his A-bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the thing he's been tweaking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's highly regulated and restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at stuff like narcotics
and they're prohibited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't Google that because your Google
fucking search history will be fucked
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you look at like when drugs
were legal, how were they used and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when heroin was legal, housewives were
drinking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A low potency, oral consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rent tombstone, Wyatt Earp's wife,
that's the drug she's hooked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of like meth in the 50s
when housewives were taking it to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: perky and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much lower dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the overdose potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their fucking teeth weren't falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no breaking bad nonsense happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure, clean, specific dosage, specific
timing to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosage recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with laudanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you really start to look at all
this shit kind of as a whole picture
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, the idea that cops are going to
stop people from doing heroin if they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like doing heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just doesn't make any sense
anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People's families don't stop them from
doing heroin so the cops aren't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at crime, across society
right now we've got things like safe
[SPEAKER_00]: injection sites, methadone clinics,
marijuana dispensaries, psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and decriminalization
measures are hitting the ballots all
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver just decriminalized psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: California before COVID was working on
signatures to decriminalize across the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the framework that put prohibition in
place is all slowly starting to crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more people are waking up to the
idea that these are terrible fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: policies that lead to all sorts of
destruction that we're not intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you really get into the dollar amount
and where it's going and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: funding with our moral high ground,
it's just fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put people in jail to keep them in
jail to fuck up their lives, to fuck up
[SPEAKER_02]: their futures, to fuck up their lives
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, where do you see yourself in the
future of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've come a long way, but we're getting
old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are getting weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do we go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a weird place, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on pause right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a bunch of consulting before
COVID, but nobody wants to fly me to their
[SPEAKER_00]: grow to teach their fucking trim coup how
to not to be idiots right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm mostly just hanging out with the
kids at home waiting to see where all this
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What most of the fucking planet is doing
right now, chilling out with the kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting to see where this goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, I've got one more really
important question for you, and then we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to wrap up this interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, by the way, you've done an amazing
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for making your first Zoom
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the best interviewer in my
opinion, so I was really comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: having my best friend as my interviewee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this conversation with myself a
moment ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to call you,
but the guy on that end, I was an honor to
[SPEAKER_02]: have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a really good job for your first
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important question of the night,
bro, and I already know the answer because
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been friends for so long,
but I've got to include this in in my
[SPEAKER_02]: interview here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite strain to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to go with the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, that puts a smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not something that's not
yours, it's got to be Chem Dog or Sour
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City Sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really close to the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grateful Dog is bred by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grateful Dog is honestly a Deadhead OG
inbred project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deadhead OG is a Chem 91 to San Fernando
Valley OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got a Grateful Dog select
phenotype, a Deadhead phenotype,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I reversed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called the seeds that came from that
were known as Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took another seed from that and grew it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I reversed the original Grateful
Dog and put that pollen onto that seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it made more seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds that came from that won't
reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of weirdness going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't reverse number 77 either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call that one 77 to select.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one doesn't reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could treat it with silver thiosulfate
and it won't cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really cool knowing that your
favorite strain is something that I bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I grow it, you always kind of
drool a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not just the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something in the genetics of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that herb in my head were meant to go
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got OG Kush and Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chem gives you that sweet stank funk
and the OG Kush gives you similar but more
[SPEAKER_02]: earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they both have a... Yeah,
it's just a beautiful combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't my original idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of inbred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, I'm glad that's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we should start wrapping up before
one of your kids starts going before it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets much later here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can the fine folks find you on the
social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Twitter.

[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I've got a cool guest with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make no promises during the quarantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I decide to record it like three
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you look like you got something to
say at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more of these video podcasts,
hit us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us you liked it on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check out the updates I did to the
Patreon contribution tiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some more tiers available on my
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be something that gets your
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and foes, that is all I've got for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
buddy, James Butterson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until next time, take a fat dad and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a fucking good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a fucking good job.
