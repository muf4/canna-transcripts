[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coop and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 710, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this episode on the
day it comes out, you are listening on
[SPEAKER_00]: 710, which is July 10th, 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what 710 is,
it's a dabber holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hash smoker holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little more about it in
just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I want to thank
you guys for something, and then I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you for a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say thanks and then ask for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last two episodes, I've been
looking for suggestions for a new strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred Flow to Arise, and I've been asking
the listeners to send me strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of great contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some really good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read any of them off
because I don't want to read some and not
[SPEAKER_00]: read some.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels like I'm leaving people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I've got a good idea of
what that strain will be called when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to release that here on the
show, but I think I have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I want from you, and thanks to
everybody who has sent me great name
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I'm asking for is suggestions for
White Widow crossed to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a White Widow girl and I crossed it
to the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any cool name suggestions would be
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send those name suggestions to me
at growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can tweet them to me at
GFYHpodcast, or you can find me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook, under the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, or you can follow me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Instagram's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, I use my other company name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the seeds are handled
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of great pictures of my
personal grows, my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post pictures of commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to post a picture of almost every
grow I get to visit, just because I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to share it with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check me out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got any recommendations for
the name of White Widow to Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Listener comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read some listener comments on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we haven't read the iTunes
comments in a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is July.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a whole bunch of brand new
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop the music right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll fade that out nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first iTunes comment comes from,
it's actually an iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave an iTunes review,
all you have to do is go to iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the iTunes store, type in the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little icon with my face and a red,
golden green Rasta flag will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the middle, it says ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it shows you the spot to click on
some stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: To rate, it says click to rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody, 62 people have given me
a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on as many stars as you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, type in a little review
and let me know what you think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll read your comments on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it takes me a few episodes to
get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let them build up, but I do read
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started reading them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a person who calls
themselves DoobieBrudda710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect that I'm reading this on the 710
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this comment or this review on
July 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just left a couple of days ago
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: While growing up in Wisconsin,
we always had a lot of cheese and not the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind Rasta Jeff teaches us so graciously
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very well-spoken podcaster who has
a good voice and outstanding audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom digs the hugs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great comment, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five star review and the
good comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude says I'm a very well-spoken
podcaster with a good voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a gift, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outstanding audio equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have got some tremendous gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several different ways to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main setup is a spaceship looking
device over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some insight into that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still a drummer, but I used to be a
traveling drummer and a recording drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job was to play the damn drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using a Mackie 1402VLZ3 mixer that
was purchased to be my drum mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was on stage for several shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drums would be plugged into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mics, run mics to the drums and then
plug those into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't plug in drums, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mic cords would run to this mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mix all the sound with this mixer
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then run it to my in-ear monitors and then
run that out to the house mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would run all the other instruments
into here and run them in my in-ear
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor so that I could hear them as I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control my own monitor mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had to deal with the sound guy
blowing out my ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was much easier that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the Mackie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mackie runs to a DBX compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the DBX compressor runs to a
Tascam.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US 1200 USB, which runs into the
MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there is some stuff going on to
make it sound pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a pretty nice preamps in the
Mackie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Tascam, I do, it's got
preamps in it that sound pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I turn up the gain just a little
bit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use the DBX to kind of just
filter out all the noise and make it sound
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to the audio compliment,
that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask how I make the show
sound so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Tascam USB 1200, a DBX compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a live wire power
conditioner in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because that's part of my recording
setup and my traveling tour, setup and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit I'm used to seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it in here when I set this up and
it gives me another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I use that plug for the power
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plug in my iPhone right there a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's super damn convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's how the show sounds so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I run it into GarageBand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going into the old GarageBand,
GarageBand 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and easy to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, I don't do anything to it to
make it sound better at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get ran through anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could run it through a levelizer or
something like that, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let it go just like it is and post
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the comment on the audio
sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that people notice how hard I
try to make the audio sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, bro, I'm going to assume that
since your name is DoobieBrudda710,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they say that I've got great
information and a super friendly vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give you good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to bring a friendly vibe as a
friendly hippy type rasta man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to put a smile on your face and have
one on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say your mom digs the hugs,
which is always fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, DoobieBrudda, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on to the next five
star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on June 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's obviously been a minute since I've
read comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment was left by a listener who
calls themselves B Cognetta.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the comment is hands down
the best podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show provides awesome grow advice and
is highly entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would recommend to anyone interested in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to provide awesome grow advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also entertain you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a jokester, sort of a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you're entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it keeps your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you, I paid better attention in
classes to teachers that gave a shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: connected and adds a personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than those teachers that are always
like turn to page 37 and let's do the
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always bored the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to learn from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get bored and turn the
page like I used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to be entertaining also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, would recommend to
anyone interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please do recommend this podcast to
everyone interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if people are just learning about
cannabis, recommend my podcast to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be like, Hey, do you listen to the
show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that just listens to podcasts in
general, have them listen to my podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: B Cognetta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the iTunes comment and
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for the five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, was this review helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click yes on B Cognetta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to click yes on Doobie
Brother 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your comments were very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next iTunes review
and comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person left a five star rating and
their name is, I'm guessing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Jab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Kolo Jab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left their comment on June 1st and it
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow or are into cannabis,
this one will educate and entertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a theme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are entertained and you're
getting educated and you love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for loving the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show loves you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for letting me entertain and
educate you for about an hour once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for the five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the next review?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left May 15th and it's left
by a person who calls themselves John
[SPEAKER_00]: Funky Town Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is One Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they left a five star rating
and the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love finding new grow and cannabis
related podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for taking time to make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please check me out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they give their Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you were smooth enough to sneak
that in there, I think I may have read
[SPEAKER_00]: this comment before now that I see that or
somebody else did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you're smooth enough to sneak it
in there, it's Dakind Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: D-A-K-I-N-D Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just got a free plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to follow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In his review, he also says, thanks for
taking the time to make the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking the time to leave me a
good review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people check you out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better be clicking like on all of my
picks after this one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to our next five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the last one for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting bored with the
reviews, we're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left on May 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left by somebody who calls
themselves Live Lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Truly Iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polite, informed and medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is a must listen whenever,
whether you are in trim jail, driving or
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cubicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Ross DeGeoff for the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude says I'm polite and I'm
informed and I'm medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things I would agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be a dickhead sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my comedian mouth and mind gets ahead
of me, but I try to be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay informed and educated with
cannabis and medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am highly medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the seven 10 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm certainly medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is a must listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you must listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, you must also tell your friends to
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say whether you're in trim
jail, which you guys, if you've never been
[SPEAKER_00]: to trim jail, that means when you're
trimming and you've just been trimming and
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming and trimming for hours,
we've got people that we pay to trim and
[SPEAKER_00]: they trim for eight hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that looks like jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in trim jail or if you're
driving, driving is where I listen to most
[SPEAKER_00]: of my podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in a cubicle, this is the
show to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dude says thanks Ross DeGeoff for
the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sharing the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like it would be safe to
learn this much and not spread it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like my return.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been given a couple of gifts and I
like to put them back out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the cool compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for appreciating the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like you're in trim jail quite
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for doing what you do for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll think it's weird when I'm like,
hey, LiveLime said give you a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be like, what the fuck is that
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be awkward for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for leaving
iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if you want to leave an iTunes
review, simply go to iTunes, find the
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes store, search for the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the middle, it says ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you can figure out the rest from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody has given me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 62 five star reviews up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's move forward
with the show a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of the show, I told you that I
was going to talk a little bit about 710
[SPEAKER_00]: and the meaning and of course the origin
of the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what 710 is,
710 is the dab smoker holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is when you're supposed to smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phrase coined by my friend Adam
Ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always says 710 is the new 420 and I
agree with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is 710 all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a few seconds here and explain
it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if you turn the number 710
upside down, it says oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 710 became the time to smoke oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody was smoking weed at 420 and
then all the big hash craze came along and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone started taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody, and we'll talk about who
in just a couple of seconds, somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: decided that 710, since it was oil upside
down, 710 in the evening, or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like me, 710 in the morning, or both if
you're like me, I guess, was the best time
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 710 upside down or oil upside down is
710.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much where it originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing I can tell you is that 710
is not the temperature of your e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people said 710 is the perfect
temp for your e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be for your e-nail, but it is not
for all e-nails and I'm gonna rant for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second on why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an e-nail with a box with a
number on it that is sending something
[SPEAKER_00]: down a cable to a coil that is attached to
a nail that has got to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your box that has a number on it
doesn't need to have a number on it.
It doesn't need to have a number on it.
It doesn't need to have a number on it.
It doesn't need to have a number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you just put that coil on a
quartz nail, on a titanium nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you wrapped it around your finger,
all it knows is that that coil needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up to about a certain temperature
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not, in most e-nails that I am
aware of, there is not a thermostat in
[SPEAKER_00]: that coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sending a frequency, an amount of
electricity through that coil and that
[SPEAKER_00]: much power at the end of it is causing
that much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not, it's not like a range on your
stereo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a specific measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you know that when your
car, when you turn the car stereo up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 23, it sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go up to like 29, it starts to
crackle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit 32, it sounds like total
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each e-nail will have its own adjusting
range where it will be perfect and not all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them will dial in at 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: My e-nail that I use from Giddy up in the
G-nail, depending on which nail I put on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I need to adjust it anywhere from
around 600 to 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use the highly educated, which one is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the H-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the old school e-nail insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use that one, that one, I need to put
it down in the like 650s.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use the new one with the quartz dish
and that big titanium shroud, I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: crank that fucker up closer to 800 because
all the extra stuff, the nail ahead is
[SPEAKER_00]: much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your box, your e-nail box does not know
the surface on the temperature on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that 710 is the
temperature on the surface of the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I stuttered so many times trying to
say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got my point across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not what 710 means.
[SPEAKER_00]: What 710 means is oil upside down and it's
time to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit how it
originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to somebody I
feel is highly responsible for many
[SPEAKER_00]: advances in our current hash culture in
the 710 movement and dab culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our ability to smoke dabs, a true
innovator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a musical artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes titanium nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: He now makes quartz nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the originator of the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I owe a huge shout out to Task
Rock of highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, Task Rock and
the guy from Healthstone Glass and the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: from BHO Clothing came up with the idea
for 710 and Task Rock is the person who
[SPEAKER_00]: coined the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 710 to everybody in the dab
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody take a big fat dab right now and
give some praise to Task.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to grab a dabber right
now and I'm going to heat myself up a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a dab with you guys on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't dab on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do it during a break or
something because I've been coughing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what, it's 710 and we're
going to dab for Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I am dabbing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this Lemon Jeffery High Turpene Full
Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dunk the dab into here and give it a
little swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then next time we'll smoke some of this
Lemon Jeffery High Cannabinoid Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum Extract with a high turp dumped
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now let's get down on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat the nail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting the Hitman, the little
hammerhead perk with the yellow logo on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got the highly educated nail
that's got the titanium base with the
[SPEAKER_00]: screw on quartz dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go and heat up a fat dab or heat
up the nail for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm using this super dope coil
condenser decorated torch to heat up the
[SPEAKER_00]: nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you hear that ridiculous
noise from the torch in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going whoosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes that's what you got to do
for a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to heat it till it glows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, we're going to do two
things here in honor of Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit this fucker while it's
glowing red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mickey Martin, hashtag glow
squad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab with me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, that's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it when it's real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better if you let it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps taste better if you let it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I get something different
when I go in super hot like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what I was talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't dab on the show because it makes
me ramble and it makes me all dumb for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 710, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my body's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was for Mickey Martin and Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm back on my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which direction do we want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do something important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across this just a couple of days
ago, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us use pesticides in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in Colorado, Washington,
or Oregon, or any of the states that have
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated legalized cannabis grows,
there are lists of pesticides that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: and are not allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those pesticides have been approved
or disapproved for multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, anything approved for tobacco has
been approved for use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst the things that have been approved
for cannabis is azotrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are allowed to use azotrol in a
recreational grow if used appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I'm trying to cough off that
dab without coughing into the mic too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so azotrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trusted in azotrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trust in the Department of Ag to do
their inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trust in these companies to put things
in the bottle that they say is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: On June 28th, the Oregon Department of
Agriculture released the following
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is already hinting at is that
there is shit in the bottle that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: told us about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and read the rest of the
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture has
ordered stoppage of sale and distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of two pesticide products manufactured by
PBI Gordon Corporation after finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of several pesticide active
ingredients not listed on the product
[SPEAKER_00]: label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azotrol hydrobotanical insecticide and
azotrol EC insecticide are labeled for use
[SPEAKER_00]: on ornamental, food, and feed crops as an
insecticide, insect growth regulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: and repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products may also be used in the
production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both products list the active ingredient
azotiractin, derived from neem seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and may be identified by the EPA
registration number 2217-836.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products are listed for organic use by
the Organic Materials Review Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as OMRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the Oregon Department of
Agriculture is asking growers who may have
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased the pesticide product to refrain
from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Department of Agriculture's actions
came following an investigation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and laboratory analysis found the
presence of the pesticide active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the Oregon Department of
Agriculture is asking growers who may have
purchased the pesticide product to refrain
from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: is asking growers who may have purchased
the pesticide active ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: to refrain from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture is
asking
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who may have purchased the
pesticide active ingredient to refrain
[SPEAKER_00]: from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order calls for the company to
immediately cease all sales, offers of
[SPEAKER_00]: sale, or other distribution of the product
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture is
asking growers who may have purchased the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide active ingredient to refrain
from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture is
asking growers who may have purchased the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide active ingredient to refrain
from using it.
The Oregon Department of Agriculture is
asking growers who may have purchased the
pesticide active ingredient to refrain
from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture is
asking for additional information and
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a number to contact the Oregon
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give out their phone
number here on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may result in trolling and we don't
need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ladies and gentlemen, if you're using
Azetrol because you think it is semi-safe
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's much more gentle than a lot of
products that are out there, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Azetrol before a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using Azetrol, you may want to
reconsider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a whole bunch of it,
you might not want to use it for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while until they get this figured out and
find out which batches were adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know pesticides are expensive and if
you've bought a bunch of this stuff for
[SPEAKER_00]: your commercial grow or whatever,
it's going to be hard to set that money
[SPEAKER_00]: aside and buy another product,
but you've got some thinking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in Oregon, you can't use it
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in Colorado, I don't think
you're able to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using Azetrol and you can't
replace it, just run out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do run out, buy Azimax and
just don't buy any more Azetrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what state you're in,
I wouldn't risk it because you're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting one thing and they're
selling you another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't risk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go get Azimax or Evergreen or get
them both and switch between Azimax and
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll really solve your problem
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea to switch up
pesticides anyway, because your bugs will
[SPEAKER_00]: start building a resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hit them one day with Azimax and
then you hit them the next time with
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen and then you hit them with
Azimax the next time, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to just do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just going to hit them with
multiple modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get the least resistance and then
your pesticides will continue to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the Azetrol buy some Azimax,
buy a little bit of Evergreen and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also try some Grandivo in the mix
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully all the other products we're
trusting are putting in the bottle what we
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're putting in there because
this is a little, this is the second time
[SPEAKER_00]: we've heard about a product being
adulterated and making people fail tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it doesn't happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in the pesticide industry,
stop fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, quit lying to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are huge fines and shit
involved in this because this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it says on the bottom, include misbranding
of a pesticide product, adulteration of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide product and making false or
misleading claims about a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like important shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could probably be some federal shit,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's move away from that and
let's move into an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this person, let's scan it
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this person wants to call themselves
Zombie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Zombie.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to send me an email,
it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read this email right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up Rasta Jeff,
longtime listener here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd first like to thank you for all
the work you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your podcast is absolutely the best
cannabis podcast I have found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're getting rambly by yourself
or with a full table, it is so
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love it when y'all ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say thank you right at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love hearing that my podcast is
absolutely the best cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts a huge smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like it that you like it when I'm by
myself because I've been by myself lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been recording late at night for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when I can find the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it that you like it when I
ramble because bro, I have been getting
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking rambly lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on with the email a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go on to say, so with the obligatory
praise out of the way, I have several
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is a travel nurse and we are going
to Boulder for our next contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got married in Colorado and we love
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That state we have been considering buying
a house in Pueblo, but not, but have not
[SPEAKER_00]: had a chance to come there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you would be able to steer us
in the right direction as far as areas to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid and possibly areas to look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's hard to give honest advice and
opinions about a place when you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: negative things to say and you've got to
live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that a lot of people already
know what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come here and you plan to move
here, I would not recommend you move to
[SPEAKER_00]: the East side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every town's got its shitty side and the
East side has a reputation for being the
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty side of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there are good things on the East
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really cool skate park.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is good shit over there,
but certain parts of the East side,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not want to fuck around in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also parts of the West side that
I would not recommend you fuck around in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, most of the town is
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on your preference and
your income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're trying to buy or if you're
trying to rent, it kind of depends on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be right downtown,
that's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a little more expensive
and you're not going to have any parking,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's how it goes wherever you live
downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be away from the people,
I would recommend Pueblo County,
[SPEAKER_00]: like unincorporated Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow rules are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxes are cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something a little more,
it's kind of a little more privacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little newer, a little more modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another city, it is 15 minutes
West of Pueblo and it's called Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: West.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get really big giant houses out
there with a little more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more expensive than Pueblo,
but it's also cleaner, safer and nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less traffic and it's more of a
little upscale kind of a vibe and a more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive kind of a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can complain about Pueblo is
there's no fucking food here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around nine o'clock, if you're hungry
after eight thirty nine, maybe 10 o'clock,
[SPEAKER_00]: good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no food to be had here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those shitty burrito places,
those places that they have everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mexican food places that are open
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're like me, you don't really
prefer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one place around here that I will
eat at that's a little Mexican place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It closes at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the food shuts down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of good food chains
here, but they're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk a lot of shit about
Pueblo, Colorado, but it is really
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is really putting a big
change on this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis brings business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business brings money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money brings people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People bring more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making a huge change here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I would stay off the east side
if you're trying to move here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts of the west side are shitty,
decent places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The south side is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regency is not a bad area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The houses are a good size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too far from schools and shopping
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right off of Pueblo Boulevard so you
can get everywhere quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too far from I-25 and Highway 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regency is a pretty decent area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think University Park on the north side
is a pretty nice area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The north side is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Camino on the south side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to buy a house,
El Camino is a good area to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-large house right now because a lot
of people are moving out and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrading to larger houses, leaving the
houses in El Camino available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the notes I wrote down for
housing recommendations in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Pueblo is too small, a lot of people
feel trapped in a small town like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of food here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an older town with a different type
of mentality that is evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting there, but it's not quite
there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me why I don't leave here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I'm proud of it and I see
potential and I see what's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for so long that I feel
like I can't abandon the city that let me
[SPEAKER_00]: be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've flourished as a person here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really became what I am here in Pueblo,
Colorado, so I can't abandon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm watching it become something and I'm
proud of this little place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not for you, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too small for you, if it's not
your thing, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people leave here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a slightly aggressive vibe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a steel mill and shit like that,
but it's just a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hardworking, steel-toed boots,
leather jacket kind of a vibe here with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into a bigger city, Colorado
Springs is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more military vibe,
but it's got more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get food after nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all of the restaurants you can
think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the stores, they're all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the Pueblo stores, we get the
smaller version of all the stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's just small bullshit complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me move on with this email
because there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, also, while there's no
shortage of dispensaries where I'll be,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last time I visited, quality varied
widely from location to location.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your current recommendation for
best quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, since I work for Three
Rivers, I'm going to say that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you go to Three Rivers in
Pueblo, Colorado and you shop on the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to burp into the microphone again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk into Three Rivers,
you can go left or you can go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two windows to walk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The left window is recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right window is medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a medical card,
anybody 21 and over with an ID can shop
[SPEAKER_00]: over there on the recreational side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is great product there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product is not grown in my facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product is grown by a good friend of
mine, and I trust that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who grows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown with the same methods and
techniques as my grow, just in another
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't make it to Pueblo,
I would check out the recreational side of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind Love in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have a lot of other
recommendations in Denver because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: shop at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to a lot of dispensaries
because I am mostly self-developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly self-sufficient, and I don't
have to do a lot of shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do shopping, I just go by extracts,
and I usually go to Apothecary for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality will vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one strange thing is from batch to
batch, from vendor to vendor, stuff will
[SPEAKER_00]: be so different sometimes, and sometimes
it's hard to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your best bet would be to go to
Three Rivers and go to the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: side there, or go to Kind Love in Denver
and get product there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Colorado Springs, it is all
medical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're going to be in
Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your email says that you're going to
Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not too familiar with dispensaries in
Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend going to Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Download Weedmaps on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up Weedmaps and check out the reviews
on dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if there's a certain strain you're
looking for or something, maybe that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: help you decide which dispensary to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, you can tell when you drive by
a dispensary if it's somewhere you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a feeling at a dispensary,
like, fuck this place, or, ooh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, you don't have to shop
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot more to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the same way that people
choose their liquor stores or their bar
[SPEAKER_00]: that they drink at or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose our dispensaries very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either love it or hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love it, you go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hate it, you don't go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into one and don't be afraid to walk
out without spending any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be like, all right,
man, I don't see what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may act weird to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may act like you wasted their time,
but you did not waste anybody's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found out what you needed to find out,
which is their products are not what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not required to spend anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not expected to spend money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Target or Walmart,
you can walk in and not find what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, and then you can leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same thing at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're in Boulder, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there's more to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, assuming I get a Colorado life,
I'm not going to be able to get a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: license right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is the process for getting a
medical marijuana card?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you move here, you'll get an ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is that ID, and then
immediately you can go to the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part of that may be setting
the appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places can get you in right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some doctors are pretty backed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on if you can find a place
to get you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places they'll get you in that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get you in that day, they will
fill out your paperwork for you online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do an online registration,
which I'm sure you can, it just takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of clicks, you will have your
medical marijuana card within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did it, my card was approved,
and I was able to digitally print off my
[SPEAKER_00]: renewed card within 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 12 hours later, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned it in at like two o'clock,
and like two o'clock that morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email saying, hey, you've got
your card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't be too long, I don't
think, for a brand new card registering
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could be like as quickly from
having your license, getting the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: appointment, maybe the harder part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see the doc, I think 48 hours
from there, you should have a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise you that, but for a
renewal, that's all it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a brand new card, I don't think it
should be much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to wrap up the email, our friend
Zombie says, obviously, I'd love to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: you and your crew and dab the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, who wouldn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wouldn't want to come dab with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, you guys, come dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do a grow from your heart dab
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, but short of that,
any help with the above questions would be
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, one love from the Zombie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, I hope I answered all of your
questions thoroughly and appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I sparked more any questions,
just send me an email and I will answer
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little more for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, when you come to Colorado,
if you can come down to Pueblo and visit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some dabs, I've got some turps,
I've got a clean rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a cool voice and some shit
to say, I've also got another microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put you on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the email, dude.

[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back
Thursday with the Throwback Thursday
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, I'll be back Monday
with a brand new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a safe and fun 710
taking dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Alaska
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: 710, a big disaster in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bombs are going off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We whip the batter till it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it tends to chip the shatter in my
eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mikes, I'm set to scorch, but get the dome
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm a vector torch and the
microphone's a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the truth, all you liars go to hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I grab the mic, it's like a
giant show and tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've been doing this since way
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to get A's until I blazed them,
my great slack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went to college and acknowledged that I
hated that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make
it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the way you act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut the jealous crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's fishy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I smell a rat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we ain't got to tell them that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's leave them at the front door yelling
at the welcome mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get another dab pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same routine, slightly different from the
last track.
[SPEAKER_01]: A million songs about we, but where the
dabs at?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't like my dabbing songs,
you can kiss my ass crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop another huge bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420 game, 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Upgrade your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Downside your new bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite way to medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my fans, I'ma make them bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my checks from my bank account,
when I write and fake them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the paper stack, but I hate the
count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lumberjack, run a half to an eighth an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some would say that I'm stuck on a bad
urge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say those people suck,
like a fact purge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash sergeant, working the ditch,
then teaching the plan's demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he learns how to fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil up the butter pan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linus is the brother man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one producer, so I don't need
another fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But y'all don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, gap about money while we rub a
band every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I say hit the trees,
I mean up by the honey hives, chilling
[SPEAKER_01]: with the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck sticks and seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want all different breeds and
consistencies to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get another dab pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same routine, slightly different from the
last track.
[SPEAKER_01]: A million songs about we, but where the
dabs at?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't like my dabbing songs,
you can kiss my ass crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop another huge bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420 game, 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Upgrade your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Downside your new bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite way to medicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
