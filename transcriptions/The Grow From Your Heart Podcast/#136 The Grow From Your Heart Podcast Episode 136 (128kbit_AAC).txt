friendship kind of evolved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love to fuck with Adam Adams.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a construction friendship.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember, I mean, you were here
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of when... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave you a shout out on the show one
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you to fucking get to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I heard that one actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great, too, because we were
literally working and he walks in and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, hey, Derek, get to fucking work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sensitive, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we might have picked that scab that
day, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Derek just simply for that reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that... I see what happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just cover the hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not worried about the hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the quartz, you can burn it off,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another quartz banger over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another banger on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could shotgun this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's fill in the listeners on what
just happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dirty D took a dab, set the rig down
and just rested it gently up against
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's, his tea bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's perfectly carved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's got a carb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd it go down your throat?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that last sip?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it smooth?
[SPEAKER_05]: It went down like a fucking... Like a wide
mouth can or something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a shotgun keystone, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in college, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That Bob Ross, that too, right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's going to... There's going to
be people tuning in like, this dude
[SPEAKER_05]: shotgun a keystone before.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: My listeners don't know what the fuck is
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they're old listeners,
they might remember, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the girl from your heart meets a
trailer park police.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Summarize that very nicely there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam's going to hit the Hitman Samson
collab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask what this was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitman and Samson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what color that pool is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure what color.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like minty green turquoise ish.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a green label.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got green flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was the same one you've
always had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see now it's bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's a little clogged.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one's clogged up from the secret
session.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pulled a gigantic dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a loud noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't did that one yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the secret says, shout out to
Adam Mill.
What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could have been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put yourself on the list.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send an email, pay some money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't think any of us knew it
was happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, look at me live from the
secret session.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, Oh, it's a secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you know, we're kind of the
local Pueblo guys though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like you're a little bit more of
the bigger mover and shaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're down here down by the reaver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam's just lab kicking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just recognizable because I'm fucking
6'5 and have dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone's like, Oh, it's that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's my thighs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say your knees.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't tell people how long they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell them how old they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yeah, the day you posted on
Facebook, they were like, how long are
[SPEAKER_05]: they?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a child, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're taller than some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's definitely a commitment word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you worked at guitar
center, they were all like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're sporting the band down all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nipple lane fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to quit rocking the bandana cause it
was making my dreads grow funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I still do it occasionally,
but it was making the hair grow weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know all about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know Ryan C with dreadlocks?
[SPEAKER_06]: He had dreads way before me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked with him this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put them in and we were working up in
Slida, putting in phone lines and shit
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kept the entire summer,
like even when we were off work and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, kept it wrapped up in a
bandana and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays he's got, they're freaking
massive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably wouldn't even recognize him if
I saw him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they get so heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: His are thick, like a smokey, you know,
smokey.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have probably a new smokey, but with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Older Hispanic guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, then it's a different smokey,
but he is a younger Hispanic guy with a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of tattoos though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like having dreadlocks is like
having a child, but only attached to your
[SPEAKER_04]: head because you have to like take care of
them and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was born like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only a little bit of maintenance
to be done now that they're this long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get them tuned up by a friend of mine
about once a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: She does some work up on the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not much to be done past year.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing to work on.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I need.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need that hook, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The crochet hook love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that crochet hook in there and yeah,
some interlocking and some pulling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need someone to show fucking love
to this, you know, this monstrosity up
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, I, I've found a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, then again, it's like,
I don't really want you to shoot my hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'll show them and they're
like, Oh no, honey, I'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Inclusion zones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't, you know, like some come over
your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Google it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of wooks here in town or I mean
in Colorado, you'd think there's a,
[SPEAKER_03]: there'd be like a specialist, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure if you go to Facebook,
you could find somebody like my,
[SPEAKER_06]: my friend doesn't really do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to get them chicken wings that
time and that white dude was like the old
[SPEAKER_05]: white bald dude was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife stood there and he's just sitting
there telling me how I should fix this and
[SPEAKER_05]: fix that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, this old 65 year old white
dude, just sitting here telling me how to
[SPEAKER_05]: fix dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear it was me and you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going up there to get wings or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was, I've only ate up there
with the, with the one with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys still addicted to street
tacos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody leaned into Mike's enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude, I found, I found this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite place here in town?
Me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a vegetarian street tacos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make you some street tacos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to go get some vegan tacos,
I think the place is called coquettes in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the vegan tacos or the
burrowing owl.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want some good vegan food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I've been with you trying to
order food.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the coquettes served like tofu.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all your normal tacos.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the taco fixings, but then tofu
that had been seasoned and done well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinking mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like some tofu.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the, the fucking mellow
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: They replace all meat with a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: That place is fucking so fire,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that was probably the best
pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it wasn't cheap for my standards,
but I mean, it is in for, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I threw it in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody at the table didn't go,
yeah, cause you're a cheap pork head.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like $25 about a mile away from the
secret session.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little pizza joint that I keep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could remember the fucking name
of it because it's pointless to just talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about it and not know the name,
but it's basically the size of the pizza
[SPEAKER_06]: joint is the size of this whole recording
area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this little area recording and they
were playing like hardcore music.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I don't, it was fucking real
distorted, but kind of slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dude was mad and screaming a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed this before hardcore music
and pizza places.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a relation.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had to work near that fucking hot ass
oven all day and it's all tatted up and
[SPEAKER_06]: sweaty and wearing a bandana and it's just
fucking Henry Rollins in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a fucking dope pizza spot,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this little place was pretty,
pretty bad ass, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizza slices were two 50 for a slice of
cheese pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was added topping and like
certain toppings are certain prices and
[SPEAKER_06]: then your basic shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the slice of pizza was like a third of
fucking eighth of the pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a big ass fucking slice of pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for two 50, I ordered three slices of
pizza and I couldn't even eat the fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: third one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the cheapest date that I've ever
heard of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, have you tried a black Jack's tomato
and green chili?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's here in town.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I have a good friend that works
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to my friend at black Jack
pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got three or four friends that work
there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also know the other one of the
other delivery drivers there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we really talking about pizza?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got me started for high bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the homie at Domino's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pizza joints again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, that's what you got to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got one product, they got the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go well together.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have totally paid for pizza with
cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have something lined up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for how long you've been an order.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been ordering the one place you go to
all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's been a couple of delivery
drivers throughout the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a pizza place that I can call and
tell them who I am and just be like,
[SPEAKER_06]: can I get that pizza?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, we owe you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just show up with pizzas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't talk about all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say who.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I was discreet as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the one that way?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know which direction it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm going to tell you from
experience, that usually means yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just telling you that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to spoil.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I know is the pizza is fucking free
and delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: The driver comes in and takes two fat dads
and sets down pizzas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hand him a couple of bucks as a kind of
kindness to same same deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's back in his car and he says,
text me later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Text me any time, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ever, ever, ever since, you know,
the hash has gotten a whole lot better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely that helped the game too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's like, holy shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, it's it's it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually on my podcast, I can't take big
giant dads because I get all dabbed out
[SPEAKER_06]: and can't talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's fucking four people here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to dab this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dab that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take a big dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, I meant I'm going to dab all
of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dab all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a taste of whatever that package
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give me a taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need a big glob.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a taster.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're cutting into his big dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm cutting into his big dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's only like point three.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just ruined everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to get high over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried to do the play by play here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to cough on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think that's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a dad that's it's about the size
of a dime, like a little dime micro patty.
[SPEAKER_03]: A shout out to Ross to say it kind of
looks like Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to smoke you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to come to the States,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, visit us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to go to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You three.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't go anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a postcard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything in Australia wants to kill you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that might be worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn your mic toward you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a problem with not talking into the
mic directly.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's getting good at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think his first podcast appearance was
probably my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't speak much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when he did, he said, um, a lot as a
conversation with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I listened to your guys to the Colorado
podcast and he can do a show now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we listen to yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually do have real life listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I listen and I tell people to listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting to get pretty proud of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting going.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're taking your role as kind of a
leader.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to thank God.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to contain myself on this show and
not totally just take control and be the
[SPEAKER_06]: leader.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you heard our leader from the
beginning there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know we were fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely, I run everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just playing around, seeing how it
was going to work out and it worked
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is by the way, I'm Jesse grows from
the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure your mother is a wonderful
lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a fat dive and give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's going to think the show's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you say no, no, no, no, it's when you
say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to take your thunder there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a friend who claims that they are
going to beat me to the intro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm going to memorize the whole thing
and do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'll let you do it if you
really want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll say Clint, Clint tried one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet that was notice how many times
Clint's been back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, watching you do the intro is pretty
impressive actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: No paper now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just do it out of my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the sponsors fucking just kill it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's, I do most of the pod.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of my podcasts have been happening in
two takes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do about 15 to 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got hit pause and take a break by then
and take a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm doing it by myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to talk for a fucking 20 minutes
by myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this will probably be in the one
thirties, the mid one thirties,
[SPEAKER_06]: one 34 is up.
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually in the recording,
this is labeled one 35.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if it goes one 35 or one 36
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, 52 weeks out of the year doing one
a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's yeah, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a Facebook memory the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a just recorded my first podcast or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: This shows my show's a little over two
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a little over.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in the middle of April,
I think it was two years around cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: cup time or not cannabis cup time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right before it or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we, you hit a, um, episode 50
right around cannabis cup time,
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that would be about a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sometimes I would do two episodes a
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to have that much content.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was in the beginning too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it was kind of like,
Hey, I got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to come be on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were like, uh, it's like our
guest the other week when I, when I
[SPEAKER_05]: brought fetus in, it was just like,
he was my roommate and he was just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: hanging out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He literally sat and he sat down and just
signed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a friend named fetus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see how he literally like signaled
the airplane to land on the deck and then
[SPEAKER_05]: said, hold on one minute, you have a name,
a friend named fetus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's a little young.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, he's like, it's like a baby
type deal, you know, like he's,
[SPEAKER_05]: he's 18, but he's like, he's like an
adopted kid that is allowed to hang,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's like your little wacky.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's not my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just, every group needs a fetus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every, every, it's better and shameless.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nickname comes from a incident with
some acid and maybe a position.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I, before I left the house,
I literally dabbed him out so much that
[SPEAKER_05]: he's sitting in front of a grow tent with
it on like bright as fuck with his hands
[SPEAKER_05]: on his, like his head or on his knees
trying to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking six 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's fucking 18 years old, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he, he just can't stay awake and
he'll fall asleep on the couch and just
[SPEAKER_05]: like curl up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, that's all the older
that kid is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's my roommate.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's nobody cares from your ear from
Wisconsin, bro, or whatever the fuck Iowa
[SPEAKER_05]: and definitely not Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm fucking K bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's definitely worse places to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to, um, show you guys the,
uh, Mexifornia, uh, cartoon or Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, whichever cartoon that I watch border
lands or anyone see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still, there's some in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened there, Susan?
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want to choke on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I chose to leave it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff just stabbed Australia, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was definitely a, a point three or
0.4.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take dads.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you talk afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's more amazing to anyone at
the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we're all cigarette smokers and
we're like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was at a company meeting yesterday
and yeah, this is a peek into my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I was at a company meeting
yesterday at the, uh, the four 20 dab
[SPEAKER_06]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the real name.
[SPEAKER_06]: The four 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was the four 20 dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people go to golf courses or like to
brunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the boss handed me a thing of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, am I supposed to take a
glob out of it or just taste it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, go in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause everybody needs to get some.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then took a big fat chunk and tastes
pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everybody watched me take like a
half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what our work meetings are like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went to dinner gave me an
awesome business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though just host shut up, Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way too serious to be trying to just way
too busy to be trying to do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to ask if I was like, am I supposed
to take like my kind of dab out of this or
[SPEAKER_06]: like your kind of dab out of this hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause this ain't my hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we all seen that meme go around
here recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yes, I'm going to smoke all
your hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the person I thought of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can take a big dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've literally heard you ask, Hey man,
can I get a big dab of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like piecing two pieces
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I like that, that half of that piece?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we just hit that with something and
whatever the biggest piece is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, and I've seen you take it and
they are like, they're sitting there with
[SPEAKER_05]: the job and go like, it's not bad,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's who's next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at the, one of the cannabis cups and
I don't even remember which one it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was hard to find a place to smoke
at this, these older events.
[SPEAKER_06]: There weren't tables and shit like there
are now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I finally found a place and I'm
chilling out and this girl's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, can I join you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we let her fucking hang out with
us, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she threw down some hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes, here, smoke this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I did, it was a good size chunk of
hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought she was kind of, kind of
challenging me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I picked it up and fucking dabbed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she goes, dude, that was for everybody
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You threw it down and said, here,
smoke this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's so reminds me of a story about,
nevermind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, censored.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, look how grown up he's getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we haven't, we, we happen to
have another podcast just for that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: story.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sure do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sure do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can record that story right after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone may have had something that goes
up a person's nose and they threw it all
[SPEAKER_03]: down and someone misunderstood it and
thought it was for them and it was for
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done it with LSD as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hang onto this sweet tart.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was for four people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be a fun night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're supposed to portion it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may or may not remember April.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why you don't just hand people
drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly portion it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just keep it for yourself and make it
last a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is funner to do with people?
[SPEAKER_05]: Incorrect, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Incorrect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been day tripping by myself before.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it's like three, four o'clock in
the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when I want to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I definitely, especially here with
that sunset, dude, you cannot trip it in
[SPEAKER_06]: your car all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live somewhere now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was, oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He upgraded though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's got, I got the Impala.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I get around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can GPS track me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just happened to buy a car for cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from out of town.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if so, I'll jump it or throw it
off a cliff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is that fucking ankle away?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much so that they changed it from one
ankle to the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still, there's still a mark in the
other side of my ankle, like where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: been there for a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they first put it on, it was so tight
that it literally, like, you could see the
[SPEAKER_05]: little holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jesse might be passing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's been dabbing more now too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That little couch is open over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's taking a nap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking e-nails get me every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep mine kind of hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this e-nail, you keep it a little
hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last one you had, the little pyramid
one, do you still got that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, fuck that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured you would try to fix it since
you have friends in places.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that's an OG fucking nail though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a collector's paperweight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it blinks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could just run the other one on the
floor and just have it up here blinking
[SPEAKER_05]: and people would never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything fried out on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost went baboosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can get LEDs super cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It quit blinking pretty quickly,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it started again though,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: One day it started and then it went out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a very good unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, it was kind of first of its
kind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Towards the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sell e-nails all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the company that gifted it to me
kind of went weird on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just avoiding all that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went Mormon.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're Canadian.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I had to pay taxes on it because
it got sent over the border.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like six months later, I get a bill from
the Canadian government or somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, what the fuck is this about?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, you owe us taxes for
some $400 gift that was sent to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's called spam, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you sent them $400, I swear to God
someone got you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted just the taxes on the $400.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried to ignore it twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the letters changed colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know you're related to his
Imbobolian prints too?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got two trunks just waiting for
you if you check.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when it got real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They went from white to yellow,
then pink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like 16 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really care that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that American dollars or Canadian
dollars?
[SPEAKER_06]: American dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy, they got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have to get it converted before
you sent it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems weird that I was sending it to
Miami, but I mean, who knew?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sent to a PO box in Peru.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Canada, Peru.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some dude has just changed his name for
like two pesos and just slinging this shit
[SPEAKER_05]: all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the day and age we live in now to
where your spam folder is not your friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just leave me hanging with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I laughed at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get so much spam in my email accounts
that only the good shit shows up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: spam account.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I get spam text messages.
[SPEAKER_06]: People trying to sell me Oakleys and shit
on my phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you apply for jobs, do any off
third party sites like Craigslist or shit
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, it's all sketch.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll call you back and want you to dial
star six seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I'm not dialing shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you apply for a job on a third
party website?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Craigslist is a normal place for
normal poor people, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I'm sorry, we all can't use.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I thought you meant like
application services.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, you can't find jobs and cheap
places to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a job through monster.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the day of the age.
[SPEAKER_03]: I misunderstood it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut the fuck up, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, let's keep it a little more positive,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Rastaseb's sake, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Rastaseb's sake.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most negative grow from your
heart show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow from your, hey, go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this was going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, this is not fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the only one here having fun right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse, you had like 90 dabs broke up here
and there's like three left and we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: staring at it like the last pizza pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my own shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys take that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my own shatter here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you smoke some?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a couple of few dabs a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't trying to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard one fly across the floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Settle down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quit putting your fingers all over the
shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am kind of high.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I can't think of his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the podcast Jew guy from fucking Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Joe Rogan from church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you think it was Lee Syed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flying Jew.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flying Jew.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that laugh that he does when he
gets all really high and he goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the one of him tripping on acid was
the best one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did shrooms on the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I need to watch that then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the one of them taking LSD on the
podcast and they're like, this podcast is
[SPEAKER_05]: brought to you by fucking Nature Box,
yo.
[SPEAKER_05]: D, are you qualified to use that fucking
tool?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to readjust his position like
four times.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I?
[SPEAKER_06]: My hands hurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have done that for you if you
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have been.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have absolutely been your friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm handy capable.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then do your damn self then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's positivity for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff is now put the microphone against his
forehead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, see, this is the thing the video
just would shine through, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: for these special episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Video.
[SPEAKER_06]: This show would be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's fair that some people
would be able to see it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Abandon some people and we start talking
about video.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did it for YouTube for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, like pitchers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to like episode 20 or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: That takes so much time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they don't have a really fast render
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just me making the videos for damn
ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For damn ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hellfire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hellfire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took a long tarnation time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had never started a Colorado dope
show without, if I had never been on your
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was something I was wanting to bring
up tonight in some series on a serious
[SPEAKER_03]: note.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have one little subject I thought
we could do maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll blame part of my show on
like Tim Martin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Martin.
[SPEAKER_06]: He took a break.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there needed to be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Tim Ryan Acker.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Doe radio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Martin, JDR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm poking again.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of Danny Danko's show kind of
inspired this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Adam Dunn show, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then Adam Ill, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never listened to that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fade out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That mic control.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the survivalist show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Non non cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what other podcasts do you listen
to?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, everyone at the table is just a
fucking Joe Rogan, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to catch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to Joey Coco Diaz more than than
Joe Rogan, just because Joe Rogan,
[SPEAKER_05]: it seems like he has three of them a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bro, how the fuck do you do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I drive an hour or two and oh,
yeah, we're going to grow where I stick
[SPEAKER_06]: one earbud in one ear and just go to
fucking work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of unpopular opinion?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I should listen to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're funny word.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from their from cracked dot com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you ever heard of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Doug Stanhope's podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, they just sit around and get
drunk and take Adderall and talk shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus, I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's it's pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Doug Stanhope shot clogged
podcast for the guy's name that does that
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I mean, when you forget,
listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was like, wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a reminder of all of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all like tear to him like what?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can't remember the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can listen to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, wait, did I miss something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we talking about this right now or are
we talking about this right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Future me, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Jeff, listen to the podcast called
this, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: This bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fucking with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go back to the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm traveling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be sent back to stop Donald
Trump.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how that I just rolled all that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a three podcast and a release
brought up the 13 monkeys thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 13 monkeys thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that really what it is?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only 12 monkeys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the head in the box is that the
that's that thing you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the movie?
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I getting where did you just go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your you two are talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen 12 monkeys with Bruce
Willis?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he gets sent back to Brad Pitt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the movie I'm thinking of
with the fucking the head in the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a fucking number of monkeys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like it could have been that of
his fucking chair when I said Brad Pitt,
[SPEAKER_06]: he was like three feet in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like somebody related to me that
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who put the fucking head in the box?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a fuck about how many monkeys
you got?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't care how many boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just watch the movie then.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll watch it tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that weird that I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you just do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I dropped.
[SPEAKER_05]: I dropped butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked over a can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody fucking relax.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are thousands of dollars in glass on
this table and you knocked over a can of
[SPEAKER_06]: butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hell fire, boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have brought the soundboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even break your butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: My butane fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just try to do an air horn?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I need no air horn sign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they used to have the no stairway
sign to the guitar store.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a no air horn sign?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have an air horn in my pocket
every time I come over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a little tiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a sign.
[SPEAKER_05]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep making rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep breaking them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way the system works,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're not getting invited back.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not taking you anywhere with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why you can't take me anywhere
with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the prime example.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to walk out of here and both
of you are going to like whip off the
[SPEAKER_05]: belt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fucking stupid dumb redneck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go home and think about what you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll save the beating for the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get it on tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's just end this one and start
that because it'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're beating his ass in the garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff's got the mobile recording device
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we'll do video for that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're live on Periscope beating Adam up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying I can take a punch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe not from one of you big
guys, but I mean, Derek is about my size.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying he can't hit hard,
but yeah, you got a broken hand,
[SPEAKER_05]: so you can't hit me hard with your left
hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hit you hard with my left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm just saying I bet I could take
one of your lefts.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you want to take one of my lefts?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know your past.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not saying that Jeff wouldn't be
just as easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, at least he's skinny.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fucking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably just go, like that
whole one-inch punch to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a stout motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try not to piss you off at every point
in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, because I've seen you bad,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Derek, you're who I call when I can't
handle the shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Positivity all the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've thrown him down a couple of
times, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be skinny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to tell the stories?
[SPEAKER_05]: What, when he gets tired?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to tell the story?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why don't you tell your side of the
story?
[SPEAKER_05]: The look on Jesse's face is totally
different than it was five minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, who's going down in the garage now?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, he could probably pit me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first rule of Fight Club is you don't
talk about Fight Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit me, hit me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, I'm not going to hit
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as soon as he hit me, then I could
have just fucking unleashed on him.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I'm not stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did throw you to the ground and I
did pin you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat that, Ross De Seb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fight, fight, fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiss, kiss, kiss.
[SPEAKER_03]: My listeners are like, what happened to
Jeff's shoulder?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got him tied up in the basement down.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We held his drums hostage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody loves each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I mean, it's like a brotherly
type love.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've totally had to throw one of my
best friends down in the snow and rub ice
[SPEAKER_06]: in his fucking face.
[SPEAKER_05]: That fucking gang of fools you hang out
with, I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have one dude that literally thinks
he's fucking coming into the room and
[SPEAKER_05]: jumping onto the top rope at any time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like shout out, John Randall.
[SPEAKER_05]: For real, that dude is live and in charge
all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my trim dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He trims fucking seven hours a day,
eight hours a day with me, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven hours a day and screams like I do
probably the other hour of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I chop down trees and bring them out to
the room and weigh them and then fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: hand them to Randall's.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then by the end of the day,
I got a pile of trim buds, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to that kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want more of those episodes of
them like all just sitting around kicking
[SPEAKER_05]: it, singing like, like bullshit and.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, with the Terby boys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terby boys, Terby boys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do metric stuff ever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do metric all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you think of their cute little
message the other day?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Metric went down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to talk about that on a
normal, on a normal episode of my show,
[SPEAKER_06]: but this is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Metric went down for like fucking six
hours, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you couldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You pretty much could sit around on the
retail end because I think they use MMJ
[SPEAKER_06]: menu on the retail end.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they could do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The retail worked fine, but any of the
grow, we had, we were packaging a transfer
[SPEAKER_06]: and a large transfer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're in the middle of a hefty
harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to talk about how much
we were packaging, but we're making lots
[SPEAKER_06]: of packages.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me and another dude fucking a
couple hours to put all these packages
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so we put all the packages together,
they're weighed, they're in bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the marker written on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We go to do it in the computer and metric
says, sorry, we're down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we couldn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't quote it with this, but a stupid
little message.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it came back up the next day and
it's like, uh, we've had our, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, had our buds have been working.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been working our buds off to get
things back smoking again or something
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they tried to be cute about it and
they apologize, but they definitely tried
[SPEAKER_06]: to be witty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys get that wrote from a
dispensary out and in Peter or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just sounds something cliche like
they would do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a, I'm not, I'm not going to drop
any names.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't send anyone there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a screenshot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just must find, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, maybe I don't have a screenshot of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty sure I got a screenshot of
that, but I was, uh, I was tagging plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't think I was ruining anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Torching it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what Adam does at our show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also hold that torch closer to the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You told D you know what, you know what
happened to your face when you said that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think we need to give Adam his own show.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the fuck off the fuck off
hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think itunes, the rambling idiot.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, we'll do it with Asterix.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine for the rambling idiot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Click a trailer podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: 44 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, what'd you call your hairstyle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Moloch's podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Moloch's 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moloch's 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the, uh, highly educated titanium
fucking nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Baller dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That thing is so dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your dab is going to taste so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I have the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quartz on top.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little dirty because, uh,
I take the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it needs a little heat too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I heat them fairly the same with
the torch and pointed at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, when I asked this question earlier,
I got so much shit from everybody,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you see how these two assholes just
gave you shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said nothing because I've already
been down that road and I was that asshole
[SPEAKER_05]: getting shit talked about, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I I'm your friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't feel jealous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not jealousy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just jealousy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fitting in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You even went and bought yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a couple for free, but yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I paid for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just put it on my checks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never even see the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's literally an,
you know, I can't first rule by fight
[SPEAKER_05]: club.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the nicest part of your apparel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my shirt that I got for free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free from from Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, shout out to Jesse,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to easy clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking rock the easy clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a four fucking table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That picture you showed me was.
[SPEAKER_06]: What picture?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those roots, them roots, them roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy clone of roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy clone of roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get them.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of a rapid start.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of a and a little bit of B.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: An easy cloner and an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I put it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put an air pump in my easy clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put a little air pump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a little circulation going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more air, the better in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it frothy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing hits like there's no water in
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's so smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it's a dry hit, but there's
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because there's hardly any water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's literally right above the
second perk line.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've dabbed so hard that the water is
kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can see the old.
[SPEAKER_06]: The old water line.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it, Derek.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the only one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thousands of dollars on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because of my broken hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't forget to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, heat this up for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Torch off your plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, you bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little lumpa bottle on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to drip on your jeans if you do
it like that, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're dripping on to here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This turpex packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, your parchment's right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that big enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a little dab left on it,
but Colorado problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, hi, I'm right over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to do this on podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like if you hear the smoke
detector different now, if you're the
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke detector, that's just it's not going
to melt it off there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, heat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like glowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, I guess the turpex
containers would be plastic, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just going to be vapor on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're trying to drip it onto a zigzag,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically zigzag.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not zigzags.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some other shitty papers that
you're trying to pawn off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't trying to pawn off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave a couple of my friends samples of
some papers that someone pawned off on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was just trying to be nice and see
what you thought about them, because I
[SPEAKER_05]: have at least I like the packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the quality picture on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but I mean, come on,
when do you get papers with with it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: listening to Mandarin or I was just going
to I was just going to ask you how much
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking fucking monster energy drink did
you drink?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like being around my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, fuck, you know, like just to hang
out with these two bucks is one thing like
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then like you're always so busy now
that, you know, eventually, eventually
[SPEAKER_05]: does he just sound like when he talks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's literally walked in and out of
the room and I just kept walking and
[SPEAKER_05]: talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so have you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hear that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be talking and he'll be saying
something that suddenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've got to figure out like his
different pitches and tones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not a whale asshole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put him in a mix and just play music
underneath him.
[SPEAKER_06]: What key you rambling in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that'd be funnier than you guys doing
a rap song.
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you everything you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Derrick Kane like, hello, stay a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, like I'll give you exactly what
you need, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just you got to let me know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's scary when Adam tells you I'll give
you exactly what you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All over the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero.
Somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that the other week,
Jesse was saying something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was giving somebody shit like,
oh, you don't need to say that on blah,
[SPEAKER_05]: blah, blah, blah, social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My nickname 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero fucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, oh, you talk all this big
shit online.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jesse chimes in with no, that's really
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's that's really him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wouldn't give two fucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not a troll.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's telling you exactly is a troll,
but not just a troll.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one that lives under the bridge,
not on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that sound for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that was that my ego deflector?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a secret behind what you said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is it a troll secret?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, if I if I had a troll
secret, I would I would probably come to
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been you've been known to to piss
quite a few people off.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has one of the best ones ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not going to shoot myself in the
foot on that, but I'll tell you later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm working on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you alluded to the name accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't don't do it again, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already done crossed over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just be Jesse pulled the mic out of
the mic stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know that rapper holds a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's Jesse right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to try that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely not how we do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember seeing Zach Day of the Road.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not a trap artist either,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, trapping.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could I could I could introduce you to
one of those if you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying I don't have fresh,
hot beats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could I could.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds dirtier than it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really I got these fresh,
hot beats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the demon hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Save a tree, kill a trap artist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure why trap artists and trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kill a trap artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Save a puppy, kill a trap artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us how you feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse doesn't like trap music.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did your headphones cut out because you're
wiggling them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's I do a shout out to this piece
of equipment every occasion on my show.
[SPEAKER_06]: The LiveWire Solutions HAO4 four channel
stereo headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is cutting out sometimes, but if you
like pull on the wire and I put my phone
[SPEAKER_04]: on it, it's the connection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a connection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Riding an old here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the things that me and Jesse
literally sat down at the table and we
[SPEAKER_05]: both kind of looked at it and said,
oh, you're still using that piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is because I mean, we've been part of
that conversation because if I go to
[SPEAKER_06]: guitar center and I tell them this sucks,
they go, oh, you know, here's another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The upgraded model is the same thing just
with like a fancy plastic housing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fixing a solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get bigger problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use a like it's a four way splitter,
but it's all molded together.
[SPEAKER_03]: No independent channels.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the independent channels because I
like to crank mine up when I do my show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it up real loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, you got these phones,
podcast tech making that shit go weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's about to get a text message.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're all digging.
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked up across the room and everyone's
got cracked screens.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to get mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did crack a screen like a month ago
and that was like a hundred and two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that sticker on there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, this phone goes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what this sticker does?
[SPEAKER_05]: Prevent people from stealing my phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of days ago, my phone started
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had to go to the Apple store and
they charged me 200 bucks to replace my
[SPEAKER_06]: phone and they wanted a whole bunch more
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, I just got the phone,
the screen replaced.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I get some, some love?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They charged me 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's some love, you should suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's Apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking close today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try not to have my phone out when I'm
near reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got three, three hundred res.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three, three hundred gallon ress in a room
lined up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got two fifty five gallon
trash cans on wheels.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're usually filled with water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I've got another res in another room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try not to have that fucking phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a mop bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you, D?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know you got to work to worry
about losing your phone in or probably
[SPEAKER_05]: some, some suits.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got hot wells at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where we put the food in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a mop bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about my, or the toilet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever deep fry a phone on accident?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been worried about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the story I want to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Google it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's a YouTube video
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would suck cleaning that fucking
fryer out after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if you didn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure whoever we find, it's got like
some clear fryer that we can see through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, here it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a camera in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cell phone ruptures in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, is this breaded or unbreaded?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can dip it in some fucking breading.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, make that dish buffalo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buffalo iPhone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a nice revenge kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever get sponsored by iPhone,
that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If iPhone, if you want to sponsor my
podcast, Apple, Apple, Apple, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Colorado podcast 420 at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get enough sponsors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us have just one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a MacBook over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got an Apple PC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got three iPhones in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about equal to his PC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just get a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a MacBook for Dee to do recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need another MacBook for me because
this one's filled with photography and
[SPEAKER_06]: other nonsense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need one to dedicate to the show and one
that I could Google with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna need to research one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse needs one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam, can you use one in your car?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a PC kind of guy, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need the new iPad.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might put me above my tax bracket.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need one of those new iPads.
[SPEAKER_06]: That iPad Pro thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could go ahead and send me one of
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would use that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would definitely get shout outs all
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Snapchat videos from the garden would be
phenomenal with that new iPad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could do metric from the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have to go use the main
computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do metric from an iPad.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd help out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just walk around and do your plants
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just carry it with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be so much easier trying to have the
MacBook or something in the fucking grow
[SPEAKER_06]: with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like you need to invest in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on guys, go ahead and eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be starting him a Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you trying to buy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like an $800 iPad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably know 800 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you could put a jar on the table and
be like, this way you could watch me at
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You say we don't hang out enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll periscope all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, there's thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going through this every time I
drop something I'm buying, damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it has a crack screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they even harvested yet?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not gonna talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, shut up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him shit when I first got here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, so what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
no.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's such a vague conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very vague.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very vague for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not vague for him because we had this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse looks just as vague as him.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chick that worked at the shop a
little.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did that on a couple episodes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was totally a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to be like, shut the fuck up
already, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a big look doesn't mean shut the
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was like two shows ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look at me and you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've already said far too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to point over my shoulder to
show Derek where to piss.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, it's over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, just have a seat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right behind me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pissed right on Jeff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on the back of his chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said right behind you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kept tucking right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So crevasse right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't mind me, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear it on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're quiet enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch if we're quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you think so?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me set my mic up just right for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can set this up so we can hear him.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pee louder.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not gonna be able to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was funny though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a valiant effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably the weirdest thing I've
ever done on your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't even from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the show of many firsts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is excellent though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's intro is the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just kind of testing the waters and
I was like, well, that's going.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way I'm fucking editing that
out of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear us come back from breaking a
couple of weeks ago and he thought he was
[SPEAKER_05]: answering the phone and he was like,
hello?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dee's like, yo, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he goes, hello?
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the people that are listening on my
feed, where can the people listen to your
[SPEAKER_06]: guys' show?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on SoundCloud.

[SPEAKER_06]: And pee louder next time, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're turning the mic up your pee.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can our guys find yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: My show is available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get your show on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to help you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've even got an RSS feed now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The IT guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: The IT guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Put this shit up on iTunes, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've kind of been waiting for this
talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: My show is available on my website,
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my show is available every Wednesday
at one o'clock on Tocqueville.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't even ever heard about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to tocradeo.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a live feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just always streaming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Jay jumps in and does live
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll just play music based on his vibe of
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're a busy guy now, but are you
still doing genetics?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know if you wanted to plug that,
too, for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't have anything available at
the time, but I'm making a Rise F2s,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I'll have my testers bust through a
bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I may put some of those out to
the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely like Arise a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's such a good strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a really good cut of that,
didn't we?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like our number three or number
five or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arise number one is the one you're
thinking of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arise number five was really good,
too, but I bet you're talking about the
number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was number one that we kept
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was some of the early stuff you had.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got an amazing boy of that cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got girls of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to put several females
in a room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably somewhere between 16 and 20 girls
and that Arise male in a room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the Arise, the same male,
but two clones of it in the same room and
[SPEAKER_06]: grow them out and fucking hit that pollen
on all those plants and make between 15
[SPEAKER_06]: and 20 new crosses and test them all out
and see what works.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I think about that Arise number
one that we had, your male is the male
[SPEAKER_03]: counterpart to that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just big, tall, amazing buds, crazy
branching.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, big ass buds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Giant buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of the parents made giant buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that was one of the things we did
out last year, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in the greenhouse.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time we ran that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also had the Black Cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I bred Arise, I really expected it to
take longer to finish flowering,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I get seven and a half to eight to
nine week phenotypes out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like golden goat a lot there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of golden goat dominant
phenotypes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think golden goat on
appearances.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of growers, if they didn't
know what it was, would think it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: longer flowering strain than it actually
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That trait actually comes from the Romulan
in it because Romulan is from Canada and
[SPEAKER_06]: those guys bred their shit to finish a
little earlier and they found the earlier
[SPEAKER_06]: finishing sativas and went for that aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we were talking to Christian the
other day on one of the forums or one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the groups about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to learn something,
please check out the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse is knowledgeable and Derek,
he's got the years underneath his belt and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm learning as we go, but Jeff,
you've definitely had the experience for
[SPEAKER_05]: the indoor for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a lot of practice lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check out the Grow From Your Heart
podcast for sure.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys that are listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, the two best growers in town are
sitting at the table right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the indoor dude and you're the
outdoor dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way it's been on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was going to ask a question for
somebody, you're the person I would call
[SPEAKER_05]: for indoor and you're the person I would
call for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to be a part of all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm really worthy of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know too many outdoor
growers either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's an outdoor grower.
Apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant that in a good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone can be an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun will save your ass many a times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only meant that slightly sarcastically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff watched my plants live and die and
live and die and live and die.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first year I was here and I was
scrambling to ask you questions and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: telling him to ask you questions on shows
like, what do I do about ants?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I know, I'll just cover it in
dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that was the worst thing I ever did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I covered it in dirt at 11 in the
afternoon and by two, they were literally
[SPEAKER_05]: floppy plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You covered it with sand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no way for the water to get
through the sand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched some asshole cover it in fine
particulate sand that he bought from a
[SPEAKER_05]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people do that to get rid of
gnats.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pain in the fucking ass,
but outdoors in a root-bound container
[SPEAKER_03]: that is so root-bound it's drying out
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they were in earth putts, but they
were dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were definitely drying out every
other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were drying out every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, wake up and be like, fuck my face.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd wake up at 10 o'clock and be like,
holy shit, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that, you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would wake up at 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what I've done by 10 o'clock
in the morning?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are moving shakers and I work at
a pipe shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hustle glass all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just told me today, he's like,
man, you really need to try for your
[SPEAKER_05]: badge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I'd love to, but I mean,
44, 40 fucking 40.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had a felony in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you might be able to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of my charges until way, way back
when I was adjudicated as an adult have
[SPEAKER_05]: anything to do with any kind of drugs or
violence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a fucking dumb kid, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a dumb kid when I was 19.
[SPEAKER_05]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a fucking break.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think your 19 year old self still shines
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I play a good fool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: 44 is actually 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish that was true, but whoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't be sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I sure wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll learn my lesson on them 20 year olds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ain't even got a pretty mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we had that conversation early.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: This got really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in my next episode, I'm going to
talk about how to take care of fungus
[SPEAKER_06]: gnats and like soil borne pests and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my listeners sent an email,
so I'm glad that you said fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't use fucking sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, it worked, but I think it caused
more other problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It suffocates everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been growing in cocoa lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cocoa is rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cocoa is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are things mixed into my cocoa
because that's what we've, we've purchased
[SPEAKER_06]: it and we still have the shit and I mix it
in just cause it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: But eventually it's straight up cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've mixed quite a bit of cocoa in the
things too, I believe along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where we done the first run in cocoa
and then we were like, yeah, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we've, uh, we've had cocoa to
mix, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a run at home in cocoa right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure cocoa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, too perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's got a little form casting
some light in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what's in mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about it a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we both came to the same conclusion
too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking head cultivator, you know what I
mean, D?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mills, Paces.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have, I'm just giving them two
shits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Mills and, um, and OG Biowork.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always give him shit when he comes into
the shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: The, what was the last one he said?
[SPEAKER_06]: OG Biowork?
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Biowork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to do that as a,
like a base test.
[SPEAKER_03]: The OG Biowork crushes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've been using it for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been using it since it was called
Caps Beneficials actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you could order it from the dude on
the fucking, on like roll it up,
[SPEAKER_06]: roll it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that Overgrow?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes back that far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was on THC Farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn Pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way back in the day, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when he had to do shit on IRC?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't remember IRC, sadly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember IRC through Anarchy Online,
but that was my experience with IRC
[SPEAKER_05]: because I mean, I played in Anarchy Online
for 12 years, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was, it was years of my wife,
life that I wasted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just say my wife?
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that was so bad with him because he
goes to Benson and Benson's so on point
[SPEAKER_05]: with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, here, hold on, get a picture
with me and my wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to, I'm giving it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then my plan is, is I'm going to do
another run after it with the exact same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, but I'm going to add teas to it
once a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just see, you know, compare final
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing a side by side comparison with
two different nutrient brands right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, now your shit's cutting out because I
touched it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I touch it again and fucking killed it
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wiggle it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_06]: How about now?
Testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Test.
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit touching it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're running and we're going to retire
one brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what I'm allowed to talk
about really, because some of it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: confidential, but we're testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've talked about it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got Veg Bloom in one tank and we're
on week one, like three or what's today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're four days in.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants look fucking happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, but I mean, we're in cocoa,
so I'm sure I would see something by now
[SPEAKER_06]: if they were not happy and they get fed,
they're on a cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they get fed multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're getting plenty of opportunity
to show me if they're happy or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look really, really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been intrigued by the,
I mean, I'm an organic grower also because
[SPEAKER_03]: of the simplicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've always been intrigued by the
simplicity of Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all, they send you like four powders
and one liquid and you weigh them out by
[SPEAKER_06]: the gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's so much per gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many grams per gallon and just weigh it
out on a scale and just pour it in there
[SPEAKER_06]: and stir it real, real well and just let
it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just let the reservoirs, I put huge
pumps in the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: They fucking spin real well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The water is cycloning in there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you use RO water?
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's hard to produce that
much RO water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I fill you in on a little secret
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walmart has RO water for $1.59 a gallon.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go in there and fill up waters,
like gallon water, gallon bottles,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's 89 cents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water station, you can get it for like
about 25 gallons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm just saying like Walmart's are
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm not trying to pitch
Walmart, but they have RO water.
[SPEAKER_03]: 65 gallons this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost alone, Adam, of that is going to
be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're doing it yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I use a thousand gallons of water a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: A thousand gallons of water every other
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then we're in the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a fucking budget plan with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have them just back the truck in and be
like, use water, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's the reason I asked that is
VegBloom actually sent us a mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent us a two-part mix that I use
half one and half the other, and it
[SPEAKER_06]: balances the pH and adjusts for my,
I've tested the water and sent them some
[SPEAKER_06]: water tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent us a formula for design for our
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it changes across town.
[SPEAKER_06]: pH goes to six five if I mix it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Thursday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the tank was getting about halfway
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just threw the hose in there and
filled it up with water and let it spin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally six five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tank was all the way to the top and
it's still at six point five.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, organics great, but I mean,
yeah, it took time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sustainable to use one fucking
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four packages.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like our, our kind of a style of
growing to a very simple and simplistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the, this is more the round,
a lot of the stuff growing at green and
[SPEAKER_06]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used six bottles total on the flowering
cycle, like total, like, and that's A,
[SPEAKER_06]: B.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have like a big flood system,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That like runs back and forth or?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't, I, I don't want to give
away your secrets.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they're tiered, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just tables at an angle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flood tables at an angle with pots with
cocoa, essentially with a sprinkler in
[SPEAKER_06]: each pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it seemed like they were at an
angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a gigantic version of my little
greenhouse, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look good though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to go see that,
uh, go check out the CC four 20 on YouTube
[SPEAKER_05]: of the CCC four 20, the CCC four 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a cool little video tour of our
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also check out my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go look for shit,
check out, if you're going to stop,
[SPEAKER_03]: come correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it like click like comment,
say some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't just be lurking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need ghost followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the worst story.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that don't even like you shit,
you know, interact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost at 400, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow, follow four to four.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to get, I've been trying,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've been following a lot of glass
artists here lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I'm in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want them to follow?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want them on Instagram or what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Overgrow the gov. Overgrow the gov. On
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow this guy on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys overgrow the gov. Follow us all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but follow four to four and let him
know that you've learned from him through
[SPEAKER_06]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be like, I found out about you through the
Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's people that's
learning, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a stretch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that they found out about you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They discovered your punk ass right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them come back from the days back
from before you changed the name and all
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you helped me build that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plenty of new people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a hundred episodes ago,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I got a little carried away with the
Insta horse.

[SPEAKER_05]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying it was just a picture,
like looking out the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: My phone, my phone was broken for a day

I see because everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: do you see this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got like extra two hours worth of work
done that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like a, there was a Jeep and
like an older car.
[SPEAKER_06]: It only takes me three minutes to pee
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I have my iPhone, it takes me like
seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a dangerous place to have your
iPhone out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's, is that what happened?
[SPEAKER_06]: I put it away and then I go pull out the
iPhone and stand in the bathroom and just
[SPEAKER_06]: use it and check all my messages so that
nobody could see me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you go back to work.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hear, we see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn on the water like you're washing your
hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let that fucking water run and check your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, damn good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're wookie ass saying wash your
hands.

[SPEAKER_06]: I got to clean the hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not the feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the feet are fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking filthy, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wash them before I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't climbing into my bed with woke
feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: This ain't so mature anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like classy girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you go to cut your toenails.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be the last person I'd be like,

Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't even.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you clean your feet, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to look at them?
[SPEAKER_04]: I even got clean toenails.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro, I'm not even going to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to insult you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to insult you, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I left my sandals on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take your shoes off in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't let him take his sandals off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kept them on, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I respect him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to leave these greasy
footprints across my carpet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like carrying the hitters who just
walked through your fucking house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you walk through tar on the way in
here?
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dude that does the ankle monitor had
to touch them today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, they don't smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just look like crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks literally like I've walked
through a cow field to get here,
[SPEAKER_05]: bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, dude, you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't stink because I would have
literally told you to go home and wash
[SPEAKER_05]: that shit and then come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would have been like, dude,
I live across town, but please,
[SPEAKER_05]: please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have a sink or something I can
get down the way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, living in the car life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam just hosing his feet off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even that, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm strictly Jesus in it with bowls by the
fucking door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that whole deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to wash someone's feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes you feel humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The life of real life weed Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the life of 44.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a pump.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know those like, you know,
the pump that you would use?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it got stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one testicle stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not supposed to put your testicles
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure or do you know now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this after you were like, damn,
this really hurts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read the instructions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just blew every listener's headphones
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job with that peeking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got a compressor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a compressor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stopped him.
[SPEAKER_06]: But holy fucking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't have it hooked up for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's it's not on Adam level,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But between Sit back here and yell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Between garage man.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do your thing, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do my thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you know the pumps you would
use for like a water wand?
[SPEAKER_06]: You just throw it in a big container and
you just fucking push.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use those as stir pumps in a big 300
gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use one of those and then I put some
hose on it and then I run the hose to
[SPEAKER_06]: something and clamp the hose to something
so it stays in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could hear it slipping out like the hose
was creeping while it was pumping.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ran to it to grab it and it came
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This hose shot water up my shoe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shorts up my balls like I was like,
how did that even go there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, well, that was a little
undercarriage rent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking awkward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashtag Colorado problems went up.
[SPEAKER_06]: My shirt got stuck in my shirt for a brief
second.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to grab it and couldn't catch it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It slipped out and went back up and hit me
in the chin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great fucking nutrient.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got veg bloom up my nose like the water
was coming out of my nose and eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I could do was like reach to find the
plug to turn off that fucking hose.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So today I solved it by fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drilling a hole in the side of the res.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause then wouldn't the res leak if I put
a hole in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you put a tube coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did was I took a cinder block and I
fucking zip tied the hose to a cinder
[SPEAKER_06]: block.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'm gonna do this fucking
Italian style.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna get a fucking water.
[SPEAKER_06]: That fucking zip tied that fucking hose to
a cinder block.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just fucking tie a brick and drop in the
bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the fuck I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They fucking forget about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, problem solved, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They looked at me funny when I went to
Lowe's and bought a bunch of zip ties and
[SPEAKER_06]: some cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have been periscoping that shit the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like look at this crazy bitch looking at
me like I just killed somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't cross the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to get in the car?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was measuring cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, three should be enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this would like say keep a
hose down?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say if I really needed to keep it
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was life imperative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be real vague as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is Lowe's and you can't talk
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to be real vague.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the old man at Lowe's asked me what I
was trying to do and I said I needed some
[SPEAKER_06]: cinder blocks to keep my hose underwater.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's almost as good as it looks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm not even going there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to get going though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I don't know how long you're up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have a break and some music.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's going to be long apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to pee man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to pee?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a fucking podcaster
bladder?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting here with podcaster bladder
still drinking water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got that Joe Rogan bladder bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever listen to Joe Rogan?
[SPEAKER_05]: I went with you to see Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't let us up or order food or
drinks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was recording a fucking comedy special
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Jeff went by himself, he got first
class service.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did get put in the front row.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, yeah, pretty girl,
but no, ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got put like middle row, like right
underneath the other, like it was right as
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the, the, the audience stepped up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that, that step that I was directly
under the camera is how far back the very
[SPEAKER_06]: back camera was right above my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that cameraman had to view over my
head.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Joe Rogan was telling jokes to that
camera and it looked like he was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: to me all night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he did the vegan and the grateful dead
joke right at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty freaky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I catch a lot of shit for that,
but that was well worth getting in trouble
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of those moments that like,
you just got to say fuck it and go do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was worth it, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that was, that was a very memorable
experience that you're a grown ass man and
[SPEAKER_06]: you can get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, are you, you're still getting shit
for that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to leave that alone and
it's, I have to go because she needs to
[SPEAKER_06]: learn how to catch and release.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got no game, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I think you need to, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm leaving that alone too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: My life, my life, not her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got four listeners left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've all checked the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything was good to you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Invited that fucking redneck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What podcast did you send me to
hillbillies and drugs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did I just decide to play with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see why everybody plays with those once
they take them off their water bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen everybody else do it and
you're like, well, I want to play with my
[SPEAKER_05]: little water bottle tag.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my little, my little, my little
shower proof cap for my inclusion zone
[SPEAKER_05]: unit down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like me and this is Buck Rogers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I tried to put it on my other ankle.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your probation officer's name?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a probation officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bail officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your bail officer's name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me come record another podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoop whoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting him come to my spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you tell him where the fuck I live?
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 100% GPS on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you gotta go dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fictional characters, fictional
characters.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was all made up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all fake.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go in there looking exactly like I
looked like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, can you work where?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like a pipe shop, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sell people bongs, you know,
like, oh, strictly water pipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but anyways, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, dude, he,
he gets it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado was like, do you have any weed in
the car?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so yeah, they know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they, when they gave me my position
of cannabis, they didn't take my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my first question in the court
was like, excuse me, officer, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: on the day of question, did you collect
any evidence?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, your honor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, Hey, case closed in,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody laughed in the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they played the video and it was
like, Hey, honor, I'm just a grown man
[SPEAKER_05]: living in the car, trying to keep my pussy
warm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody laughed in the courtroom and
he did the fucking, the cops like,
[SPEAKER_05]: just fighting it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could see it on his face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you, he's not mad then, but he was
mad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't believe the fucking cops
showed up to court.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I can't either.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must have made some kind of impression
on him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't have a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, I'm the most compliant
stoner you're going to mess with all
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, there's no excuse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm smoking in my car, but I live
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in pajama pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: My keys are back there in my real pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like bro, I got my cat in my lap and I'm
watching the star Wars movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you should have went to jail
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: That might've been part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably why he showed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, check this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still theater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I watch it with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to grab a seat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we can go sit in the cruiser.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like bring your complaint.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm not going to drop his name,
but he was the most racist person when he
[SPEAKER_05]: got back to his car and thought he was all
alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that dash, that, that chest camera
still rolling brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I literally had to tell your honor,
we can, we can skip the racism and get
[SPEAKER_05]: back to my case.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, dude, it was brutal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, was he racist against you?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm white.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what, that's what I was going to
ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was his name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Officer?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go there.

joint, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name was officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all, that's all fictional officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fictional officer pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm retarded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

feelings?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, it is.

[SPEAKER_05]: We can play it over the loudspeakers
through a phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we have that, that, that we can plug
into the phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, but my phone sucks cock sprint
three G just saying, step it up to the
[SPEAKER_05]: game on blast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lasers fired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lasers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to let him keep going with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, don't let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_06]: My listeners have smashed their phones by
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've unsubscribed to my show because of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to, I'm going to try to get
Jesse and Derek to stick around,
[SPEAKER_06]: do another fucking episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you, I told you, I was going to
give you shit earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You sure I'm allowed here?
[SPEAKER_05]: You sure I was invited?
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of feel like it's just like,
so you guys still work with that fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: red net.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is exactly what I expected from this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no doubt that it would come to us
talking about taking shits and random
[SPEAKER_06]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know it was going to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know it was going to start with
us telling people to fuck their mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it was a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse tries to keep it like informational,
you know, like he tries to bring the
[SPEAKER_05]: information to the table, but I mean,
me and Derek pretty much ruined that at
[SPEAKER_05]: any point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, you know what,
Derek, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll rap then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've had, you know, we've,
we've done stuff with that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've just sat around and bullshit with
fools just been here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, why aren't we recording
this?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like those memorable fucking
stories are going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I would love to just listen to
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I wish we had a private loop,
you know, where there was some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: private kind of podcast, you know,
thing that you could, you could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay us $500 an episode and you get the
unfiltered version.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can totally make that stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado podcast.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just plugging all over your show,
huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your show too, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just giving a shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to get double penetrated
by our shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Devil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that counts.
[SPEAKER_06]: No,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, people are getting DP, not you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he wants it, Derek step right up in the
plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's welcome here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take the mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was referencing Adam open his mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: My listeners have been assaulted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fuck reptiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think Rastaseb still listening?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is definitely going to be like a
Thursday bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not going up main week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be a main Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, people might, might send me some funky
ass emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I'd love to hear your emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: My show, uh, either, either show that you,
if you're hearing me on the, on my,
[SPEAKER_06]: on my feed, email me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's go from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening to me on the Colorado
podcast, do it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Email me grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you guys are thinking of this fucking
chaotic random show here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to know what you want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it could always a whole nother new
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's definitely another podcast
here in the works.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wish we all had fucking seven hours
to record tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a decent name for that,
but I mean for your podcast too,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well, I thought of one the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody in this group right now is on
that, that I can own your domain name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go telling everybody that on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's out there buying park domain names
all day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a new one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've already been on that hype
for a few years, but Jesse just found that
[SPEAKER_05]: hype and he's like, dude, I can,
I can fuck with my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wouldn't really call these people
friends, but your friends close and the
[SPEAKER_05]: other ones closer on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate follow them on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make troll accounts and follow their
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even want to hear that from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put your phone down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on how committed you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're way too committed to the whole
trolling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on Snapchat, rub one out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't like do it with your own real
account, it's not really worth the effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, it's been an hour and 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: My listeners have shot themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're going to edit this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting it up just like it is,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty high.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way it's going to go on ours in
one episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to cut it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get it on the website.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a special episode just for on the
website or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want me to edit it down to a solid
hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I could put it up on SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do it as two episodes in one
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just part one or two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not argue about this while we're
wasting precious time.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the end of this part of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening on my feed,
I'm going to come back and talk in a
[SPEAKER_06]: minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So listen to music on my feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll probably do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, uh, yeah, I think we just want to
record post-production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to tell everybody to say
goodbye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, thanks for coming to my house
and hanging out and doing a kickass
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize to my listeners for not
talking a lot about cannabis, but this was
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of fucking fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam, you're not as crazy as you think you
are.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you're quiet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should talk more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And dude, you're really good at
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pretty good at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd better be by now, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hit stop on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you later people.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
