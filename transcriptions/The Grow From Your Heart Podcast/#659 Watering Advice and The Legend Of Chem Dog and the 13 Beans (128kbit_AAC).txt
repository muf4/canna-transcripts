get the show to 10,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost to 8,000 at the time I'm
recording this probably seven point seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not look very recently but we're
pretty close to seven point seven
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the big push.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends did post to social
media saying hey let's get Rasta Jeff to

[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the support from
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the love from my friends trying to get
us up to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love.

[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe type in some comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know what you think about the show
if you're watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's do move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I had some grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to talk a little bit about
watering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with a couple of other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be teaching people how to water some
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to go into too many details
about that but as I was teaching people to
[SPEAKER_00]: water these plants basically what I did
was I went to their grow and I just stood
[SPEAKER_00]: around and watched them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of acted aloof a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked like I was on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked like I was distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an appearance that I gave on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got comfortable in their grow
environment and they did their day in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and I just kind of watched and they
didn't know I was watching in such detail
[SPEAKER_00]: but I took a few notes on the phone,
wrote down some ideas, thought of ways we
[SPEAKER_00]: can improve their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I really noticed that
these people were doing that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: improve upon I noticed right away is they
are watering the very center of their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what size container
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one gallon, two gallon,
three gallons, 50 gallons, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what size your container is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not ideal to water just the center
part of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when that plant is a baby,
when it's new, when it's just getting
[SPEAKER_00]: established and doesn't have a big root
system it's okay to water that inner
[SPEAKER_00]: circle there but once the plant grows then
we're going to water want to water the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer part of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are only going to grow where
there is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look for water but if
they don't find water they're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to die and that's where the roots end is
where the water doesn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do water these plants at the
outer edge a little bit more, the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get bigger roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger, healthier roots in some ways do
translate to bigger, healthier fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a good catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100% accurate because I can grow
you big ass plants in tiny pots in a hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: system but if you do have big,
fat, healthy roots your plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: more healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat better, they can cycle
better, you can get a longer wet and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: time so if you want to go away for the
weekend you can water them down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you want a bigger root system,
you want to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just watering right in the
middle because I was watching these people
[SPEAKER_00]: walk up to their pot, they'd get their
watering container and just pour it right
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle and I was like you maybe hit
like 30% of the root zone of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going right down the middle
of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not spreading out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is through gravity and the way
that it flows but it would have been more
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal to water the whole top part of that
plant and let it soak all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for the raspy voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise that didn't happen until I
pressed record today and then I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: raspiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fight right through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water the outer part of the plant,
not just the newer plant, as the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're brand new, absolutely you do
just have to water that inner part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got the appropriate pot size
for your plant and for its roots you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be watering most of that root zone,
most of that soil zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just water the center,
water the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, the plants are
shaped like an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it, the rain would
come down and the rain would hit the top
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and it would spread it out wider
and then it would go down and spread it
[SPEAKER_00]: out wider and go down and spread it out
wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the leaves are shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of taper outward in a tier
system just like we build a roof,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the way we put the shingles on the
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water has to flow a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are already doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably where we got the idea of
how to lay the shingles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rain will hit the water,
the water will drip outward and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at the ground where it rains,
there will be a big circle of water around
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right under the plant didn't even get
watered because unless water flowed into
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but it was protected from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get hit underneath, but all
around it is all wet and all that root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone and that big circle is getting wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it, the plants do
want water at that outer edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shaped like an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get water to that outer edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here are some things that will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will branch out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't think it's in a little tiny zone
and it will branch out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get more branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get more activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get more growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I noticed that these people had
their plants in too small of a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants weren't going to grow very
big and they probably were in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: size pot because they weren't watering
enough to get them to fill the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would recommend a larger pot than
what they were using because their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to get root bound, which is
another thing that was causing their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to get tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their plants were very tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we water more space to water,
more space for roots, those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the root base tucked into a
little tiny coffee can, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put into a bigger pot, they're
going to get wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have more root space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll feel more comfortable getting
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, their plants were too close
together, which wasn't too big of a deal
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a bunch of fish and pole plants
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too pressed together,
too tall and lanky, and in too small of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were starting to auto flower because
they were so upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the lower stuff wasn't getting
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't clean up any of the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was starting to auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pressed so close together,
the light wasn't getting down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having those plants pressed so closely
together and not cleaning up the bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of them was making them go into flower and
the roots haven't even filled these
[SPEAKER_00]: containers yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's way early to flower these plants
and it was way early for them to be so
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants were going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things we can start with is water
that outer edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing we can do is make sure
to have our plants far enough apart to
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can grow and get some branching
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing we should do is make
sure to up pot at the right time to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that early flowering because once
they do get root bound, they can go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower early on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got a lot of notes in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure I covered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered that section quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit all the bullet points I've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to a grow question that came
from my friend Brohand78 on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is patreon.com forward slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I was wondering something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently grew your Golden Goat Femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very lucky person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Golden Goat Feminine seeds are sold
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have and will be sold out for a short
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, you're a lucky person to
have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they came out beautifully by the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good work to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took you nine probably 12 weeks to get
that whole project completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did all the hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says I found one perfect looking
seed in a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no males around at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would this seed even be viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said this several times on several
shows before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming you nothing for not
hearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is my theory on how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are a lot like Jurassic Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature finds a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one goal for our plants,
we have a lot of ideas and a lot of goals
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to grow them and pop and twist
them and defoliate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to smoke them and we want them to
get us high and we want to turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates or baked goods or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has one main goal in its own
mind and that is to reproduce to make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for the next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your plant's whole goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a female plant, it wants to get
seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a male plant, it wants to do some
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the main goal of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will find a way to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not uncommon for these plants to
kind of just throw one or two random
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will call it a stress seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will call it a herm seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see any intersex flowers on
that plant, then it's nothing to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a plant will make a seed because
it is striving to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes this is because the plant went
a little bit longer than it should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got one fully developed
perfect looking seed, that seed happened
[SPEAKER_00]: early in the flowering process and that
bud just that plant just knew I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: good bud and we have to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life does find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Jurassic Park theory is what I
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I borrowed that from James
Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my buddy James Bean if
that is where I learned the Jurassic Park
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is happening here is basically
life will find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things that could cause
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been some intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have just been life finding a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another thing known as I'm going
to say it wrong because I didn't Google
[SPEAKER_00]: the word before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's rhodolization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what it is is growing the plant
longer than it needed to flower and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that will make the plant make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like you did that because
you probably didn't know the seed was in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably just harvested your normal
buds and you're grinding up a bowl one day
[SPEAKER_00]: and heard tink tink in the grinder and
went, oh, dude, I got a seed in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call that a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a freebie seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The follow up is there were no males
around at all yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the life will find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The will to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, would this seed even be
viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my friend, Brohand78.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good springboard for some
rambling here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seed, if it looks perfect,
the only way to find out if it is viable
[SPEAKER_00]: is to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it sprout?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then veg it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a clone of it because you may have
the next champion plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be something amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be better than the original
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could blow Golden Goat out of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this could be complete trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could just be something with nanners
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could just be a totally freaky mutant
plant that you want to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how a lot of famous strains were
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get a clone of this plant,
flower it out, see what it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't even need to smoke it with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe halfway through growing it,
you're going to say, look, it's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a trichome tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll know three weeks into flower
that it's a winner or a loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: But grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you technically have would be labeled
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't call it Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say it's Golden Goat bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it came from a bag of Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a seed that we don't know why
that seed happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it came from Golden Goat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the female was Golden Goat,
but we don't know why that seed happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't label it with a full on name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an A grade seed because we
don't know the full pedigree of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few strains that I feel
happened this way or in a similar manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the original Golden Goat actually
was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not supposed to be bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy had a male plant and he had a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not breed the original Golden Goat,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was made by Mr. Dank in Topeka,
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Dank's male plant got away from
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pollinated his female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found some seeds in there when he was
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I don't know if he was smoking or what,
but he found the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was technically bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same scenario which you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidental seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became Golden Goat, which is world
renowned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a famous fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seed I make sells out immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very famous strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was made by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Glue was made by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one of the world's most
famous strains that sought after all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds of Gorilla Glue get sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: People claim to have Gorilla Glue crosses
that they don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the Golden Goat until we made it
into Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is another accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot prove, but I don't think Girl
Scout cookies was really made with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything on purpose or we would know what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody would come forward and say,
it was this crossed to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it in this basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it's shrouded with mystery,
which makes me think it was an accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: bag seed that somebody found and they grew
and they found a gem just like you
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something else we should
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the Chem Dog line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that came from Chem Dog
genetics started with bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk a little bit about Chem Dog
and the Legend of the 13 Beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided right now that I would
update you on the Chem Dog story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't known as Chem Dog yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to some Grateful Dead shows and he
met up with some guys named AJ and Peabud.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ and Peabud were growing some weed that
they called Dog Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it Dog Bud because when you
smoked on it and you smoked it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you rolled over on your back like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it the Dog Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of their friends were calling it the
Chem Weed because it smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were asking what kind of chemicals
they grew it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best of my recollection of
this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Peabud and Joe were growing,
were getting, I don't know if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it or getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting the Dog Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it Dog Bud because it
would make you stone like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd lay on your, roll over on your back
like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they were calling it the Chem Weed
because their friend said it smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of spawns the name Chem Dog
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not putting a W in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Chem Dog with an O.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of us that are using the W,
we're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old school Chem Dog with an O,
not with a W.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys run into a guy whose name
will be left out of the story at a
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead concert at Deer Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he buys some weed from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He realizes this weed's fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exchange numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead tour ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peabud and Joe go back to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly Breckenridge is where I think
this, where they were from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who later becomes Chem Dog goes
back to his place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contacts them later, says I want some
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They teleported them some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they fucking mailed it to them
allegedly probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly how that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boys in Colorado allegedly got the
man who later became Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got him some product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was allegedly, I've heard two
different stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard there were three ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard there were four ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to chime in somewhere and
let me know that, I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get this story right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just now decided to tell you so I'm
trying to remember the best I can from
[SPEAKER_00]: memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys get herb to the man who
becomes Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Dog finds 13 seeds in this bag of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all three ounces or four ounces,
however many he got, there were 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sprouted some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard him talk on future podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can't hear him talk on future
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after this story, I heard him talk on
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what I meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew what I meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard him talk on podcasts where he
said, I wish I knew what I was doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: those mails because now I kick myself for
culling those mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mails were probably fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Chem Dog mails got tossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were all the females that he found
he kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he may have more seeds,
according to the legend of Chem Dog and
[SPEAKER_00]: the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those 13 beans, we got the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess he popped that in 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the Chem D, which happened to have
a lot of, I'm not exactly sure why it got
[SPEAKER_00]: called Chem D, but it had a lot of that
tennis ball chemical sort of a smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem 91 was skunkier in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite is the skunky one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem D is kind of gassier in tennis
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the Chem Sister and there are
other Chems that came from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have done research, but the top
three that you'll know are the Chem 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Chem D, and the Chem Sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there was one that was
just straight called Chem Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is Chem Dog is the guy who found
those seeds in a bag of weed and he grew
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're calling the weed Chem Dog and
there is a guy known as Chem Dog from some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that came from bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you've got is bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the next Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be the guy of legend of the
Golden Goat S1 and the one bean that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be you right now, or you could have trash
that you should throw away at week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is my recollection of randomly
deciding to tell you the legend of Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog and the 13 Beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two guys in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it the dog weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They met a guy at a Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, they got him some of the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 13 seeds netted us some of the most
prolific, influential cannabis in our
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog, in our gene pool, in our fucking
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows what Chem Dog is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows about Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody smoked Chem, Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I had a friend say, dude,
have you shopped at this dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, I don't really shop
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, they have a shelf that it's
all seeded, but the weed is super good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's got a few seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, how many seeds are in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you get like one or two seeds
an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, how much is an ounce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, I go, bro, just go buy an
ounce and hope you get 10 seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like buying a fucking pack of
killer seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow that, you're going to find
fire in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, really, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, those are free seeds,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are going to be mad,
but go buy an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hope you get a 12 pack of free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price of an ounce is what a 10 or 12
pack of seeds would cost you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically he's getting an ounce
of shitty weed to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told him, go get an ounce of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how long I've been going,
but let's do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of editing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been learning a couple of tricks of
Final Cut Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, thank you for all the
compliments, the feedback, all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff on the last couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working hard on making creative
intros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working hard on just doing some
details to make the show better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be a top notch podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the content coming from this
section, the notes, the show, that part is
[SPEAKER_00]: good in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my show, but I feel like the next
step is production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the compliments,
the words of encouragement, the words of
[SPEAKER_00]: wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have sent me some feedback and
stuff and some advice also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for growing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being patient while I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be probably kind of a
short episode because I do need to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to figure some stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also working on color correcting is the
next move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am never the right color in these
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to figure that shit out one of
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color correction is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super stoned before this episode.

down a little bit.
