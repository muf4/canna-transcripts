[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode 696 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to focus on
another breeding question before I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few shout outs to a few of
those great folks who continue to support

show in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: A link in the show notes and in the video
description to make it nice and easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's not waste too much time
here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into some of the emails
that our friends have sent us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Maritime
Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is so far I'm very
impressed with the Golden Goat BX I have
[SPEAKER_00]: received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is working out great,
but I need to look at expanding my
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is very a grower thing once you
get good at growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize I want to grow something
different, grow more, get more
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences, more flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you end up filling a room with a
bunch of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get so passionate about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get enough plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't grow enough plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to grow, smoke, try it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm a big fan of Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's probably my favorite strain to
date and I've been stoned for over 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years on all different types of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us that have been smoking for a
long time love the Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Chem, the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three distinct flavors and
aromas and kind of classes of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Sour Diesel, that Diesel Terp,
the buzz, the flavor, the aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything about it is highly desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got a bag of the good Sour Diesel
in your pocket, you get in the car with a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and they're like oh dude you
brought the Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole neighborhood knows right away
when you roll a joint and smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Sour Diesel is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why it's one of your
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's got its own category.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gas, that Diesel flavor, that's its
own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what strain would you say would be
close to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing different strains for
six years looking for something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: and since after after 650 plus podcasts,
I feel that you, your genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge can help with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up and growers love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course that was from our friend
Maritime Grower there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I read the message about the Sour
Diesel, I could smell the Diesel the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it used to make my, it would make my
my smoke room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was my bedroom back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make that room stink so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remembered how when I would get a large
quantity of it, maybe allegedly I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend that was growing a lot of it and I
would get a large quantity and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: make the whole house smell funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you would drive with it in the car
you'd be, I would be so paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a gassy skunk, dirty Diesel
fuel sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of burns my eyes in a delightful
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz gives me tunnel vision to where
all I can focus on is what's right in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me and I can't even barely pay
attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love good Sour Diesel stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question here is what strain would
you say would be close to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to make a lot of
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's nothing like real,
true real deal Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't make a recommendation for
anything from my line currently that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say would be real deal, true Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mislead you, lie to you,
give you the wrong information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may allegedly have crossed something
with a Diesel plant, but it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't had time to be ran at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't testing, but being a good
friend, somebody that wants to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you get what you're looking for,
our friend JJ from Top Dog has been
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out Sour Diesel BX3 and I've got a
pack of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do intend to maybe select a mail out of
those in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have room to run them right now,
but if you are looking for high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel seeds right now, to the best
of my knowledge, there may be more out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing any other breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving love to the breeder that I know
does have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ Top Dog Genetics does have the real
deal Sour Diesel BX3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure if you are looking for JJ,
if you're looking for Top Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the appropriate page on Instagram
if you are following them on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna sidetrack here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On social media right now, there are a lot
of fake accounts posing as your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: seed makers, seed breeders, seed vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice if you pay close
attention, their account is just one
[SPEAKER_00]: letter off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking about Top Dog right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top Dog is top, T-O-P-D-A-W-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may put two W's in the Top Dog and
you may not even notice that or they may
[SPEAKER_00]: throw an underscore in a weird place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read underscore genetics is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read dot genetics is not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people on Instagram right now are
really trying to scam people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a breeder posts a photo and then
somebody says, hey, where can I find this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a scammer that follows up right
away and says, hey, I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those most likely are not the
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders don't do a lot of sales
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for everybody, but most of
the breeders do their sales through the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a recommended or it is a
suggested vendor list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people have been tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they've been vetted as the word my
brain is searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know those are good vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they will not rip you off,
burn you, scam you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the seeds that they send you came
from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're checking out the real
social media pages and that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: following the real social media and that
you are getting seeds from reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to figure out where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel from JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the Sour Diesel,
I highly recommend JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would trust and believe that that's the
real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a pack of those seeds before warned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not the cheapest seeds on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking trash about AJ's prices
are JJ's prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think in diesel, I think AJ that's
a whole nother.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody knows why you understand why AJ
Sour Diesel is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But JJ will charge you a little bit for
those seeds, but if you find that Sour
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel that you're looking for,
it is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do pay for a premium product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm warning you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect to the people charging a top
dollar for their product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charge what you want, but to you customers
that are going to go look right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Sour Diesel, I would recommend that
you get the Sour Diesel BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a BX three, a bat cross
number three from our friend top dog
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, top dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, make sure you guys are
supporting the correct social media page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we did have a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any names,
but a friend was scammed out of a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody on social media was claiming to
be I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that was a fake account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw them on a live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Hey, did you send my package?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I didn't send any package
politely went and we did some messaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and they sent me screenshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was pretending to be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're purchasing seeds out there,
you guys check the email address,
[SPEAKER_00]: check the social media account,
double check your, uh, your dots,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dashes, underscores, make sure you're
messing with the right person.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my friend maritime grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more advice for you,
but I don't have something in my line that
[SPEAKER_00]: is reliably a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you that nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to mislead you lie to you,
but I do know that it's available via top
[SPEAKER_00]: dog genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to seeing pictures of
your grow of the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do obtain those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obtain a acquire score when you get them,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more message here before we
get to the breeding part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from the man with no
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, I love the podcast and the
plants you put out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is I have an AC
infinity fan, a six inch AC infinity fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a three by three tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the AC infinity and my four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I'm having problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Nanner's really bad since I got the
AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, you're ending up with
intersex plants ever since you got that AC
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say if the fan outtake is
sucking in the sides of the tent cannon,
[SPEAKER_00]: will that cause Nanner's and by Nanner's
he means intersex plants hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've have the speed control on the lowest
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it talks about some other strains
he's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about this just briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sides of the tent being sucked in are
not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your carbon filter inside
the tent, then you're sucking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, that should, will not cause
intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got quality genetics,
that should not be the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking since you've introduced this
new fan, there is some sort of a light
[SPEAKER_00]: leak would be my first assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else got adjusted during
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the AC infinity
controller is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that I would
investigate, but my very first assumption
[SPEAKER_00]: would be that you have now got a light
leak that you have not yet discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would see where that AC infinity
controller is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that inside the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in the tent, it is coming on
during your night night cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is giving you your intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the new the new blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing my face off this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that new blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the ducting ran now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the ducting going a different
direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're getting light through the
ducting or did you open a flap that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: open before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I just thought of this while I'm
talking my way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent is sucking in on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tents usually have flaps on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they opening up so much that you're
allowing light in through the bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unlikely, probably not the
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my main, if you're getting intersex
plants now that you weren't getting before
[SPEAKER_00]: this piece of equipment, I'm going to
assume it's a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be my very first
assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like to see the walls of the
tent suck in a little bit when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets me know, first of all,
it lets me know I'm getting enough suction
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pushing out more air than I'm able to
pull in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's struggling to get air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just caving in because so much air
is going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that all of the air going out
is getting carbon filtered and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing that air just fucking as quickly
as possible as it can be replaced in that
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep making this motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's air coming in through the bottom,
going up, going through the carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: going out of the ducting, going out of
that tent, and then wherever you've got it
[SPEAKER_00]: directed, if it's out of the house,
out of into the attic, out of a window or
[SPEAKER_00]: just back into the room, which could work
if you do that properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recondition that air and then blow
it back into the tent, that would work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat rises, lower air is at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could figure out how to make that
happen for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I really don't think that
that suction is ever going to cause you
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that sort of a thing in
tents for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any tents running right now,
which is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've usually got tents, a tent going
somewhere and I always have it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where when you unzip it, you kind of
hear the tent go, Oh, I was getting sucked
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative pressure is what that is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a problem that shouldn't be
causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really think it is your,
if you've ran these plants before and you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't ran into intersex issues,
I'm going to assume there is a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there, go in the tent during your
night cycle when the lights should be off,
[SPEAKER_00]: go in the tent if you can, if you can fit
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard as shit for me to go in the
tent, but go in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can look around during the light
cycle and see what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an extension cord that's got a
light on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a piece of equipment that lights
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a, do you have a hygrometer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a thermostat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any sort of equipment that is
in there that's got any kind of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your dehumidifier have a light on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything in there that is
producing any kind of light during the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I really do believe it is a light
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can fit in there, if you can
stand in that tent in that space,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're I wouldn't fit, if you can fit
in there, go in there and turn off the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in the grow space and leave the
outside lights however they would be in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room and see if you're getting any
light in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand in there for three to five minutes,
cover your eyes, let them adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open them up, do you see any any
any light at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face during the dark cycle, that is too
[SPEAKER_00]: much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes those tents are not
completely light proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'll get just a black sheet
and put it over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to run a strip of duct
tape right down the edge of the where the
[SPEAKER_00]: zippers are just to cover up some light
leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times near the corners where the
seams are kind of pulling like where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of stress of one seam going
this way and one going that way at a
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, you'll get some stretchiness of
the the material and you'll get like light
[SPEAKER_00]: leaks down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it looked,
but you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check for leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my main assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've spent enough time saying
light leaks on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to my friend, the man with no name,
big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we have solved your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not a light leak, send me another
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's jump into the part of
the podcast that everybody has been
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for the part that I teased at the
top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a breeding question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a friend who is breeding with
the Australian bastard cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too far into this,
let's talk about the Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just briefly, you may have seen pictures
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have read about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen our friend Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC highly gongenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: She changed her social media name and it
threw me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: She grew the Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's playing with the bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very interesting looking cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not produce normal looking
cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are kind of kind of ferny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like something you'd find out in
a rainforest or if you're walking along
[SPEAKER_00]: out in Oregon or something, it looks like
a very organy mossy area kind of a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, excuse me for the throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just blame that on the dabs all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a good weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it looks more like a plant that
you would find in a mossy area or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it looks like something
that grandma might have in the mix of
[SPEAKER_00]: houseplants or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really look like a
traditional cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that I've seen grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does produce buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't produce an amazing amount of
trichomes or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does produce a very unique looking
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a preface, if you will,
for this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into the email part of this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope all is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try breeding out for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very interesting
experiment for your first time breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I would recommend this
for your first time, although I am the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of person that wants you to have fun
and do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend to more regular cannabis
plants, things that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: just we'll talk about why in the future,
just because you're going to have to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: this multiple generations to see the
results that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're looking for,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be discouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see some results on the
first run, I would work with regular
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but I'm kind of do your thing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun and do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live your dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live your best life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only live once all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, don't let me discourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I do want to use Humboldt Seed
Company's Freak Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a fern if you
haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I know exactly what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of people out there
putting different versions of the Freak
[SPEAKER_00]: Show out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm not really sure what else I'm
going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my question is, how do I get the
offspring to look like the Freak Show?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I would draw a Punnett
Square, and we'll talk about Punnett
[SPEAKER_00]: Squares in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to teach a full Punnett
Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be able to tell, I would be
able to predict a lot of what the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to look like and a lot of what
the genetics are going to do based on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Punnett Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I teach about breeding,
I say learn about Mendel charts and
[SPEAKER_00]: Punnett Squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about the way that the plants work
together when you breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just learn about the scientific part of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I follow that up by saying,
when you're breeding, forget all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and use your intuition because I find that
to be super important as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I'd like to say that I'm a
successful breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made some crosses that are out there
that are paying some bills and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: really happy with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll call that a success, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just see some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, have you ever known two people
and you're like, hey, you and hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, if you guys met, it's going to be
fucking a match made in heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you introduce two people, like five
years later, they're married and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: a family and you're like, yeah,
I'm kind of happy that I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I feel like I've got that ability
with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the Mendel charts,
the alial charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I can intuitively see the things
that are going to kind of happen with
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with the Australian bastard,
however, brings a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with that plant at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot about its heritage,
its history, where it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: which helps me a lot as a breeder,
as a grower to kind of predict a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you a lot of things about a plant
when you know its genetics, its parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from on the planet,
what a lot of it tell it lets you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about what to expect from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the bastard, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote, we would have to find out if
that funky leaf trait, that ferny leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a technical word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten, what's the word that I
found?
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned this word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find the word in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop up when I read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose my place though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a word for that funky leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to find out, we have to determine
if that is a recessive or a dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way to find that out basically is
by growing out a batch of it and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have to decide, do you want to
use a male or a female of the Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: bastard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from some, I talked to a friend who
was grown and bred with the Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm leading up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to wonder if you want to use
the male or the female, then it turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to have to do some
f-tooling before you even get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: standard plant to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I did want to talk about before
we get too far, and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage you from the Australian bastard
cannabis, but I've never seen anybody post
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of finished, and I'm not talking
trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my experience on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever posted a finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been like, look at this amazing
Australian bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people post like week
five, six, and seven photos, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, look at this crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pictures kind of taper off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like too many people are
blown away, ecstatic, super satisfied,
[SPEAKER_00]: braggadocious about the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really trying to talk shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that's what I've
experienced on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody seems to, the pictures are great,
but nobody's like, man, when I smoke this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really seen anybody ecstatic and
in love with the bastard cannabis in that
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool for photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be cool for breeding, but I haven't
seen anybody blown away by any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some Australian bastard
cannabis out there that blew your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to friendly corrections and
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just going to tell me I'm a dick
because I just said that, have some photos
[SPEAKER_00]: and something to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be friendly with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find my place in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're going to have to get
yourself some Australian bastard cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds is probably how you're going to have
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have to grow them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a plant with the traits you were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully find a male and a female with
the traits you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're going to have to breed
those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can at the same time while you're
doing this, you can pollinate other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but those aren't going to have the
bastard trait as strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: From some of the advice I was given,
you're going to have to make F2s before
[SPEAKER_00]: you can even bring out that trait to get
it to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me jump into this message that our
friend, I was talking with our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Locomotive Medical has been doing some
breeding with the Freak Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just reached out to a member of the team
because I knew somebody was working with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what can you tell me about
breeding with the Freak Show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have a question and here's what my
friend Locomotive Medical had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the Freak Show or the Pinot Leaf
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinot, P-I-N-N-A-T-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinot Leaf trait is recessive or at best
an incomplete dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cross it with traditional palmit
plants, the palmit trait dominates the F1s
[SPEAKER_00]: and the F1s mostly look normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you cross it with anything one time,
that offspring is going to look mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: like a normal cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some outliers that do pop up
with the bastard trait, but overall it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like most of them are going to look
mostly normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says the F2s have some strange
plants and 25% freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you're going to start
finding plants that you can narrow down
[SPEAKER_00]: and isolate the leaf structure you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're also going to have to think
about the terps, the potency, the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaf structure is just one thing on a
big chessboard of traits that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for for a successful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaf trait is cool, but you want it
to smoke good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to smell good, taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get high as fuck from it,
or it's got to have a lot of CBD or a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, something really high in a
specific cannabinoid or a certain terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to blow your mind in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to produce seven pounds of light
or something like that to make it stand
[SPEAKER_00]: out, make it a good plant overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be pathogen resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to handle nutrients well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be growable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one trait is the leaf that
we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the F2s will have some strange plants
and 25% freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point I would find another,
a male and a female that both look like
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the leaf trait you're looking
for, that pennant leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would breed those together and make
F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says F3, you can stabilize for that
trait by F3, similar to auto flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period outcross projects work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by F3, you can lock it down,
but the first cross is going to look just
[SPEAKER_00]: like normal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a couple of weirdos in there,
but then you got to cross it again to
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting more of that freak trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see it until the
second and then the third one you can lock
[SPEAKER_00]: it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend says that's about all the
tips I have for the Australian bastard
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my buddy, Locomotive
Medical for having great info on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump more back into your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the traits to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to make it look like the
freak show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to take the freak to
another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you do that, you're only
going to get about 25% freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a freak that you like, the one that
works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male and a female, do that again,
then find another male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work best for you and do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to the F3,
the seeds that come out after that should
[SPEAKER_00]: be quite a bit freak show uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can find the phenotype that works
the best for you out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can self that you can start back
crossing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got that gem that is exactly
what you're looking for, which is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: around the F3 range, then you can start
doing a lot of fun things with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I did not discourage you by
giving you such a long path to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the kind of person that
enjoys a really long project like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to chuck some pollen,
make some seeds and see what they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fun diversity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you trust and know your parent plants,
you can make some great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can predict what you're going to
make with an F1, if you can kind of write
[SPEAKER_00]: down, I think like my goal is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it comes out like that,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make F1s that are predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good product in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are not into the F1s,
but anyway, I'm kind of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're excited about having a long
project, I encourage you to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my first breeding project,
I don't know that I would work with this
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may work with something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your goal is to fix the Australian
bastard, because I did say that I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen one that impresses me when it's
finished, I'm really not trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying we see a lot of people
post their grows and then we see it all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to the end and then we get to
see them like harvest it in the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They post a picture of them holding the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see a lot of that with the
Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all quit posting their pictures
around, I don't know, right after the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: start forming and kind of where they
should get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just fizzle out with the
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not being hateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying that's what I've seen mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can be the person that breeds
something to it to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can still get that Australian
bastard cannabis leaf structure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, the vigor, the potency of some of
the other hype strains, popular strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: productive strains that are on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that is your goal, I do wish you
the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can give you any other guidance,
because I do not mean to ever discourage
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody, I would just rather set you up
for success on your first run than watch
[SPEAKER_00]: you stumble and be frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can give you any other guidance,
any other advice, please do reach out.
