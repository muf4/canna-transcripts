[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking big dabs of Double OG
Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Legend OG and Sour
Double.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
pine, sour, and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will completely agree with that flavor
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like somebody cleaned a skunk's
ass with Lemon Pledge here in my recording
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says this
product contains 62.03% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the buzz of the Double OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious Full Spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract.

[SPEAKER_00]: stabby mix stab wood big thanks and big
shout out to everybody who supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: show and has continued to support the show
on patreon I could not do it without your
[SPEAKER_00]: support the computer that I am using to
record this show was actually funded by
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon contributions that was covered
just a couple of years ago recently I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that my macbook is acting a little
bit funny and it is also warped on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom I don't know how that happened I
don't know what does that but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to bubble so it is almost time to
replace this macbook that will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful that will not be a problem there
will be no issue because my friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon have helped out so well that I'll
just be able to go to the computer place
[SPEAKER_00]: and say I need a new computer and it will
be covered through my friends on patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: so big thanks and big shout out for all of
the continued patreon support if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: not supporting the show on patreon and you
would like to learn how to do so all you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do is visit www.patreon.com
forward slash grow from your heart all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the information you need will be right
there on the screen I do not think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the patreon home page and actually
search for the podcast in the search bar I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you actually have to type in patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't allow us to come up in their
search bar because we are cannabis content
[SPEAKER_00]: providers but they haven't banned us from
the service so I don't complain you just
[SPEAKER_00]: have to type in the full URL or I have
made it easy for you I have included a
[SPEAKER_00]: link in the show notes so if you're
listening on apple podcast or on stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: radio or on google play or whatever
podcast service you're listening to click
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show scroll down find the show
notes and there will be a link to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon campaign in the notes I have also
included the link in the video description
[SPEAKER_00]: on youtube so once again big thank you big
shout out to everybody who supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on patreon I am trying to make it
easy for everybody to support the show
[SPEAKER_00]: because I do get at least one email every
week saying hey I'm looking for the show
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot find it on patreon what do I do it
is real easy simply follow the link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: show notes or the video description all
right the next order of business I have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten written down is to apologize for my
stuffy nose I sound like I've got a stuffy
[SPEAKER_00]: nose I sound like gonna sound like I'm
talking a little bit like this it is worth
[SPEAKER_00]: it it is all for good cause this evening I
walked into the flower room where I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a mail plant who is just dumping pollen
and I gave him a nice little tap a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little flick and I let all that pollen go
flying around all over a bunch of lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies so there has been a successful
phase one pollination that happened today
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do another pollination in three to
five days depending on how the male and
[SPEAKER_00]: the female plants look then once all that
pollen is shaken out I'll collect a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of it I may store some of it properly
we'll talk about pollen storage in another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode that's not what we're here for
today but I may store some of that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: then cut down that male then we will
change the light schedule and in
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 50 to 70 days we will have
more fresh seeds some of the items that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been sold out will be replenished and
there may be some new things that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be tested and tried out before they can go
to market but if I do sound a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy in my voice today if I sound like
I'm on the verge of sneezing that is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely accurate it is because I played
with a male plant and spread a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen throughout a room and it is messing
me up a little bit today I can taste it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can certainly feel it in my face so
I apologize if you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you're listening to me now but I
will be sending out the first batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to the vendors by March 1st so by
March 1st the TMNT line will be
[SPEAKER_00]: replenished but do not miss it because
they will go very quickly make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: signed up to all of the seeds here now
text alerts and all of their social media
[SPEAKER_00]: and also that you're on all of my social
media so you don't miss the TMNT seed drop
[SPEAKER_00]: and just a quick heads up the best place
to follow my social media for info on seed
[SPEAKER_00]: drops is on Instagram follow Iri
underscore genetics also make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the real seeds here now on
Instagram I also suggest you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: seedsherenow.com and sign up for their
text message blasts you will get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great updates and deals through that
service all right that's enough garden
[SPEAKER_00]: updates I told you that seeds will be
available soon I told you that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated another round we are making
great success in the breeding programs in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 thank you for following along the
next thing I should talk about is I
[SPEAKER_00]: recently did an episode about my nutrient
mix I did a very introductory episode that
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about how and why I do many of the
things I do then I discussed my vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix then I followed that
masterpiece up with another episode which
[SPEAKER_00]: included my flowering nutrient mix it was
very detailed it was very in-depth and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I covered most of the necessary
details I did get quite a few messages
[SPEAKER_00]: emails and comments and questions after I
posted those episodes one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common questions was why don't you list
your PPMs and your pH in each week now I
[SPEAKER_00]: do mention the pH quite often and I say
that through flower I generally recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: we keep our pH between 6.2 and 6.4 that is
a great range for our plants you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust to each specific plant possibly
each specific phenotype but I do believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that 6.2 to 6.4 will work for most plants
in most gardens if you've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you can find that most of them will
be happy within that range so I did
[SPEAKER_00]: mention that a couple of times I didn't
feel like I needed to say that on every
[SPEAKER_00]: week's mix details so if you go back and
listen you will hear that I say a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times 6.2 to 6.4 is the recommended pH if
you are running cocoa or soilless mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: you are running the nutrient mix which I
suggested and again that mix that I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is only going to work in cocoa
don't do that every day in a soilless mix
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll burn your plants you can do that
just break it down you'll need waterings
[SPEAKER_00]: without all that nutrients in between now
I'm rambling let's stay focused the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing people wanted to know is why don't I
mention the EC or the PPMs of my specific
[SPEAKER_00]: mix each week if you listen to both
episodes you'll remember that I said I do
[SPEAKER_00]: not use reverse osmosis water I don't find
it necessary where I am because we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: good water you may need it where you are
you may not that is up to you I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to waste that much water if it's not
necessary water is expensive water is
[SPEAKER_00]: limited we don't have unlimited water one
day we will run out of water I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see that world but it will happen one
day I don't want to fuck up and waste too
[SPEAKER_00]: much water so I don't use the RO
unnecessarily which means that my starting
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs and my starting EC are quite possibly
very different than your starting numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what is in your municipal
water I don't know what's in your well
[SPEAKER_00]: water I don't know what is in your tap
water I don't know what is in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: water you were using we have different
water sources so if we are 250 PPMs off
[SPEAKER_00]: when we start our math is not going to add
up now I could have done a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation I could have filled up a
container of water and I could have
[SPEAKER_00]: checked my PPMs there and see what I start
with and then I could have gone back and
[SPEAKER_00]: done the whole nutrient mix and measure
the PPMs and tell you what I ended with
[SPEAKER_00]: but if I only missed one detail in that
episode I am not mad at myself that that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the thing I skipped I feel like I did a
pretty good job on that episode so I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize that I did not include the EC or
the PPM of the nutrient solutions I have
[SPEAKER_00]: been mixing these mixes for quite a while
in quite a few rooms and I've written down
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC and the mix quite a few times and I
do remember off the top of my head that we
[SPEAKER_00]: generally stay within the 1.7 to 1.9 EC
range sometimes very rarely we will get up
[SPEAKER_00]: near the 2.1 EC range and that also is
going to vary based on which method you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to use are you using the Monday Big
Mix are you mixing everything all at once
[SPEAKER_00]: are you adding boosts that is going to
make a difference everything you add in
[SPEAKER_00]: will absolutely change your EC and your
PPMs so that is my update that is my
[SPEAKER_00]: disclaimer and that is my apology for not
including the EC or the PPMs in my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix episode alright podcast world
let's segue into the email portion of this
[SPEAKER_00]: show if you've got a cannabis culture or a
cannabis cultivation question and you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to ask me I would love to hear
from you my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com the first
email on today's episode comes from my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Giant Mike from Cannabuzz and it
goes a lot like this Yo Rasta Jeff I wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: to you last year around 420 to talk about
what 420 means to me and it was about my
[SPEAKER_00]: mother then I recently met you at the Endo
Expo and I want to compliment you again on
[SPEAKER_00]: your professionalism at the Endo Expo I
remember exactly who you are and the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment I read this email I remembered this
situation and it meant a lot to me it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a great moment I'm glad somebody else saw
it let's keep reading it says you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: don't remember me because I'm sure it
happened more than once but I was directly
[SPEAKER_00]: behind what appeared to be and then he
describes a couple of friends of mine we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to go into a full description I
don't know if they want to be described on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast he was standing directly
behind friends of mine he gives a good
[SPEAKER_00]: description it says yes I remember that
exact moment those are good friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine they are very huge supporters of
iregenetics I'm pretty sure they listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast and they make sure to come
say hi to me at every single cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry event in Colorado if there is an
event and I'm there I can rely on my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends to come give me a high five and a
hug I know exactly who you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about great folks a little tiny short
couple good friends of mine super sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: people I love that they are a couple that
they both interact with me a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to a cannabis event or a
cannabis industry sort of thing it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of dudes and a bunch of bros talking
to each other and the girlfriends look
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're getting drugged along by
their boyfriends I always make sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: politely and in a friendly way say hi to
the girlfriends to make sure they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: included in the event as well this couple
always shows up as equals they've both got
[SPEAKER_00]: a big smile on their face they're both
equally as excited to be at the event
[SPEAKER_00]: they're both equally excited to see me so
I love it when a couple comes to the booth
[SPEAKER_00]: like that let's get my stoned ass back on
track it says I've been a car salesman for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years from time to time people will get
excited about their car and want to hug
[SPEAKER_00]: their salesman or saleswoman and even try
to kiss us I know that awkward feeling and
[SPEAKER_00]: I get how to handle them by sidestepping
them and changing the flow of conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: to move on and make them forget about it
but you surprised me Rasta Jeff you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually came out of your booth and walked
around and gave them a hug and took a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with them I think you are a class
act for that hey I'm really glad that you
[SPEAKER_00]: caught that moment I'm really glad I got
to take that photo with my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it's all about I was at the
Indo Expo with a booth I was there in a
[SPEAKER_00]: business mode but when I see my friends I
want to make sure to stop and give my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends a high five or a handshake or a
hug I really made sure to try to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with everybody that came to my booth that
weekend I stuck my hand out and said I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff what is your name I try to treat
everybody like they're one of my best
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and also like they are one of the
most important people on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are I like to treat people
how I expect to be treated that's with
[SPEAKER_00]: kindness that's with friendship that's
with respect all that stuff that we expect
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give that as well and I'm getting
it in return the world is giving that back
[SPEAKER_00]: to me so I do try to shake people's hands
and look them in the eye of course I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: long weekend and I was heavily medicated
so there's a little bit of that you miss a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of that personal connection
because of that but I do my best to be
[SPEAKER_00]: present and say hi to everybody because
they're not there just to purchase seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to meet me they want to shake my
hand they've learned a lot from me and it
[SPEAKER_00]: means a lot to them to return the energy
they want to give me a hug and thank me
[SPEAKER_00]: and it means a lot so I appreciate that
you noticed that on that somebody actually
[SPEAKER_00]: caught me coming out from behind my booth
and hugging my friends they're not my
[SPEAKER_00]: customers those are my friends that's my
community and thank you I'm glad you
[SPEAKER_00]: caught that but let's keep going with this
email because I'm getting all gushy here
[SPEAKER_00]: it says I don't know I guess it's the
little things like that we really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think about but people notice and
something so small can make people start
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking the irie genetics Kool-Aid hey I
don't have any Kool-Aid to spill man I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope that everybody just follows along
because I'm doing a good positive thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like we're a seed breeders and the
cannabis community we're kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: band there are different breeders that do
different things they have different
[SPEAKER_00]: styles and if you're into their music
you'll listen to them I try to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: some positive music a positive vibe a
positive brand I try to be reliable and
[SPEAKER_00]: honest and I think it's working just being
me is working the best that it can it has
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a while to get here but it is really
starting to show so let's continue with
[SPEAKER_00]: the message it says I have been drinking
the irie Kool-Aid for a few years now but
[SPEAKER_00]: other people noticed it too and many
people behind me were shocked that you
[SPEAKER_00]: came out from behind the booth man again
that's what I'm there for I'm not some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of I'm there's no ivory tower there's
no sort of invisible fence there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: like that come give me a hug come say hi
come shake my hand come give me a high
[SPEAKER_00]: five I'm a really friendly dude I like to
meet the people all of that thanks and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those hugs that's what recharges me I
do make a little bit of patreon funding
[SPEAKER_00]: from this podcast but that covers the
computer and a few costs those hugs those
[SPEAKER_00]: high fives those good jobs all of that
stuff that is what recharges my soul
[SPEAKER_00]: recharges my spirit that's what keeps me
able to just ramble into a microphone and
[SPEAKER_00]: share my passion with you so thank you for
that thank you for noticing there is so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more to this message this person also
says sorry I'm kind of rambling but my
[SPEAKER_00]: point is keep up the good work you
represent you and your company very well
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you I appreciate that it is great
that somebody at an event caught that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just me being myself so that is a huge
compliment now here's another part the
[SPEAKER_00]: last paragraph of this email reads just
like this it says I'm sure you were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting flooded with questions about that
mix episode my question is really short it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I noticed you did not mention mammoth
pee have you not gotten good results from
[SPEAKER_00]: mammoth pee I am on the fence with it only
because of the cost I start using it the
[SPEAKER_00]: week before I flip my plants I have been
long awaiting your mix episode to hear if
[SPEAKER_00]: you use it and your take on it I'm gonna
jump in right there and say I do love
[SPEAKER_00]: mammoth pee it is a great product if you
guys aren't familiar with mammoth pee give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a quick google check it out it is a
great product however we agreed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities that it is not
cost-effective I am not trying to bash
[SPEAKER_00]: mammoth pee I don't have anything negative
to say about mammoth pee except when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to convince an investor and an
owner that you need to spend that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: money on one bottle they do get sticker
shock and in a commercial environment we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to order a lot of mammoth pee so we
opted to not use the mammoth pee in the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environments and honestly the
plants look extremely happy so we have
[SPEAKER_00]: opted to not use it in the commercial
environment like you said mainly for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost another small reason why we don't use
mammoth pee is basically a logistics issue
[SPEAKER_00]: we buy most of our products from one
warehouse everything comes on one truck
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really easy just to go down the sheet
and order all of the things we need and
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately that warehouse does not
carry mammoth pee so with the product
[SPEAKER_00]: already being a little bit not
cost-effective and then it's not carried
[SPEAKER_00]: by my normal distributor I don't make an
extra order to add that product to my
[SPEAKER_00]: lineup so those are two solid reasons why
I'm not using mammoth pee in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow again let me reiterate I don't want
to bash mammoth pee there is nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with mammoth pee it is a wonderful product
I have seen explosive root growth when
[SPEAKER_00]: mammoth pee is added in the early phases
and I have seen giant fat tasty buds when
[SPEAKER_00]: mammoth pee is added in later phases I do
like to add mammoth pee in my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grows I absolutely like to use mammoth pee
in my breeding projects but those are my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows where I am in charge of all
the nutrients all the budgeting everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is up to me so in those situations I do
apply mammoth pee I am also funding a much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller personal garden I don't have to
buy several five gallon bottles of mammoth
[SPEAKER_00]: pee so in my personal grows I like the
mammoth pee in my breeding program I
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly add mammoth pee and I do notice
that my seeds look fatter fuller and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier when I use the mammoth pee in my
personal breeding projects so that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: first part of that question I basically
don't use mammoth pee in the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow because it is very expensive and it
is also not available from my main
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor so I'd have to pay another
hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a truck deliver me another palette of
another very expensive product so we just
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to skip that step and honestly the
plants look beautiful the plants are very
[SPEAKER_00]: happy so they're not missing anything they
don't even know they're not getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a little bit more to this
question it goes on it says honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else I know in Colorado uses
mammoth pee or recharge or both so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked to not hear either on the mix
episodes is plus life really that good
[SPEAKER_00]: then they sign it with thanks for your
time giant Mike from cannabis a giant Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great message let's talk
more about plus life and recharge
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows I'm a good friend and a
big fan of Scotty real Scotty real of
[SPEAKER_00]: course is real growers real growers is who
makes recharge big shout out to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty real and guru while I'm at it let's
give a big shout out to the dude and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire DGC crew gang gang Scotty real
is my buddy Scotty real makes recharge I
[SPEAKER_00]: should be using recharge in my commercial
environments unfortunately my distributor
[SPEAKER_00]: does not carry recharge at their big
warehouse so once again it's not available
[SPEAKER_00]: at my main distributor recharge is a great
product recharge is cost effective I will
[SPEAKER_00]: say that it is cost effective I like to
use recharge in my personal grows Scotty
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that I never run out of recharge
once again thank you Scotty for always
[SPEAKER_00]: taking good care of me I like recharge
once a week at 2.5 grams of recharge per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of water once a week I feed every
plant recharge it goes in whatever I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing in Monday every week recharge goes
in there for every plant recharge is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great product again it's not sold through
my major supplier that distributes for my
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environments so that is
honestly the main determining factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: why I do not use recharge in my commercial
grows and why it was not included in my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix episode I love Scotty real I
love recharge that shit is awesome I did
[SPEAKER_00]: not include it because it is not available
through my vendor and through my client
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor I recommend it in my personal
grow I use it all the time I recommend it
[SPEAKER_00]: for your personal grow or your commercial
grow as well big shout out to recharge
[SPEAKER_00]: great product there is absolutely no
reason to not use it there are a million
[SPEAKER_00]: and one reasons why you should use it now
the last part of this email is is plus
[SPEAKER_00]: life really that good yes I do believe
that plus life is a quality product that
[SPEAKER_00]: is cost effective and it is doing exactly
what I expect it to and it works as
[SPEAKER_00]: advertised so yes I do think that plus
life is that good of a product and since
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already using the veg bloom base I'm
using the booster which is shine I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar feed which is push I feel like
it works very well just to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: round out the recipe with the plus life so
that is a quick rundown of why I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: include mammoth pee or recharge in my
nutrient mix episodes there is nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with those products they are great
products that is just not what I am doing
[SPEAKER_00]: in my commercial environment at this time
I told you I was going to be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: honest with you and tell you what I use
and I honestly I'm not using those
[SPEAKER_00]: products in my commercial environment at
this time I am using recharge in my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow all the time and I like to
use mammoth pee in my flowering plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are seeded because my seeds do show
to be fatter they're rounder they're
[SPEAKER_00]: harder and they finish even sooner when I
use the mammoth pee so once again big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my friends at mammoth pee and
also giant shout out to my buddy Scotty
[SPEAKER_00]: real and real growers also let's send one
