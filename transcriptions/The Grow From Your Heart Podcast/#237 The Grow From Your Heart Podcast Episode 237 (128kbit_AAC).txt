[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 237 of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Koo, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, maybe you can hear
it in my voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a gigantic dab and it's got me
all raspied up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been dabbing some lemon skunk with
Capleton mixed into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just took a big dab of some
screaming tangerines batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I taste the tangerines and I can hear
the scream.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My head is spinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm nice and dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got my voice in my throat feeling a
little funky, but I'm sure that will
[SPEAKER_02]: correct itself as I go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys saw the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually happened at like 1147 in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even really start thinking about
it until about eight in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was like, dude, the eclipse,
the eclipse, the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I walked outside to take out some trash
around 11 and I was like, what the fuck's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like middle of the day,
basically, and it was dark outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was real overcast looking and the
clouds had like a blue and pink,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a tight eyed tint to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like an old Grateful Dead shirt
or something in the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went back outside around 1145 when
the whole eclipse thing was happening and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't look directly into the sun
because that's how you go blind and that
[SPEAKER_02]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I could see from, what I actually
did was I held my cell phone in selfie
[SPEAKER_02]: mode so that I could see myself in the
screen and I turned my back to the sun so
[SPEAKER_02]: that the sun was shining into my camera
screen and I could see a picture of it
[SPEAKER_02]: that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to snap a pretty cool couple of
pictures of myself and the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty fun, but it was really
neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it did to the sky was kind of neat,
but the way that it affected everybody was
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was in a really weird mood all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were just acting super strange and
I was blaming it on the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn that music down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm trying to yell over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I hope you got to see the eclipse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a once in a lifetime sort of
thing, unless you live for a really long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really give it enough respect
when I heard about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that I did take a moment to pay
attention to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I'll get to see another
eclipse like that in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when the next one will
happen, but it doesn't seem to happen very
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm pretty lucky because now I've
seen several, I think I've seen a lunar
[SPEAKER_02]: eclipse, a solar eclipse, and in my
lifetime, Haley's Comet has passed
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get to see a whole bunch of cool
astrological shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the last episode, you guys,
I was kind of bragging about getting to go
[SPEAKER_02]: see Greg Proops at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Wednesday at ComedyWorks, Greg Proops
did not go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Proops was in London last week and
here's the story that he told.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg Proops was in London and he was at a
hotel and a light bulb went out and a lamp
[SPEAKER_02]: went out and Mr. Proops attempted to
replace the light bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says that when he turned it,
the light bulb exploded and it cut his
[SPEAKER_02]: thumb to the bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posted a photo of himself on Instagram
with a really groovy pink cast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen the man look so
disheveled.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's usually a pretty sharp looking man.
[SPEAKER_02]: His hair is always perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: His glasses are always straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: His suit is always perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: His picture on Instagram, he looked like
he may have just woken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did not get to see Mr. Proops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They offered another comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: In place of Mr. Proops, but it was a
comedian that I've seen before and I would
[SPEAKER_02]: not drive to Denver to see him again on a
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to that comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 130 miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two hours each direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a two drink minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at least a tank of gas
and a couple of drinks and then dinner
[SPEAKER_02]: while you're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to pay that to see a
backup comedian when I had plans to see
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Proops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I chilled out Wednesday, did a few
other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't get to see Proops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, he's rescheduled the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He will be back in about a month,
maybe two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get to see him then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another brag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday night, I get to see Mr. Burt
Kreischer, the machine at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you guys know how that one goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to quit bragging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move into some iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't read iTunes comments in quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this comment here, yes,
this was left August 8th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is new and I do not think
I've read this on the show yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if I did, I'm going to read this one
twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are an iTunes listener,
I encourage you to go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scroll down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about halfway to the bottom of the
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see a picture of my lovely mug over
a red, yellow, and green flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the middle of that page, there will be
a section that says ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on the ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage you to type a little review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think of the podcast
and then click on the amount of stars that
[SPEAKER_02]: you think I deserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, everybody has kindly given me a
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Star review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we've got up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 63 ratings and all of them are
five stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's read the most recent review.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline is very informative and it's
by a person who calls themselves Ray
[SPEAKER_02]: Straub is their iTunes handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, let me start it with a different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put my inflection in a different
spot here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast and stuff you should know are
my two favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the throwback Thursday episodes for
those long road trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hard to take notes while driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I hope you're not taking notes of
the podcast while driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please press pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please have a passenger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't write while you're driving,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also excuse me for all the throat
clearing you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That giant dab I took a couple of minutes
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still working and it's choking me up
still, but we'll get past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says that my podcast and another
podcast called Stuff You Should Know are
[SPEAKER_02]: his two favorites or this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's a male or female.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say this podcast and Stuff You Should
Know are their favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool because Stuff You
Should Know is a really good podcast also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always see that one in the top 50 or
top 100 podcasts for different categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the same categories as myself
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool to know that you're listening
to both of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do my best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a busy man and I have not missed an
episode and it's been three something,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost four years now, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, thanks for the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do my best to keep it going as long
as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I have a voice, a microphone,
some sort of USB interface and a MacBook
[SPEAKER_02]: and some wifi, I'll do my best to get the
show going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Throwback Thursday episodes for
those long road trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that comment because it's good
to know people are listening to those long
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making those takes a few minutes because
it ties up my computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to drag an hour file into a bunch
of three hour files.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get that three hour project
on garage man going, it really makes
[SPEAKER_02]: everything go super slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be times when I just get the
span and I don't get to do anything else
[SPEAKER_02]: with my computer and I just got to sit
here and stare at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for listening to the Thursday
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you appreciate those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loading those things to iTunes takes
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't know what he's talking
about, ladies and gentlemen, every
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday, I put out blocks of old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened is I got to 200 and
something episodes and old episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: started dropping out of the iTunes feed
and out of the Stitcher feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes and Stitcher and my website only
hold one hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of crucial and very informative
content are in episodes probably between
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 and 100 are some of the most
educational and well put together podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of stuff pre-written and I was
able to go back and use old material that
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been working on for a long time and
use things like there are episodes like
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling scheduling a perpetual harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the best episodes I ever put
out in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could have been a million dollar book
had I decided to do it that way but I put
[SPEAKER_02]: it out there for free and I wanted
everybody to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it got washed away from the feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once there was 173 episodes or something
like that, that episode was gone and no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started putting together chunks of
old episodes like episodes one through
[SPEAKER_02]: five and six through 10 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started putting those back on Thursdays
so that you guys can listen to that old
[SPEAKER_02]: content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what's happened is I've gotten so far
into those old episodes that old episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: are being knocked out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one through three and six through
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all gone out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I've done is I've made a YouTube
page and now you can go watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one through 76 are now
available on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do promise to keep posting more
videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, my computer gets tied up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only do one thing at a time on the
MacBook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do a lot of things but when you're
doing something like a podcast or a video,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just sucks everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only do one thing at that point
kind of at the computer's mercy but I will
[SPEAKER_02]: get all the stuff going.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is the old episodes are up in the
feed in chunks and they're also up on
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this guy's talking about,
the throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ray Strabo and thank you for
the great iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to
reading your review on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move forward into the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the last episode, I did what I called a
glossary and I kind of corrected some
[SPEAKER_02]: terms that people have been using wrong
and I haven't heard back from the person
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was aiming one message at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're still friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything is cool but I've got a
couple more things to add to the Rasta
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff glossary of ganja growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that I hear people use
incorrectly all the time and it drives me
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking crazy and a lot of my friends
mentioned that it drives them fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy also is the word strand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not growing strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have strands of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strands are hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't say, hey, my favorite strand
of weed is OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would say, my favorite strain of
cannabis is OG Kush and that would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: completely correct statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's quit saying strand and
let's replace it with strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strain is more appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanna be technical, you can go with
the word cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivar would be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that moves me into another word
that is probably going to get me off on a
[SPEAKER_02]: rant but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another word that I hear people
mispronounce and misuse quite often is the
[SPEAKER_02]: word phenotype and it's P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E,
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear a lot of people mispronounce this
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say phenome or there's just so many
other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even think of the wrong ones but
we shorten it often.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say phenome and I hear people say
phenome and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just phenome and phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual definition is the set of
observable characteristics of an
[SPEAKER_02]: individual resulting from the interaction
of its genotype with the environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is why I said it may get me off on a
rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things I feel like I
should explain to be a good podcast host.
[SPEAKER_02]: The set of observable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could talk about a lot of different
things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be people, it could be animals or
we could be talking about plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll stick with plants and we'll stick
with cannabis plants to keep this
[SPEAKER_02]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The set of observable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be, is it purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it tall and stretchy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it short and stout?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it red?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen cannabis turn red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen cannabis turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are observable characteristics of an
individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: The individual in this case being our
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those observable characteristics are
results from the interaction with its
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you see plants turning
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because of its environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is resulting from the interaction
with its environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see foxtailing, that's often a
result of its interaction with the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I skipped the word genotype when I gave
you a quick definition to break down some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genotype is basically, you cannot
change the genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the mom and dad made these genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always going to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That genotype will have phenotypical
expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those phenotypical expressions will be
things like I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you take the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say I grow a plant from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut two clones of it and I give a clone
to you and I give a clone to whoever else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys take it to your grow and you grow
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see different phenotypical
expressions from different grow rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have different environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy may get more purple on the stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy may get more turps and more aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy may get airier buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: One may get real dense rock hard buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be based on how much light,
how much air, how much water, what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be based on so many factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it could be based on one little
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on what those things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked in an earlier show about
everything adding up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be any one thing that makes a
difference in your phenotypical
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk a little bit more about
phenotypes and maybe give a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to talk about jelly bean on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not breed jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly bean was bred by Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is put out by TGA Genetics,
which is ran by Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Green Avengers, you can pick up your
jelly bean seeds probably at a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: different vendors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, jelly bean is a great example because
jelly bean puts out basically three
[SPEAKER_02]: different phenotypes and there are two
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it's kind of an older strain and it
puts out three basic phenotypes and there
[SPEAKER_02]: are two that you're looking for,
it's kind of a known thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into Subcool and if you paid any
attention to Subcool and read forms,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is kind of a known thing that's
talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly bean has one phenotype that's kind
of not desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not the one you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two others that you'd rather
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one that smells like a bag of
oranges or maybe a glass of orange juice
[SPEAKER_02]: with a little bit of pineapple juice put
into it is what I think it smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the orange phenos, what it's known
as.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because it's the phenotype that
expresses a very orange aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever you take that plant, wherever you
grow it, it's gonna smell and taste like
[SPEAKER_02]: oranges because that's its phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had that one that didn't taste
like oranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one that is known as the
candy store phenotype and it smells like
[SPEAKER_02]: jelly beans and skittles and then I think
Easter candy that's real dry has like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sugary powdery sort of a smell to it like
a pixie stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell the powder and that may
sound weird to some people but I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: the candy store phenotype of jelly bean
smells like a candy store at the mall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like jelly beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like powdered candy and then
it's got a hint on the bottom of white
[SPEAKER_02]: grape juice or maybe peach juice is what I
think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are very distinct phenotypes that
are known.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to buy a 10 pack of jelly bean
seeds and you grew them out, hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd get five males and five females or a
ratio somewhere close to 60-40.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you got six girls and four boys or
the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you keep flowering them out,
you're gonna find one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll say you've got six girls now to
flower out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably gonna find one that is not
the desirable phenotype and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably gonna find one that's the candy
store and you're probably gonna find one
[SPEAKER_02]: that is the orange phenome and then you'll
have others to play with that'll be in
[SPEAKER_02]: betweens and really close and whatnot but
you'll find that if you've got six seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you'll find the candy store and the
orange phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really identifiable phenotypes
that you can find in a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that when I used to grow heart of
gold, there was the chunky girl phenotype
[SPEAKER_02]: that I used to look for and the mean girl
phenotype and then there was the golden
[SPEAKER_02]: goat phenotype which wasn't my favorite
because it looked just like golden goat
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had bred it from golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't wanna reproduce golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chunky girl just grew big fat chunky
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called her a chunky girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: She stayed real short and got real chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mean phenome, the buds looked real
sharp and the leaves were real jagged.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super serrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looked mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, it looked like an
aggressive, I don't know, it was just the
[SPEAKER_02]: bad guy looking one in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like it had attitude in a good
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another good example, gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla glue number four is popular but
also gorilla glue number seven is popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you see different numbers at the
end of strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because they were different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens is a guy like me will grow a
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep talking about a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most breeders sell a five, a 10 pack,
or maybe a 12 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people doing 13s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, most of the time you run about
10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives you a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you good numbers to work with if
you've got a small grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a breeder, if you're doing
commercial stuff, you wanna go much larger
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what will happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll run 10 seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, you're gonna get
about a 60-40 ratio of boys to girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're gonna flower the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the times you do that,
one is undesirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just cut that fucker down,
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You throw away all the clones and then you
keep your two favorites most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you gotta narrow it down from either
your two or three favorites to find that
[SPEAKER_02]: best one.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Josie Wales is the person who
bred gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that was on purpose or an
accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legend says it was an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna give the dude credit either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He found two good phenotypes out of the
seeds that he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many seeds the dude had.
[SPEAKER_02]: He coulda had three seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had at least seven, because there's
gorilla glue seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had at least seven seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of that, number four and number seven
were obviously the keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took those and made clones of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then obviously spread them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's gonna wrap up my rant on
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna segue me into a phrase that
is called clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me, what does clone only
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clone only means that the breeder bred it
and never put seeds out of it and released
[SPEAKER_02]: it in clone form to his friends or through
a forum or online or at a cannabis cup or
[SPEAKER_02]: at a farmer's market or however it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeder just never let out seeds,
so it was clone only because you couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: get it in any other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now since cannabis has been so
commercialized and legalized and the
[SPEAKER_02]: revolution is happening, a clone only
strain, they're getting adulterated and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting what is called reversed
and they're making seeds from plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: only have a female plant through asexual
breeding through a process called
[SPEAKER_02]: reversing the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking, let's go with a popular
strain that we all know and love around
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go with golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat was made by a guy known as Mr.
Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Dank pulled out seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an accidental project.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an accident, which is funny
because a lot of the best strains are
[SPEAKER_02]: accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the gorilla glue was an accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: The golden goat was admittedly an
accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the chem dog strains were accidents,
but let's stick to the point here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat, Mr. Dank accidentally
pollinated some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pulled the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He found golden goat in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also found another one that was known
as funky bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whatever happened to funky
bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen funky bitch on shelves in
dispensaries in Denver, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if that's the cut because funky bitch is
also a song that fish covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fish didn't write that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you're into fish and you
think funky bitch is a fish song,
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't write that one, but I wanted
to name a strain funky bitch after that
[SPEAKER_02]: song because I fucking love fish and I
love that song.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get down, somebody already done it,
and then I did research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Dank is the one that fucking started
that name, so he gets the credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was funky bitch and there was golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't put out any seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else got any of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he even grew any more of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no info on that legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody brought golden goat from Topeka,
Kansas out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got cloned like a motherfucker and it
got put in every dispensary everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat is an awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden goat, until I got my dirty little
paws on it, was a clone only plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't get it any other way except
through a clone because Mr. Dank would not
[SPEAKER_02]: give out seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows who Mr. Dank is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of lives in the shadows because he
grew weed in Topeka, Kansas, so it was
[SPEAKER_02]: clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what clone only means.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's jump forward where everybody in
the world is trying to start a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company and everybody wants to make seeds
and everybody's got their own agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guilty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm talking shit like I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm part of this crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like myself have learned how to
take a female plant and treat it with a
[SPEAKER_02]: product and turn it into a boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that boy plant contains all of the
chromosomes of that genotype, but it does
[SPEAKER_02]: not have any male chromosomes because it's
a female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just stressed it in a way to
produce female parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to produce pollen that has no
male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take that pollen from that golden
goat male that was a female that is known
[SPEAKER_02]: as a reversal, and I will put that pollen
onto a true female golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds that come out of that,
the progeny, will be feminized golden goat
[SPEAKER_02]: R1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a reversed one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are going to say it's an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin and I have been talking about it a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to call it an R1.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an R1.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our R1 golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast world, I do need to
interrupt myself and make a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said some shit wrong and I didn't
realize it until I listened back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I take that golden goat plant and I
reverse it and I put that pollen back onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the golden goat female, I am actually
selfing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am making an S1, the first selfed
generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I take that golden goat pollen and put
it onto a different plant, that is when I
[SPEAKER_02]: am making R1s, which is also known as a
reversed F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of said that backwards,
but here I am correcting it, so let's get
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the current show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until I put my grubby little paws on some
silver thiosulfate and my golden goat
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, golden goat was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what clone only means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's really fucking up the medical
world when people are growing seeds of
[SPEAKER_02]: golden goat and they're finding phenotypes
that lean toward the island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian side, and then there are
phenotypes that lean toward the Romulan
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are growing those seeds and putting
them on the shelves and dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of fucks things up for people
who are expecting golden goat to be
[SPEAKER_02]: reliable every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope and you expect that when you go
to dispensary number two and dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: number five and you ask for an eighth of
golden goat, you hope it smells,
[SPEAKER_02]: looks, tastes, smokes, burns, and
medically affects you exactly the same
[SPEAKER_02]: from every store, but it's very
inconsistent when people are buying seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and finding different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that people buy seeds and grow and
find different phenotypes because you may
[SPEAKER_02]: not want the same phenotype of golden goat
that the next guy wants, but you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: want something very similar, but you'll be
able to find the one that grows in your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden the best, that grows to your style
the best, that maybe does something that a
[SPEAKER_02]: lab test wouldn't even pick up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does it for you medically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when you smoke that one,
your diverticulitis chills out or the pain
[SPEAKER_02]: in your fucking right eye stops twitching,
and there's no way we can see that with
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: That phenotype may be perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the other nine feminized seeds that
you grew, they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one phenotype, so that's why it's
great to grow from seed, but that causes
[SPEAKER_02]: confusion in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm partly guilty of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have kind of stopped making us feminized
seeds, partly because of that reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: partly because if we all made feminized
seeds, there would be no future of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would all be feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like if we just wiped out all the
dudes, it'd just be women and there'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: no breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sorry, ladies, it's a 50-50 thing,
but we need both of them, and I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's my responsibility to kind of make,
I try to make two or three times as many
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seeds as I do fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done feminized seeds in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge market for them,
but I'm getting way off topic here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clone only strains are things like Blue
Dream was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the stuff from California that
you hear about from way back in the day is
[SPEAKER_02]: clone only stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Sour Diesel was clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of great shit that is clone
only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl Scout Cookies was clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the best of my knowledge, Swerve from
the Cali Connection was the first one to
[SPEAKER_02]: put out straight Girl Scout Cookies
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeder never put out seeds,
but then we've kind of adulterated it and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys like myself, guys like Swerve,
we're going out and spraying plants with
[SPEAKER_02]: shit and making feminized seeds and
putting it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like those should be labeled a
little differently when you see them on
[SPEAKER_02]: the shelf at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should say Golden Goat R or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times, guys, if you see,
if you go to the dispensary or if one of
[SPEAKER_02]: your friends gives you a bag of medicine
and it says Screaming Tangerines number
[SPEAKER_02]: five, or if it says Bounty Killer number
six or something like that, if it says
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise number eight, you guys, my Arise
number eight is the winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had multiple Arise plants that I went
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a batch of letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise E was the winner out of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I came across Arise number eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had Arise number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was one that I just called
Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was Arise F1 is how they were
labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kept running batches of seeds
and batches of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I found one that was better than
the last, I would throw the last one away
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep that best one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But E and eight became the two keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fucking Arise number eight is the
champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see Arise number eight on a
dispensary shelf or anything anywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is my keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I chose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see different numbers on the end
of a strain, it's probably because a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower grew multiple of them and kept the
favorite phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see two different numbers on the
shelf, that's because the grower felt that
[SPEAKER_02]: those two were worth keeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's probably watching to see which
one people come back and buy more of so he
[SPEAKER_02]: can decide which one to grow more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he's waiting on the lab test to decide
which one is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to attach this to the word
phenotype, that is called a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to buy a bunch of seeds and grow
them and try to find the best one that
[SPEAKER_02]: works for me or find the keeper,
that's called a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is one of a grower's favorite
things to do is to do a fresh phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to find new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the potential to find the next
champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may have some shit that nobody
else has.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me wrap up a lot of these glossary
terms in one sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to create a new strain and I
will find my favorite phenotype and I will
[SPEAKER_02]: pass that one around as a clone only after
I've tossed all of the other seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, if there are no more seeds,
that means it's a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, space bitch number three is
clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no seeds released to anybody
but me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's only like five seeds left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So space bitch is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever get a chance to pick up a
space bitch clone, know that that came
[SPEAKER_02]: from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was phenohunted from my breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been going for close to 30 minutes
