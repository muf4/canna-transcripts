[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode 679 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to focus on a
couple of Patreon questions.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show that I label
the chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I get to talk about all the
fun shit that I did recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big shout out to my buddy
Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint joined me for a comedy show a few
nights ago and we had the time of our
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see, uh, Brendan Schaub,
Chappelle Lacey, David Lucas, and Justin
[SPEAKER_00]: Elliott completely blow the roof off of
comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see them at the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy works downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew Brendan Schaub was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the headlining act.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been bringing Chappelle Lacey on
tour with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch the fighter and the kid,
you know that Brendan is a headlining
[SPEAKER_00]: comedian and Chappelle Lacey, not Dave
Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say Chappelle, people automatically
think Dave Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make this one clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Dave Chappelle, Chappelle Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great comedian, but, uh,
everybody knows that Schaub was the
[SPEAKER_00]: headliner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold the tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, if you watch the podcast,
do you know that Chappelle Lacey was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the opening act?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasant surprise to see David
Lucas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that's his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big guy, short dreadlocks, really funny
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think David Lucas was his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Justin, Justin Elliott as the MC
was a great surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Schaub takes that guy out on the road
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't certain he would be there,
but it was great to see all four of them
[SPEAKER_00]: perform on the stage at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm a sneaker head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a lot of you don't know that I am
way into sneakers during COVID,
[SPEAKER_00]: during quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to go to concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't go to the comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invested in a sneaker collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are bored of hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are just finding out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a pair of sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for the perfect event to
wear these sneakers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Clint got a brand new pair of
sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got out of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we were walking toward the comedy club
and I saw this big squad of dudes coming
[SPEAKER_00]: just right down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they fucking own the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that guy in front is
Chappelle Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy right behind him is Brendan
Schaub's brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and those other two dudes are David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucas and Justin Elliott.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as my stoned ass looked up,
cause I was kind of paying attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic and walking and I was watching the
world and I looked up and I hear nice
[SPEAKER_00]: kicks fellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was my buddy, Brendan Schaub
complimenting my shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was ready to go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't need to see any comedy at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd made the highlight of my night,
but, uh, we went into the comedy club and
[SPEAKER_00]: those gentlemen rocked the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how much I was missing
comedy shows, live comedy, human
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Brendan Schaub,
uh, Chappelle Lacey, David Lucas,
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin Elliott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to my buddy Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a big special fist bump to everybody
at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some friends that I've worked
there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made some friends that just started
working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, big respect to all of you folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the club is just getting back on their
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were closed for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody's learning their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, half the staff is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's adjusting to new protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in Denver, if you're
anywhere, I do recognize you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend catching a show at the
downtown comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough rambling about this shit
that I get to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about it and give my
friends a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give Clint the comedians and the club a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's better than cannabis and
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a couple of things,
but cannabis and comedy gets stoned and
[SPEAKER_00]: laugh at some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like shaking off all the stress of
the week, letting go all the bullshit that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened for a good hour and a half,
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't think about anything but that
funny dude on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think shop's a great dude, no matter if
you like his comedy or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a great time going to see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take some pictures with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I got our pictures with shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a picture with Chappelle Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can't go wrong after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Chappelle Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shop doesn't need any support,
any shout outs, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great dude, but Chappelle Lacey is
up and coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one that we should mention and
keep our eye out for shops already famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got shows and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for Chappelle Lacey, S H a P P E L
Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is how I think you spell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Dave Chappelle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, people are every time I said
Chappelle, uh, somebody in my crew was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you saw Dave Chappelle?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't say Dave Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Chappelle Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too excited, but get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more notes going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the podcast has been ranking high on
the audio servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of notifications
from Stitcher radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ranked very high on Stitcher radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ranked very high on Apple in the Apple
podcast application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've been ranking very high on pod
bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Spotify, the podcast has been getting
noticed on the audio platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to everybody listening on
the audio platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it and I appreciate it,
but I do invite you to join us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The YouTube numbers are what really count
when it comes to advertising and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would appreciate it if you just give
me a subscribe on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to push the show to 10,000
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate love and respect to
everybody who subscribes to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're watching, if you're
listening on Spotify, Stitcher radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, please just go to the
YouTube channel search, grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast and just click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe click like on a few videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do invite you to watch the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do put a lot of work into the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice this video and the previous
video are only one camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the other camera is having some,
uh, adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting a little blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's still under warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get that back, we'll go back to the
multicam set up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing stressful, nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gear breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that camera was acting weird anyway,
so I'm glad I'm glad I got to send it back
[SPEAKER_00]: here to a little, uh, refurbish a little
inspection, see what's going on with that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but only one camera for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last episode I'm a transparent,
no one camera is being weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, send it to a repair tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the multicam,
but I invite you to check out the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel because I'm doing a multicam,
a 4k show with cool intros and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more quick topic to cover
before we get to the main topic of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I was wearing a
brand new Irene genetics, orange Gazm
[SPEAKER_00]: hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of responses to that hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Irene genetics.com,
click on the Irene store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take you right to the store
where you can buy those hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did replenish them, but they do sell out
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want the orange Gazm hoodie or
any other Irene merch, they are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website at Irene genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised you that would be the last bit
of rambling before we got into the main
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do
[SPEAKER_00]: have a message that came from all of this
content for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will always be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that even if I were to die or
something, the podcast would still last
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we pay for the website,
the website comes out of a bank account.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bank account has got a good chunk of
money in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the website will keep getting paid for
for a few years until that bank account
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bank account is attached to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys pay Patreon, the bank
account will get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll pay for the website, which will
pay for the server to keep all the shows
[SPEAKER_00]: up forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the show should live forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube won't take down the videos ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the information should be up there
forever for free, which I think is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling because I'm still let me get
myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours
listening to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast while gardening and your practices
have impacted mine more than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm helping you out that I'm making a
difference and also that I'm helping you
[SPEAKER_00]: pass time and kind of get through the
workday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working in the garden sometimes can be
tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit stressful and it can be
exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in there in your ear keeping you
motivated, that could keep you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I'm keeping you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad I had some impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know that the work I do is
impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is impactful a word?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell Christina that it sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I'm talking about,
you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am working with mutants in the
Australian bastard cannabis freak show and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali seeds hops cross families.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend here is working with the
Australian bastard cannabis and freak show
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Cali seeds hops cross families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very familiar with the Australian
bastard and the freak show that Cali
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're talking about to
be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may have seen pictures of the
freak show and Australian bastard
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look a little bit more like a fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like some kind of different
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look like the traditional
cannabis plants we are familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in most gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently one is Australian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both of them have the freak show
and the Australian bastard have Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow quite strangely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, before I get sidetracked, let me give
a big shout out to Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drew grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try that sentence again without any
editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC grew some freak show cannabis and it
made some mutant trichomes and she was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get them photographed by a
wonderful photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC for some great trichome photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up in much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good cannabis teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a good powerful person
in the cannabis industry in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Trey K.
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were I?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Australian freak show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian bastard freak show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here they are all slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says bastard seems 60 percent of the
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaks are at 70 to 80 percent of the
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are low potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a pain in the ass plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's only novel to grow
once or twice and then you'd probably get
[SPEAKER_00]: over it if that's all accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm thankfully not
working with any of the very weak original
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals, but newer, higher potency
crosses that are still only in the high
[SPEAKER_00]: teens and cannabinoid percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's low teens and
cannabinoids, how are the turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the buzz when you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the numbers are low, but how is it
when you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the crew enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'd like to ask your thoughts on
what irie genetic strains you would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend in order to bring up both vigor
and potency of these mutant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often have called Arise King Solomon the
fixer plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first obvious answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me let me back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is not happy with the
performance of this plant, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for something to breed it to to
enhance the lacking qualities,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the potency and the vigor and
the growth structure and rate of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that King Solomon or Arise would
be a beautiful plant to fix almost
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, which is why I breed with it so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find plants that are nines and you
pollinate them with King Solomon and they
[SPEAKER_00]: become elevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first answer is obviously going to
be Arise that will increase your potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will increase the vigor, that will
increase the the structure of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the the sturdiness, the amount of
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do a lot of good things for that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say Arise would be my number
one choice because Arise has given me the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest lab tests I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise grows the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a winner all around and I call
it the fixer because it kind of goes in
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like this is cool on your traits,
but how about we just fix this and it like
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things I would recommend though,
and I always say it's about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that your goal is to fix this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend Arise right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to fix these plants and
improve their performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing your goal helps out a lot,
but what kind of turps are you after?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of buzz are you after?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of flowering time are you
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that stuff doesn't matter, then just do
the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something flavorful with some
funky flavors, I would recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry Butcher or the Blue Raspberry
Truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will both breed crazy turps into
your offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blueberry Butcher, the offspring you
breed from that may be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to grow because it's got that
jack-the-rump ripper in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those progeny were a little more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow taller, thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got that sort of haze thing to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those may be difficult, but they would
correct the problems coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the things that you bought
from your bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the things that it is lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blue Raspberry Truffle is half Arise,
so you're going to get the improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: from Arise, plus the vigor from the
blueberry cookies, plus the turps from
[SPEAKER_00]: both of those strains added to your
bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be some amazing flavors
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would say Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to increase potency and growth
speed and vigor and plant size,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom is quite often overlooked for
its impressiveness, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got great turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like lemon-lime Gatorade powder and
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking tremendous, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces super rock-hard, super dense
buds that are covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it Sonic Boom because when you
smoke it, you're like, Sonic Boom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your whole brain goes, oh shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so high that you need them in it,
and then you try to go do stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the neighborhood's vibrating and
lighting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really potent weed, so that's why I
call it Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend it breeding to the Sonic
Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom would breed great to all kinds
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to fix a plant,
Sonic Boom would be a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's go the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things I've been talking about are
more on the Skinny Leaf drug-varietal type
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna give you more of that head buzz,
that longer flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we took this Australian Bastard
Cannabis and your Freak Show, and we cross
[SPEAKER_00]: them to a Morning Dew?
[SPEAKER_00]: My Morning Dew is more one of my Indica
dominant crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more on the Indica side, the wider
leaf, chill you out, sit you down,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you cross it to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would give you some good turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd give you a nice growth structure,
and it would improve the vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think it would definitely improve
the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Morning Dew may be a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, if you want to get crazy,
let's cross it to the Machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Machine grows so big and so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Machine is one of the biggest plants
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the most nugs, it's got big
gigantic leaves, it's got super stank to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it's also kind of lanky and
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would speed up your plant,
and it would make it bigger, but it may
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a little bit stretchy and viney.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to find out is to find the
phenotype you want to breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe find a really short, squatty,
male Machine plant, and hit that freak
[SPEAKER_00]: show, hit that Australian bastard and your
other hop looking plant with a short,
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty Machine phenotype, and I think
you'd make some amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really though, it's all about seeing the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often ask me, a lot of episodes
have been people asking me for breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance and breeding advice, like,
hey, what would you breed this to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what would you breed to this to fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is seeing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I could make good recommendations
knowing the Mendel charts, knowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: history, knowing the pedigree,
the lineage, the genetics, the breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can predict and anticipate a lot,
but without having grown these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: without seeing them, without touching
them, without smelling them, without
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing how they respond to the
environment, without just being around
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I am not certain what are the best
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, and it sounds crazy,
I'll be walking through a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll just be watching the plants,
and I'll go to that grow for a few times,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll say that one plant on the end
corner gets my eye every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll ask somebody on the third or
fourth visit, like, hey, bro, what is this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll tell me that's this,
and I'll say, that plant will work
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully to my Jack the Ripper,
and I'll get a clone of it, and I'll cross
[SPEAKER_00]: this to Jack the Ripper, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Full success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something intuitive in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: After doing it for so long, so I say,
learn about breeding, learn about your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, learn about each plant that you're
going to breed with, learn about the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, learn its traits, learn how long it
flowers, learn what it enjoys,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the female plants you're going to
breed with, what are they susceptible to,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are they resistant to, how do they
react to certain environmental stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do they react to your abuse,
learn all of the plants, then learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: allele charts and Mendel charts,
and learn about chromosomes, and learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about DNA transfer, learn about progeny
and memetics, and then, then forget all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and breed with your intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds completely crazy,
but I know how to read music, I know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to write music, I know how to think about
my posture and my finger grip and where my
[SPEAKER_00]: foot's placed on the pedal, and how my
back is straight, and how my arms and
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders are aligned on the drum kit,
and I know how to think that the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to count compound time,
and I know how to think where the bass
[SPEAKER_00]: player and the guitar player are in the
music, but when it comes to playing music,
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget all that shit, and I play what
sounds really good, because I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: enough experience to rely on myself and
know that I know how to make the right
[SPEAKER_00]: choices musically, and I can do that with
breeding plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were on stage counting one E and two
E, and the music's going to sound like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, but if I go up there and go uh,
ah, uh, ah, we can all dance and it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like a really good time, so learn the
things that you need to know, get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: education, a solid foundation,
then you'll be good at it and do it
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortably, and I kind of think that
breeding, my breeding works that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sort of like I, I say that like I'm a
plant matchmaker, I'm a cannabis porn
[SPEAKER_00]: producer or something like that,
I just, I can see it, and I just know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of, when I'm going to cross
plants, I can tell you pretty closely to
[SPEAKER_00]: what the progeny will be, I can give
predictions, and most of the time my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding predictions are fairly accurate,
and that's just from doing it so long,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like being a chef or a musician,
you've been in the kitchen, you've been on
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage so long, you throw your hands up
in the air and suddenly magic happens
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're so experienced at it,
so I'd like to give you really good
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding advice, I've given you a few
strains to choose from, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the Mendel charts, learn the plant
biology, learn all of that stuff as deep
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can, then forget it all and use
your intuition by looking at the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: touch them, run them, rub them,
smell them, like that's what really
[SPEAKER_00]: matters, we've got all of the right senses
to make all of the right decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose, your fingers, your eyes,
all of those things, just use those things
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the right decisions in breeding,
of course you're going to have to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: out, grow out those seeds to see if you
did anything right or wrong, but in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, if you're working with good modern
cannabis and you're, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to toot my own horn, if you're
selecting a male from my line,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find something quality,
you know you're starting with quality
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and it's going to be something
good, so you'll see improvement on the
[SPEAKER_00]: line and that is your main goal to improve
the line, so find something that gets your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, it's got to smell good,
taste good, look good, it's got to sing to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, it's like finding a date and I don't
want to be responsible for picking your
[SPEAKER_00]: date, I don't know what you're into and I
don't want you to blame it on me later
[SPEAKER_00]: when it goes wrong, so do your best to
make your best selections based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria that I have given you,
I'm quite rambly so I'm going to get back
[SPEAKER_00]: into this message, it says, I'm really
confident in your strains because every
[SPEAKER_00]: strain of yours I've tried, I have loved,
that kind of backs up what I just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: that my strains are going to work for you,
so respect, thank you for that and thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for trying my strains, they're all
dank as hell, stank like hell and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything except for, and then you list a
couple, grew like crazy and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to list a couple because those should have
grown like crazy for you, you just had
[SPEAKER_00]: small phenols or something, but it says,
head and shoulders above everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the Arise, Firefly,
Sun Kiss, Sunshine Girl, Dragon Punch and
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarlet Legonias and I liked Sonic Boom so
much that I bred it to about 30 of over
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 strains re-grew commercially in 2019,
I don't think that I had read that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the message when I decided to tell you to
breed to Sonic Boom, that may,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I got that far, so do that
again, it sounds like it's working for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, it sounds like it was a good
decision, we both thought of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that again, if we both think that's the
way to go, that is the way to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that is highly accurate,
unfortunately Donatello is sold out and
[SPEAKER_00]: discontinued and it is feminized,
so you would have to reverse that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to work with that, there's no
male to be found, the same thing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm, the Orangegasm is not
discontinued but it is sold out on most
[SPEAKER_00]: formats in most places, it will be back,
don't worry, but it is feminized,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you won't find a male in there,
you would have to reverse it and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized out-cross of these seeds,
which wouldn't be a problem, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know that that's your goal, it sounds like
you're looking for a male to pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: your freak show plants with, so I may sway
away or stray away from the Donnie or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm for the Femmes, the Blueberry
Butcher though is absolutely correct that
[SPEAKER_00]: it would throw down in that potency
department, also vigorous plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: super vigor, good potency, good terps,
it would do a lot of repairing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also you're going to find longer
finishing plants in there because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: haze history within those genetics,
so it says, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I think I told you what I think,
I think I spit out enough info on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, I hope you got some good advice,
it says, thank you again for everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you do, much love from Locomotive Medical,
my man Locomotive Medical, big thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great question, big thanks and
respect for breeding with my products,
[SPEAKER_00]: it means a lot to me that everybody out
there, it means a lot to me that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: trust my brand enough to breed with my
seeds, that's a lot, just growing it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: big dedication, a big commitment,
you spent money on a product, money's
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive, I know how hard you work,
you're sweating, you're doing shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to do for somebody that doesn't
respect you, that you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you'd rather go pet your puppy or
play your Xbox, I get it, so it means a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to me that first of all, you chose to
buy seeds from my brand, that does mean a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to me, you trusted them to grow them
and put in your garden, you've got them
[SPEAKER_00]: for nine weeks in flower, another five
weeks in veg probably, you've got my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for 14 weeks in your garden,
thank you, then you guys trust my product
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to breed to it, that means a lot to
me, your future gardens rely on my garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: my product, so that means a lot to me,
that does hit me, it's not left unnoticed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's humbling, it fills me with pride,
it gives me a lot of emotion, so thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, that means a lot to me, it inspires
me to keep going and make even better shit
[SPEAKER_00]: for you guys to breed with, that's the
only way to do it, I gotta stay ahead so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys can breed with good shit,
alright, I am rambly, I hope you enjoyed
