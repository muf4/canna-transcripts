the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends to support the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of supporting the podcast,
I am seeking questions for an upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I'm going to do an episode
where I eat too many edibles and I answer
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that are non-Grow related.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I don't try to abandon the
Grow questions on Patreon but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a Patreon only episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to eat too many edibles and I
want to answer questions mainly kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: about me, about my company, anything you
want to ask me that is not Grow related,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a good time to ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a question, now is a good
time to join the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send those questions to the Patreon
campaign and I will work those in to the
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upcoming edible episodes where I do
eat too many edibles and answer personal
[SPEAKER_00]: questions is kind of the idea that I'm
going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be personal questions,
it could be questions about dreadlocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be questions about shoes,
you know that I'm into sneakers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be questions about music,
anything you want to know that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis related, this is the format for
those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do join the Patreon and send me
those questions on Patreon because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the Patreon to do the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I'll get the questions from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also looking forward to my greenhouse
filled with seeds being harvested here
[SPEAKER_00]: within the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the greenhouse today looking
around and the seeds are coming along
[SPEAKER_00]: quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not been paying attention,
I do have a greenhouse somewhere that I
[SPEAKER_00]: will not tell you where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that greenhouse, I have done a little
bit of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a Jack the Ripper male and put
that Jack the Ripper male to 10 solid
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be 10 Jack the Ripper
crosses, some of which you are familiar,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of which will be brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to tease you a little bit,
there will be a Platinum Tangy pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be an LA Kush and we may be
making more Blueberry Butcher out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't say too much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already said enough, but I am getting
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep pulling seeds out every couple of
days and giving them a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the next two weeks, maybe three
weeks at the most, those will come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take me a while to get those
processed, packaged and out to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will be sending out test seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be sending out a lot of new stuff
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new great stuff coming up for
2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to brag, tell you how excited I
am about that greenhouse coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear that I got some greenhouse
dust in the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got some allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the vid again, but I do have
some, if you do hear it, that's just some
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor dirt and dust from being outside
too much today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that's from, excuse me for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to a
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine got his plants stolen
from his outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever heard me talk about outdoor
growing, I do always say plant a few
[SPEAKER_00]: extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to plant one for the thieves,
one for the bugs, one for the animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: one for the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe plant a couple for yourself and
hopefully you will get one or two of those
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got your plants, your outdoor
plants were stolen this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do send you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Condolences for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have love and empathy for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some sympathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful where you're planting your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are it's an inside job and your
plants do get stolen or you did not do
[SPEAKER_00]: enough security work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the plants right there at the
corners near the edge of the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't plant right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe be more discreet, but be prepared if
you're growing outdoors, that shit is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to potentially get stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a strategy that you're going
to follow if somebody does come to take
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not up to me to tell you what to do,
but keep in mind that you can grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants next year if you were not in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you're going to do,
be very careful protecting your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is the time people are out
stealing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that don't know they're not
ready are going to start stealing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next couple of few weeks,
plants will be getting stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get your plants taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, if your plants got stolen,
you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out fist bump, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could give you a fat plant to
replace that or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing I could do for you except send you
some love and a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better luck next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and the last order of business
that I wanted to ramble about is something
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of silly, just kind of personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've discovered over the past
couple of weekends that cleaning cloners
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably my way of cleaning my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my least favorite tasks when
it comes to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing all of the work that comes
the defoliation, popping, twisting,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting up the nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning the rooms is even fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing all the reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that work is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even packaging seeds is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like cleaning cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the easy cloner clone machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason, just cleaning those
is one of my least favorite tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what your least favorite
garden tasks are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that on the show here
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to tweet me, it's at GFYH
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to send an email, it is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know, what are your least favorite
garden tasks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could find some way to make those
more fun, make them better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's always better when you got
the Grow From Your Heart podcast rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I was going to read a
message about selecting nutrients here in
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from our friend Shotgun
Yoda on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Shotgun Yoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about an episode on how to pick the
correct nutrient line?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the advantages and disadvantages
of each?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a really in-depth episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to cover this kind of
tight, but you know how I get,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will get rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things to think about when
it comes to selecting nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important maybe is availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get it sustainably?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a one-time thing or is it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it readily available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to order it online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an Amazon purchase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a purchase directly from the company
or is it available at your local grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of those mean the most to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it available?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to matter the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you pick a line, if you
research a line and it's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: available, you can't use it, what's it
going to do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most important part is,
is that product, is that line available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one of the next things to think
about, this may be important for more
[SPEAKER_00]: people than others, but the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this product, is this line cost
effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to feed the plants
for nine weeks of flour, a few weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be cost effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your return on your investment going to
be worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some bottles are super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some bottles are really
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about, I'm buying a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to use one ounce every time I
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many waterings do you get per bottle?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times per week do you water?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much product do you expect out of that
product at the end, out of the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the math on that with each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've also got to factor in
electricity, the water that you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put in your time, your labor,
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay for trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay for scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor in all of that stuff, but think
about the cost of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they cost effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brands out there are really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brands out there are really
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you are paying for advertising,
colorful bottles, fancy labels,
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're not really paying for
what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when it comes to
buying your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the products you were thinking
about buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research the brand that makes those
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then research the other products that they
make and see where they get their products
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: See where they're sourcing their
ingredients to make your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies have great ethics,
some do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if you want to support
companies like Monsanto or Scotts,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend your money wherever you
would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of my business, but it is
something that you may want to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you may want to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cost is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something you may not have thought
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about sustainability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the products you are purchasing or
thinking about purchasing causing problems
[SPEAKER_00]: to the world or is that company doing
something to prevent damage to our earth
[SPEAKER_00]: and our world?
[SPEAKER_00]: We only get one world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only get one earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to us to not destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's my big hippie talk for the
day, but are the nutrients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: products you're buying for your grow,
are they sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to destroy the earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a product that we can continue to
buy and use for several years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a brand that just appeared
yesterday and may disappear tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to buy a brand that's been around
for a minute that I know is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: around so that if I do fall in love with
their products, I can get it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another part of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: First we've got environmental
sustainability, then we've got company
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these products going to be around in a
few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow the best herb you've ever
grown and then that product's not
[SPEAKER_00]: available next year, you're gonna be
frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it going to be available?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I'm gonna talk about is
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the nutrients you are thinking about
purchasing compatible with your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're growing hydroponic,
maybe you're growing cocoa, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing even flow, maybe you're doing a
living soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're doing a soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just growing an old dirt you
found in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these nutrients compatible with your
grow style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another thing to think about,
are these nutrients compatible with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we're gonna talk about
later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer if a new grower is selecting
nutrients, you pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand and get what you need from that
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend that you go get a base
from one company, a bloom booster from
[SPEAKER_00]: another, a root tonic from another,
a phosphorus thing from another,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those companies didn't talk to
each other and you may run the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: overlapping nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk more about that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got that written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that really matters is
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grew with these nutrients,
were you satisfied with the outcome of
[SPEAKER_00]: your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your bud look, smell, taste,
burn, smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you the buzz that you were hoping
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you spent all these weeks and all
these nutrients pouring into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things you're gonna notice from
the nutrients are flavor, aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be the first three things I
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor, aroma, and color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see during the grow if you're
getting good colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see if you're getting big fat buds
or little puny buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what about flavor and aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, I used another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to avoid bashing companies
here, but I used to use a company when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell you about 30 bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mix shit up like a science lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All their bottles have real fancy
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labels are really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every label's well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them in every magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was big and fat and huge and
dense and smoked well, but it all tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing 12 different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all tasted like strawberry bubblegum
because of the nutrients that I was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that it was that one
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of the bottles made it all taste
like bubblegum, but there was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their bloom booster really made everything
taste like this strawberry bubblegum
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I gonna grow 12 different strains
if it's all gonna taste like strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should've just grown a whole bunch of
one thing and monocropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get any variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste the way that you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see bud size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nutrients will grow more leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nutrients will grow more bud mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nutrients, I've noticed, make the
plants a little more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna name any brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brands will just give you a lot of
fat buds, but a lot of fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brands will give you big,
robust stalks and hardly any buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned this from just growing and
experience with nutrients over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what works best for you
with your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these results will be very
grower-specific, room-specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: strain-specific, environment-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else will fall into effect,
into play here in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a chess board.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole chess board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's 64 squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta get all 64 squares right,
but every one of those will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your results, not just the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay focused here because I am
quite dabbed, and I'm trying to read these
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get these nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to have them shipped to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe think about, are you getting
powdered or liquid nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting them shipped,
do you wanna ship water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because liquid nutrients are probably 70
to 99% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to buy powdered nutrients,
all you're paying for at that rate is the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not shipping water across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need to use a scale to weigh those,
which I don't mind doing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a scale half the day anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a scale, weigh those powdered
nutrients, mix them into the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: stir them up, super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they cost-effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they compatible with your grow style,
your plants, and each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most importantly, do you get
results that make you happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the very most important part,
is the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go a little bit deeper into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to work with organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wanna work with salts?
[SPEAKER_00]: How organic do you wanna go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How scientific do you wanna go?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of brands that do offer
organic products, and plenty of brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that offer completely non-organic
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you how hippy-dippy you wanna
go, how organic you wanna go.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I always remind people when they
say, I have to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be completely organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remind them that cyanide is organic,
and a little bit of cyanide will fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you that hung up on the word
organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, it is a buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things more expensive,
and it's unnecessary a lot of the times,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna be organic, if you think that
organic is the way to go, I am not here to
[SPEAKER_00]: argue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here to help you select what is best
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stay unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you information and
educate without pitching any brands or any
[SPEAKER_00]: products, because that bugs me when shows
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you buy this, and then they do
a commercial for it right at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show, and you're like, well,
that's why you recommended it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they paid you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anyway, do you wanna go
organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wanna go salt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wanna be hippy-dippy?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running organics, and you add
synthetic shit into your mix, you are no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say organic at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-organic is what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of the words that you made up to be a
combo of those is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic means organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put shit that's not organic in
it, you are now non-organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quit making up new words for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call it whatever you want,
but it's not organic anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, how about cost-effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you afford it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid or dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't wanna ship water across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want a lot of bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want a few bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some companies out there that
will sell you 30 bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one company that sells you three
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen great results from both brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kinda all about what you are into.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you want to mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much OCD do you wanna have over this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much control do you really want over
the feed of your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: The three bottles generally work as like
you got a base, and you got something,
[SPEAKER_00]: a microbe, and then you got a bloom
booster, and they just tell you feed this
[SPEAKER_00]: much of each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with your base, and then you start,
add microbes, and then cut out the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other companies that want you to
feed these two bottles on week one,
[SPEAKER_00]: this bottle and this bottle on week two,
these four bottles on week three,
[SPEAKER_00]: these seven bottles on week four,
these five bottles on week five,
[SPEAKER_00]: these nine bottles plus these two powders
on week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's companies that want you to do all
kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you what you wanna choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a company, like I said, that you
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You enjoy their ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time, before I ever grew
weed, I was reading magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think there was the internet
when I was dreaming about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at magazines, and I would
see brands, and they would be advertising,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of those brands would speak to
me, and some of them would not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably already drawn to a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already probably a logo,
a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard something that has got your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just think about that brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the ethics of that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they spend their money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many bottles do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got an idea, so do you
wanna go a bunch of bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wanna go just a few bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: This may really help with your decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much OCD and control do you really
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward from that,
because I rambled on with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sources and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are these companies learning to make
the nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the formulators, and where are
they getting their ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they using high-quality ingredients,
or are they using bottom-shelf leftover
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out where these companies are
sourcing the ingredients that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: selling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is something I started rambling
about earlier, and I cut myself off,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to get to it sort of here
at the end, closer to the end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to mix and match nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that, I mean you can use, and I'm just
gonna say names randomly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was gonna avoid names,
but you can use a botanic hair base,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can use new millennium
additives, or you could use a advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients base, and botanic hair
additives, or you could do that if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: careful to not overlap any of the elements
within those bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully read what you are feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
molybdenum, sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things I could just go
on listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of these things in our
plants, but company A, Advanced Nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: did not talk to botanic hair and say,
hey, we're gonna put this in the base,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't have to put it in the Bloom
Boost, or you don't have to put that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that this company didn't add
shit to that that's already in this
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that company A, if you buy all of
their lineup, you're not going to overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: things because they know that this product
has nitrogen, this bottle has phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: this bottle has potassium, this bottle has
all the other shit we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go adding a bottle from another
company, they didn't talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be doubling up on nitrogen,
you might double up on phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium or anything else, and then you
do risk the chance, the opportunity of
[SPEAKER_00]: burning your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get off on a side tangent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people often ask me about PPMs
and how much to feed the plants at what
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you a PPM number because I
don't know how many PPMs of each nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: you are using in that mix, and it is very
plant-specific when you get to the high
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM, high performance plant levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could feed the plants 1,000 PPMs,
and they'll thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also feed them 2,500 PPMs,
and they will thrive if you give them the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave them 2,500 PPMs of phosphorus,
they will cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave them 2,500 PPMs of nitrogen,
they will cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be a balanced diet of the
proper shit, then you can go real high if
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what you are doing and you have
not overlapped anything too critically.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I did get off on a side tangent
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was headed for is I would
recommend, instead of mixing and matching
[SPEAKER_00]: things while you are new, while you are
learning your nutrients, while you are
[SPEAKER_00]: determining what works for you,
is I would pick a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just pick whatever line you've
been studying, just choose one that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available, it's cost-effective,
it's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been getting your attention,
and we don't know the results yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your friends have had good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a good way to measure
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would get the base, the microbe,
the bloom booster, the CalMag if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and then see what else they offer,
because they all offer a couple of other
[SPEAKER_00]: different bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get as much of that line as you
feel necessary or as fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would water, I would feed that
entire crop, that entire run with that
[SPEAKER_00]: line of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do a solid test is to go
from beginning to end with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go adding in other shit,
we don't know what worked because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: adding anomalies, and then it's hard to
determine what did what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed it with that one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it give you enough weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it smoke well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, either research the next line you
need or find something to add to what is
[SPEAKER_00]: missing from the line that you have
chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use a specific line, but then to
that, I also add another brand's CalMag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I add a couple of bloom boosters from
another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I add another trichome and resin
producer from a totally different company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm mixing probably four or five,
maybe five or six different companies
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds in over the course of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is because I have started with
one base and I learned them and I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: with that one base a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, if I give it too much of
this product early, I get too much leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I cut this out, it reduces my leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get bigger, fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized these buds could
probably be a little fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added a bloom booster and then I
realized, oh, I missed that one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I was using before, that would go
well in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added that and it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just done it by starting by running
the original base several times,
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting my results, seeing what I
desired, and then adding one more product
[SPEAKER_00]: every run and documenting that and
comparing it to previous runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I get more weight, more potency,
more flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it better or did it, was it cost
effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I buy another bottle, feed it and not
get shit out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did I see results?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times I'll see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times I'll just stop using a
product all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep switching things up,
it is hard to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed that one plant, that same
nutrients for at least two or three runs
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how they react together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start making minor adjustments each
run after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe run six plants of the same strain
and feed three one thing, feed three the
[SPEAKER_00]: other and feed three the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just minor adjustments, maybe a little
more base nutrients, maybe a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do recommend locking in with one
brand to start getting as many of their
[SPEAKER_00]: products as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either afford or find necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to buy the whole damn lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm gonna do it, why leave anything
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get them all, get it going,
feed them, see what happens, do it again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make adjustments on that third
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanna add something, take something
out, that's when I will make the
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the last two notes that I have
on my sheet are run side by sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that one nutrient is doing
really good and you think another one is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing really good, what's to stop you from
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a six plant count, do three
plants of one and three plants of another
[SPEAKER_00]: side by side in the same room and keep it
scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can figure out which
lineup really does work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last note that I've got is some things
that work for me may not work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that work for you may not work
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our grow rooms are different, our plants
are different, our goals, our styles,
[SPEAKER_00]: our approaches are all very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're very similar, they are
still very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what works for me may not work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for your best friend may not
work for your worst friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: What worked for your girlfriend may not
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be open, be flexible, and pay attention
to the plants because overall the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
Paul and Chuckers, all of you beautiful
