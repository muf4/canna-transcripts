[SPEAKER_00]: I do also want to thank everybody for all
of the great comments on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the 710 episode did come out a
little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recording schedule is a little bit
chaotic, a little bit hectic right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to record the episodes and try to
time when they're coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I miss it by a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for the great response to
the early 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you haven't listened to
that, go listen to the 710 podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do talk about what 710 is, what 710
means to me, how 710 did evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great feedback on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really lucky that I did record that
show early because I tried to record
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday and I experienced a power outage
in my recording space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the transformer on my block
exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of flames came out of it for about
a minute and then it petered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the power was out on the whole block
for several hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no work done yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: No podcast recording, no seed packaging,
no editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No progress was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply jumped in the car and went for a
ride and tried to stay cool and keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: phone charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really lucky that I did record that
710 episode a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because last night I was unable to utilize
the studio space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are catching up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a power outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really lucky that I got that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all of the feedback on
that 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more stuff that I do want to loop
back and touch on on that 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that I may have missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was reminded because today I saw a
friend of mine went to a bodega.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live near a bodega, you know what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically just a small store with a bunch
of random products in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll find ethnic products
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll find off-brand
products in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of weird random shit in the bodega.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could survive out of there if you
need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a convenience store,
but also a bunch of random items in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, one of the members of the iry army
today did pick up a dab rig complete and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to use for $35 at a bodega.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think you've got to spend a ton
of money on a smoking device on a good dab
[SPEAKER_00]: rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got rigs that cost, well we don't
need to talk about dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got expensive rigs and more
affordable rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the rig I hit the most is
one of the more affordable devices in my
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It functions well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a lot of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the dab in the banger,
I put the carb cap on it and I inhale,
[SPEAKER_00]: that rig punches me in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a right hand right to the jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the other rigs hit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid a lot of money for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fancy design.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of function, but they just don't hit
like the simple rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I wanted to talk about is
small, practical, affordable rigs are very
[SPEAKER_00]: good for an entry level dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you've got to spend a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something kind of small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not buying a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying a dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference in smoking a dab
than smoking a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke the bong, the idea is to
light the bowl and smoke until you get
[SPEAKER_00]: that big glass chamber, that big space,
all that area filled with the volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you carb it, you pull the bowl or
you pull the carb and then you suck and
[SPEAKER_00]: then all that smoke goes into your face
all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that big bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're smoking dabs, we don't need to
burn the flour and smoke for so long and
[SPEAKER_00]: fill the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need smoke, vapor basically,
to go through the water to cool it down so
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't roast my esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I need it to get into my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really trying to fill up a big
tube and clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of manage that enough with the
carb cap by filling the chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: the little, the can on the rig and just
fill it enough and keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like a big bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going for a big bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the big bong, you gotta smoke
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep inhaling and inhaling and
you don't even get any smoke until you
[SPEAKER_00]: finally pull that carb.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the little rig, as soon as I put my
dab onto the banger, as soon as it hits
[SPEAKER_00]: the dab nail and I start sucking,
I'm getting a fat dab to my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are gonna cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go red-faced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a smaller, practical rig is ideal for
especially a new dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use is a very small,
practical rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need a lot of perks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of swirls, a lot of twisties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to be a recycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy my recycler rigs, my encycler
rigs, my fancy shit, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite rig doesn't have any of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're gonna get a rig, don't think
that you need to spend a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the glass sellers out there right now
are going, damn it, Jeff, we're gonna make
[SPEAKER_00]: some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get a rig that functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a flared-out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mouthpiece is too little on a rig,
I take a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get built-up concentrates on
my lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a flared-out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like something about hand size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before, I like it when I go to
take the dab that I can look at the banger
[SPEAKER_00]: and not go cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be cross-eyed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a smaller rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other things that I did not mention is
that you're going to need a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna need some way to torch that
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a torch?
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually just use a creme brulee torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newport makes a good torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of great torches out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't have to buy the super
expensive torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those expensive torches will die just like
that cheaper one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the torch that fits your budget
that makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you're gonna need is a
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a rig, you've got a banger,
you've got a torch, the next thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: need is a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to scoop up that
concentrate and put it into the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would recommend a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A carb cap that fits the banger and goes
kind of deep down inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using a turp slurper,
most of my advice will not work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of the turp slurper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community may roast me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a big fan of the bird feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do anything good for me and my
dabbing style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly prefer a flat top banger,
round bottom, flat top with a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my preferred method of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carb cap will definitely increase the
quality of your dab all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I recommend is Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you're done dabbing,
grab a good quality Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get the shit that melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cheap Q-tips will melt, get good
like glob fathers or dab mops or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good quality Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you go to Dillard's and go to the
makeup section, those Q-tips, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're makeup Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better quality than the shit you
use in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you're done dabbing,
grab that Q-tip and clean out the residual
[SPEAKER_00]: oil or the residual wax in your banger and
that will help you keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I recommend some rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to clean that dab
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your tools are going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: 91% isopropyl alcohol is your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I did recommend a
product called Dark Crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Crystal is available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product if you can afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think I'm crazy when I say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instructions say to heat it up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works so much better when it's hot and
you cannot heat up the alcohol as hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably, but I'm not going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But heat up the Dark Crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit will clean your glass quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I'm going to recommend,
they don't pay me to say this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you want a really nice and smooth
dab, check out the dab right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just basically set your banger above
it and it'll measure the heat on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of your banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell it, I want to dab at 650.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's 650, that fucker beeps and you
take your dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rig that I use most of the time,
somebody on YouTube asked me, what is that
[SPEAKER_00]: rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig that I was hitting on the previous
episode was a Hitman sidecar with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hammerhead perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by a company called Hitman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a sidecar because it's got a
can and the mouthpiece comes off the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hammerhead percolator on the
inside of it, which means the downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: goes straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes to the left and to the right
and it's got holes facing the left and
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had it here to show you, it'd look
like Thor's hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Hitman sidecar with a hammerhead
perk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for that,
it'll be hard to find because I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're making those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman, however, is coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your local glass shops, check their
website, harass them on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I going next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a bong is what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already talked about why not a bong,
why I prefer a little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the torch is not something you're
comfortable with, or maybe if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be traveling a lot, maybe the torch
isn't for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving and hitting, torching a dab nail
is kind of challenging unless you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that, wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a puff co, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little better for you if you're
not into the torch, if you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: discreet, if you've got kids in the house,
or if you're going to be smoking in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car, that dab torch and the hot banger in
the car can get quite dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not super coordinated,
if you are clumsy and accident prone,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe consider something like the puff co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're clumsy, you'll burn the shit out
of yourself with the e-nail, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to mess with the torch and it's
always there ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that's a good recap
of the things I may have missed on the 710
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I got you up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any more stuff that I missed,
of course, please do send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get the updates on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about more grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently asked a question that I'm
asked a lot and I don't know if I address
[SPEAKER_00]: it enough publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've said this enough to
where people know my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only am I a podcaster, I'm also the
breeder for iReGenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own iReGenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make high quality regular and feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody asked me today, again,
how do I feel about people breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds that I have created?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always had the same answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I will always continue to have
this attitude and the same answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the answer is go ahead and breed with
my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you acquired my seeds in an ethical
way, if you didn't steal them or rip
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody off for them or lie to somebody
to get them, if you got them in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: way, I give you full permission to breed
with the seeds that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not territorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I guess territorial is the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not possessive with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the seeds I bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or let's talk even further down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent cannabis in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that Willie Nelson and Bob
Marley invented cannabis in 1952.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know that, read the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did not invent cannabis, which means
I did not have seeds to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just sneeze and have male seeds
and sneeze and have female seeds or sneeze
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a male plant and cough out a
female plant and start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get seeds and plants somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with other breeder's plants
and other breeder's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I wasn't using other breeder's shit,
then I would not be breeding or working
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, every plant that I use had to
come from somewhere to get me started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, I give you permission
to breed with anything that I have put out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of stipulations and
maybe a couple of by the ways with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool if you give me credit
when you breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed to my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a cross and you put it out or
you talk about it on social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be kind of you to say,
this is my, whatever you're going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to call it black
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is black microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my this cross to Rasta Jeff's
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell people it's the iRegenetics
cross in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you're a new breeder,
if you're getting started, that may give
[SPEAKER_00]: you an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that just shows shows respect and
gives me credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells people what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never ever in any way for any reason,
change the names, change the stories and
[SPEAKER_00]: change the crosses of your stuff,
of my stuff, of any stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding, tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know what plants were used to
make that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are using cannabis as a
medical remedy and they want to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics they are smoking because it will
have certain effects for certain ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people that won't smoke a
sativa like, nope, I'll be too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people that really love
certain strains and really hate certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stay honest with the labeling and
let's not change any names.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important when you do go
breeding with anybody's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us credit, honor us,
honor your elders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it shows a lot when you reveal
your source.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll hear me say,
I learned this from this person because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also not a weed genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of mentors, a lot of
teachers, a lot of people around me and I
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb information very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do not think I'm the wizard of Oz or
some cannabis guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read a lot and absorb a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do give you full permission to breed
with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I'm going to ask for is if
you do go breeding with my stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe create something and then breed with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got to work with it to breed
with it, but if you're going to put stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out to market, here's what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on putting, if you're going to
make seeds for yourself, have fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: do whatever you want, breed them,
Paul and Chuck, share with your friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on putting seeds out to the
market, this is what would be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just take my, what's popular right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard about the cross fist
bump, you're missing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out, iregenetics.com slash ire
dash direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll get you there, but check out
ire direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a pack of fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is sour diesel to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got yourself a pack of fist bump
and you want to make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a male or a female out of
that pack of fist bump and breed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: something else and make your own starter
male and use that boy for your seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't just use my fist bump and find a
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start a seed company off of my fist
bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can if you want to, but it would be
more polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be more yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took a male fist bump from me and a
female plant from any other breeder out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and crossed those, then you find
your male out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use that male for your
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of, that does, that makes you do
a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that means that that just shows that
you care, that you put some pride into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you put some effort into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't just buy my shit and then just
start using my shit to start your own
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are going to say, Rasta Jeff,
you're making Jack the Ripper F2s off of
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, Subcool was somebody that I
feel was my mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool taught me a lot about this
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool taught me what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I always say Subcool taught me a
lot of what not to do as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, as a cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a lot of mistakes, but he also
made a lot of headway.
[SPEAKER_00]: He carved the path that many of us are
walking now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt that it was my responsibility
almost to make a tribute strain to Subcool
[SPEAKER_00]: when Subcool passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Subby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You honorary motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Subcool's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took it upon myself to continue some
of Subcool's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool does not make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool, a lot like myself, was an F1
monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple of killer males and he
would pollinate everything with those
[SPEAKER_00]: males and it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had a good plan, a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Subcool would tell you, if it ain't
broke, don't fucking fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subcool was continuing on that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool would have never made F2s of Jack
the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill may have inspired that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill may have thought about that along the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's more that way in breeding,
but Sub would have just kept making new
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sub was never gonna make the Jack the
Ripper F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does something special to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me lit in a way that I really like
and it honors a good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: my mentor, my hero who has fallen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I just mentioned Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jill, for a long time, was,
I think they may have been married when
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a rocky relationship is the best
I'll say right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill wouldn't mind me saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they were separated,
but still married when Sub passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Miss Jill was a big part of TGA,
Team Green Avengers, which was part of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what Subcool Seed Company,
it was Subcool and Miss Jill, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were other people involved also in
TGA, but to the best of my knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub and Miss Jill were the core of TGA,
the Green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after Subcool passed away,
I did the responsible thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to my friend and fellow
breeder, Miss Jill, and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, do you care if I work with Jack the
Ripper?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna make F2s and I wanna make a bunch
of outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done with Jack the Ripper and Sub's
obviously done with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got our blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing with Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did my work with Jack the Ripper with
the blessing of the widow of the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: who made it, who was also involved in the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I've got permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my, it's grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got grace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did what I needed to do to keep the
relationship strong, to keep the business
[SPEAKER_00]: strong, and to not feel like a dickhead
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like a dickhead about it,
you know inside that's when you are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong ethically.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so yes, you can breed with my
seeds, but follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect the breeder and pay homage and
tribute to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then don't go breeding with just my
straight up male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some work, find your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the work, sell those seeds if
that's what you choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I should mention,
bro, I like seeds too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making shit with my crosses,
send me a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, I'll take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just might grow your seeds out,
find something cool and breed it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my other shit and then send you
more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes that way sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get gifts in the mail all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I like clones of keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow some of my seeds and you find
a good keeper, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell the breeder, hey, this is what I
want to do and see if they have a project
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to what you're going to do lined
up or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may end up getting to work with the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder, a lot of us are really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communicate with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us have our own discords,
our own social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're weed growers and we're bros too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what we are up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing I've already
mentioned, don't change the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a story behind every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's details behind every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody gave you that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody gave you that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody knows the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this cannabis story real.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much bullshit behind the
cannabis plant, behind the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, cannabis lore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the internet now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got enough resources to clear up
bullshit and keep things real.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a podcaster, as a breeder, just with
the mindset that I've got, I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a cannabis historian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my responsibility to make sure that
strain details, cannabis history,
[SPEAKER_00]: that all this shit is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So help me out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't fuck up the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't convolute the story of your plants,
of your strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, you don't have to chime
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't make some shit up and do
not change the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to breeding with my seeds,
that was the long rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short version is fucking go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage it because it's kind of an
honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're going to use my plants as
breeding stock, that's saying that I made
[SPEAKER_00]: good enough shit to where you trust in it,
that you want to breed to it because you
[SPEAKER_00]: like it that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like saying my beats were funky
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted to sample them for your album.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do breed with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another thing I do want to talk
to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody today asked me in a Discord chat,
big shout out to my friend who asked me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, if you could use any plants for
breeding, what two plants would you
[SPEAKER_00]: select?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was a very good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer though was probably not what
everybody was hoping for because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have two plants in mind that I would love
to breed because I can't just tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to breed to some shit because
of the names of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like apricot, cush, and fucking vanilla
sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably taste and smell really
good, but that's just two names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that have to do with those
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with the plants other than names
that some person arbitrarily labeled these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pick my breeding pairs by seeing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll be growing out some seeds,
looking for a female and I'll see a male
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and I'll go shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't looking for a boy, but that dude
right there has got to go into a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got another male coming up that we're
having a hard time getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running some more phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a hard time getting rid of
some bulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're showing such potential and
it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to choose plants just based on names
and things without actually seeing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for a breeding project, I don't think
that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like just scrolling through the
phone book and picking a boy name and a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl name and putting them on a date and
hoping that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to actually see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the plants in early flower,
mid flower, and late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what they look like just
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what the buds taste and
smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know the density of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know the buzz that it gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what happens if the room
got too hot, if the room got too cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I took off too many leaves,
if I didn't take off enough leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know a lot of details about
these plants before I choose to breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just knowing by the name isn't really a
way that I would choose to select my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about ways that I actually
would do it because I don't want to shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: down your question without a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I've got a King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the terms Indica and Sativa are
kind of outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going away, but if you were
going to label it as an Indica or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa, my Arise, my King Solomon leans a
little bit Sativa, but he's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of 60-40, but he's real close to
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a great buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's kind of 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got the Jack the Ripper male who
is real Sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real Sativa heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 70-ish, 75-ish percent Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got the BC Lemon Skunk male,
which that's a lot of Sativa, which just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight lemon funky flavors and a real
particular growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were going to pick more plants to
breed with, right now I would be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for a really short, squatty, broad-leafed
male that finishes in like eight weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: produces gassy, skunky aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like a Moon Tower male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's more couch-locky because
everything else I'm making is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a head fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like panic attack weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to broaden the catalog, to bring some
new shit in, maybe I need something more
[SPEAKER_00]: mellow, more indica dominant, is the old
term we used to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some big, broad leaves, some gassy aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that funky, gassy aroma that maybe a
hint of those burnt tennis balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that and then breed that to all of the
other really sweet, tropical,
[SPEAKER_00]: candy-flavored females that I've been
collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Strawberry Starburst, the Golden Goat,
the Lemon Skunk, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Skunk female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a Lemon Skunk male and a female,
just because I'm sure it does get
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing from totally different breeders,
different batches, but I should mention
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the thing I would be looking
for now would be more of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad-leafed, indica type of male that
finishes in eight weeks because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very different than everything else that
I've got in my catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're breeding, things that are
very different is when you have great
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that would work well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a Moon Tower male or possibly a
cream male may be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a cream male hidden
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check on the website first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow up for details.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that includes you.
