[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call these Thursday episodes,
the Thursday Quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
Quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with the Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me for another
Thursday Quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too far, let me apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my voice sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is a little rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I smoked a whole bunch of
joints with our friend Baker at
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a great weekend up there at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast by talking
about what I've been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I was smoking flowers this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not known for smoking a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm known for smoking a lot of
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weekend, I smoked dog waltz and star
dog flowers grown in the Three Rivers
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial Grow, grown by myself and my
grow team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole grow staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everyone at the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I've been dabbing on this Lemon
OG live resin from our friends at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm gonna crack open the jar and
give it a smell and try to give you a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells, so it's Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very lemon smell to the top of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you crack it open, it smells
like sweet lemons, sweet, sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very strong lemon smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, often when I talk about lemons,
I talk about that dry lemon smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lemon head candy or like the
Country Time Lemonade dry powdered smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a wet lemon smell and not in a
bad way, like a juicy lemon smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like a Jolly Rancher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you put a Jolly Rancher in your
mouth and it kind of makes you drool from
[SPEAKER_00]: that lemon flavor, it's doing that same
thing to my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of giving me the lemon essence,
Jolly Rancher candy, wanna drool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want a Jolly Rancher candy real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's doing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got that lemon smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once you get past that sharp
punch in the face of lemons, there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: hint of like cushy gassiness, earthiness
at the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just blends really well with the
lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemons kind of mute out the gassiness,
but the gassiness brings out the lemons,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my friend, Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole crew at the Garden
of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For hooking me up with some delicious
lemon OG concentrates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now that you guys know what I'm
smoking on, let's get some business out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you need to add some new
genetics to your garden, look no further
[SPEAKER_00]: than the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visit them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I owe everybody
listening to this podcast a huge thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is available on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is available on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm talking about my website,
let me apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website right now is mainly used to
host the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it needs a lot of updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply don't know how to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I did know how to do it,
I don't know if I would have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for the shitty looking
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the podcast is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, my website, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: available on dozens of other random
podcast hosting sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now iTunes and Stitcher and YouTube are
pretty much the statistics that I pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at my website sometimes,
but you guys don't listen on the website a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like iTunes and Stitcher
are the most used services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ladies and gentlemen, I was blown away
when I checked my statistics on Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: last week because the show in the month of
February has already reached over 90,000
[SPEAKER_00]: downloads on Stitcher alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to reach over 100,000 downloads
for the month of February.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't paid much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've hit 100,000 downloads
in one month before on one service.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for downloading and
listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought that this little show was
going to get listened to by 90,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been overwhelmed before and this is a
different feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is motivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought that a large football
stadium worth of people would download my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all 90,000 of you that downloaded the
podcast on Stitcher this month,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll reach 100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident that I will reach 100,000
downloads on Stitcher this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: To all 100,000 of you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you're not listening on
Stitcher, if you're on iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're on PodBay, if you're on
Podcaster, if you're listening wherever,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it and I am blown away
that this podcast has gotten this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we're almost to 300 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stoked to make it to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away to make it to 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 is really gonna mean something and I
see no end in sight anytime soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 90,000 downloads on Stitcher,
that's what I wanted to brag about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, we're gonna hit 100,000
downloads on one service this month,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys keep listening, I promise to
keep bringing you quality content.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna talk about what I did over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I get to keep coming on here and
bragging about all the cool shit that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I don't mean to brag, but I gotta
brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weekend, you guys, I got to go see
Uncle Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see Joey Coco Diaz at the finest
comedy club on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Joey Diaz was at The Comedy
Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there all weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold out two shows every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to the early Saturday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Saturday, I drove up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a nice parking spot over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right or square, I head into the comedy
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get myself some pretzels and a root
beer, and I get all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedy show comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The host at Comedy Works that night was
Aaron Urist, who is always hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opening act was a comedian named
Elliot, who I am spacing on his last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it until I started recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna press pause and find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys, I can't find his name
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Elliot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a regular at Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a very tall guy, and he was very
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get to see a tall guy named Elliot
at Comedy Works, he's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, Aaron Urist opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron's always reliably funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elliot, I've seen a couple of times,
always reliably funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after Elliot's set is when the party
really got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I listened to a podcast called
The Church of What's Happening Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where Joey Diaz gets to do most
of his ranting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's joined by a producer named Lee
Syatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee also produces the Good Times podcast
with Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to host his own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was part of another podcast with Johnny
Rock called Life in Neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Lee has been a podcasting engineer
and producer in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a few years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also becoming very well known in the
podcasting world and the comedy world
[SPEAKER_00]: because he hangs out with Steve Simone,
Joey Diaz, Ari Shaffir, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in that comedy realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, the dude has started
writing and doing comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to his podcast that he's on,
you know that he's very new into comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's only got about seven minutes of
time total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I happened to be paying attention to
him on Twitter and on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept saying that Lee was coming
to Denver with Uncle Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't know if he was going to come
do stand up or if he was just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Friday night, he did not do stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't expect anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Saturday night, after the emcee and
after the opener, they brought out Mr. Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: Syatt, the flying Jew, to come do a few
minutes of comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did about three to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried not to watch the clock too hard,
but I did try to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did about three to five minutes and I
could see how visibly nervous he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude crushed it for how new at comedy
he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just a shy, nervous person in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see that dude talk about doing
comedy one day on the podcast to I went
[SPEAKER_00]: and did my first open mic to he talks
about I did three minutes the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to see this guy make the
biggest level up in his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee just jumped levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee has now performed at the Comedy Store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee has now performed at Comedy Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on stage and crushed at the two
best clubs on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to Lee Syatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, holy crap, I was so excited to
see Lee come do comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually pulled a move that I don't
think he realized how smooth it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the one of the acts before him told
a joke and I'm going to kind of ruin the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy's material, but I won't ruin it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He invented a new name for giving a woman
blue balls and he calls it flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a quick premise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee actually came out on stage and talked
about himself for a minute and then said,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never flooded anyone's basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a comedian to pull something back
like that is gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that Lee Syatt is about
the height of a bar stool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude might be four foot two or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a short little man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed to see how tiny he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Lee did about three or four minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he did the honors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shifted from his material into,
all right, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm from the church of what's
happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he brought out Joey Coco Diaz,
who is one of my top five, maybe top three
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite living comedians that I've ever
fucking listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey makes me laugh until weird parts of
my body hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey makes me laugh until weird parts of
my head hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure what part inside of me was
giving me a sharp pain, but I was laughing
[SPEAKER_00]: so hard that I almost wanted to just stop
laughing for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to like, oh, how do I snap out of
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was uncomfortably painfully
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was laughing my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to pee, but I thought I
might piss my pants from laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he introduces Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, when Joey walks out on
stage, he comes out with the most
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just walks out on stage and he just
looks at the crowd like, what's up
[SPEAKER_00]: fuckers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does this really cool strut move.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's 53 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Cuban.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from North Bergen, New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got this East Coaster vibe to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he comes out on stage and he struts
and he grabs the mic and he goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up you bad motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that club fucking erupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have seen no shit,
50, over 50 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Doug Benson 20 times at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have been to over 50 shows at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe closer to a hundred shows at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Joey Diaz gets that place roaring like
nobody fucking else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only person that got close was
Chappelle and it's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that Joey Diaz brings,
it feels like the roof is going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: off the fucking building.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll have you in stitches laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll tell a punchline and you'll be
crying laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're holding your gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'll throw a tag onto that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one more little, and so then I did
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, oh shit,
it can't go any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'll make another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, oh God damn it,
Joey, you better stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'll let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll just pause and stare into the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he knows, I don't have to say
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking laughing their asses off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paid to make these people laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let them laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as the laughter starts to
kind of, you know, people laugh like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ha ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get the, you do that weird
inhale noise laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going to settle down and
you're not laughing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as people do that noise,
he grabs the microphone stand and picks it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He picks it up about three or four inches
up off the floor and smacks it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he does it, it's like the fucking
troublemaker kid at school just got caught
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something, but doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, ah, I'm going to get detention,
whatever it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're all laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does that and it's, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cheap ass comedy move, but it's
genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's if it were disingenuous, I would call
him on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just Joey's way of going,
ha, look, you bad motherfuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're friends and we're laughing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so fucking funny when he does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll hit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll tag you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll tag you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you finally think you're coming
out of that water and getting air,
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll slam that microphone stand on the
ground and go, ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're busted again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking laughed so hard at uncle Joey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey told Joey tells some filthy jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey has a dirty mouth and a dirty mind,
but he's honest and that's part of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, Joey told a nice long story
that was tremendous and people were
[SPEAKER_00]: offended and people were disgustingly
laughing or like, I can't believe you just
[SPEAKER_00]: said that shit in front of 250 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Joey, that shit you might want to
keep private.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's laughing and he's making
this face that he makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He opens his mouth and shakes his head so
that his bottom jaw flops back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks at you like, ah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he goes, it's Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hear knock, knock jokes for
that man to realize that we were at our
[SPEAKER_00]: limit and then just try to push us a
little more is just so it's so amazing the
[SPEAKER_00]: way he works a crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey brings energy that nobody else
fucking brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to see Joey again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there was another show
afterward, so we didn't have the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: outside smoke sesh that we usually have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things had to be a little more contained,
so it wasn't a big party like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did have a very good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my friends at ComedyWorks
that take very good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I keep saying it and they don't
pay me to say this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for all of my ComedyWorks tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for all my food there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sponsor me in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that everybody, wherever you
are, go see comedy at a comedy club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go support live comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go support a comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be one of the funnest nights you've
had in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like that's
enough bragging about my weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: enough talking about comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually read an email that has
something to do with some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from our friend Ben
Osborne and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts off right away and says,
feel free to use my name and the name of
[SPEAKER_00]: the company that I work for if you read
this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ben, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes life so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, this one's from Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Rasta Jeff, let me start by thanking
you for everything you don't know you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost two years ago, I decided to get
into the cannabis industry as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had terrible luck growing anything
throughout my life, killing just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that with proper knowledge and
enough effort that I would be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love for cannabis is a very strong
driving force.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you know the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes sir, I certainly do know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, after all, it saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hired at the clinic about a year and
a half ago as a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of about three months ago, partially
thanks to the knowledge that the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: has bestowed on me, I made it into the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, congratulations because I always
talk about everybody having to start off
[SPEAKER_00]: as a trimmer and you were proving exactly
my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got hired as a trimmer, you showed
that you knew what to do, you showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could listen and show up on time and
now you worked your way up and you were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations dude, I'm glad you have
made that step, level up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, Rasta Jeff,
thanks to you, I am able to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: with the people on my team with confidence
that I would have otherwise lacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you're able to use the
knowledge and information that I've given
[SPEAKER_00]: you and communicate with these people and
I'm sure that when you said specific words
[SPEAKER_00]: and said them in a certain way,
that they realized, hey, this guy knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what he's talking about and it got you
some respect in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, I'm glad that worked for you and
I'm proud of you for jumping up so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna continue with the email,
it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the main reason for this email,
I recently went to the Grow Off Awards
[SPEAKER_00]: party in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won first place in yield and flavor
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, congrats, that's a huge award if you
won best yield and best flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good job, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email also goes on to say,
Phylos Bioscience had a display with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylos Bioscience Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say that again, you guys,
Phylos, P-H-Y-L-O-S, Bioscience Galaxy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Phylos Bioscience Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you were the first person I
thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a website that shows the genetic
ties between cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds a lot of information aside from
genetic ties such as breeder name and
[SPEAKER_00]: novelty score.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is galaxy.philosbioscience
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned that this isn't anything
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone is able to get in touch with them
and add genetics to the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the contact information of a
representative if this is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in adding your genetics
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for everything you do for our
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aire has been one of my favorite terms
since my trip to Jamaica in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I shall really use it for the first
time with someone that can appreciate its
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always Aire, Ben Osborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ben, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there wants to send me an
email, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will read your message on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the Phylos Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am very aware of the Phylos Galaxy
because my grateful dog is actually part
[SPEAKER_00]: of their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin Gordon from the Ethos Collective was
kind enough to get my sample of grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: dog into their database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read genetics is actually included in
the Phylos Bioscience Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite parts about the website
is an algorithm where you can put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and it can show you strains that it
has not been bred to and strains that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is genetically very far from that would be
good breeding ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This website knows what genetics are
making up each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can tell you, so it recommended to
me that I breed Girl Scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the forum cut, to my grateful dog because
they were so genetically far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have any similar parents that
it would make a very unique cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it recommended that to me on the
website, which I found to be very amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had already made that cross and
it was fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call it Burning Spear and it had
already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I need to send a Burning Spear
clone to Phylos so that they can get it in
[SPEAKER_00]: their galaxy and show that it has been
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the great things that
the Phylos Galaxy does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think of it as like an ancestry
.com for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of like a family tree for the
cannabis plant and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really great website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you guys are not breeders,
if you are just interested in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and you want to nerd out a little
bit on cannabis, I definitely recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you go check out Phylos Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just poke around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get into the galaxy, you will
start clicking and you will be there all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ben, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving me the opportunity to
share Phylos Bioscience with my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis genealogy is very interesting and
once you start looking, you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing all the strains you're familiar
with and then you'll see what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed with and then you'll want to know
what those were crossed with and you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: there all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ben, thanks again for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to
your emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the email address is
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a couple of quick shout-outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shout-out to my friend Roger
S, also Juan R and Kelvin Medina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout-out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if I don't start wrapping it up
soon, this will not be a quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this show wrapped up.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics,
I-R-I-E underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check out the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 160 videos up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get more coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very time consuming.

learn how to financially support the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off
of podcasting, but hosting the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost a little bit of funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping all these microphone covers fresh
takes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes equipment takes a shit on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this MacBook is starting to
slow down and piss me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost time for a new MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the Patreon contributions will
be used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody who's helped me out on
Patreon in the past.
