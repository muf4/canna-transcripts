[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 472 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This evening, I've been smoking
Dogfighter, full spectrum extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Starfighter and
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, the flavor is described as
sour, fruit, and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely agree with the fruity
fuel part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I get the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a delicious and impressive
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bust it open so I can talk
about the appearance and consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three perfect dab-sized diamonds
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were four or five diamonds in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to crush them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take them as individual dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that this gram will be five
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just enough terp sauce in here to
make it delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the container, it says that
this product does contain 60.95% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure that the remainder of that
percentage is mostly terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product smells delicious and
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the impressive Dogfighter,
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read some
customer reviews from the Apple Podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get there, I would like to do
some shout outs to a few of our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to JM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you shout out
to Blackbird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out and thank you to Tyler
[SPEAKER_00]: R.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big fist bump and a shout out
to our friend Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to Zoso J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want to send a giant Grow
From Your Heart podcast shout out fist
[SPEAKER_00]: bump and thank you to our friends down at
Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to Richard M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to send a shout out to
Darren W.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast shout out thank you and a
fist bump to our friend David O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, big giant thanks to everybody
who has supported the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show, you can do so by visiting www.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I did say I was
going to read some customer reviews from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Apple podcast application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get there, let me make a quick
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new update for my computer and
my computer recording software and my
[SPEAKER_00]: recording hardware are not getting along
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't want to be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've restarted both devices a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to download patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: These devices want to butt heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some weird editing points in
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize in advance if there is any
weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would use this episode to read
Apple podcast application customer ratings
[SPEAKER_00]: and reviews instead of trying to put out a
grow lesson that may possibly have errors
[SPEAKER_00]: in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use this episode,
this recording session, this editing
[SPEAKER_00]: session to figure out what is going on
with this software so that I can bring to
[SPEAKER_00]: you a quality grow lesson in the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's jump right into some Apple
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast application customer ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening to the podcast on the
Apple podcast application and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to leave a review on the show,
it is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply open up the podcast however you
listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using your Apple iPad or your
iPhone, you probably open the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll to the available episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep scrolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after that, and then it will show
you customer ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you an opportunity to click
on an amount of stars which you feel I
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody has given the show five
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any reviews that were not five stars have
been deleted because they were deemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be spam and spiteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are standing at nothing but five
star reviews at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But click the amount of stars which you
feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then leave a review about the podcast and
let other people know what you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump right into the first
Apple podcast customer review of this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have read this one already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't remember the last review
I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came in on August 6th from a
person who calls themselves iryarmy619.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot read the full headline of the
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off with great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the thing gets cut off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a full review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff is the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: His love for the plant and cannabis
community are very evident in every
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that means a lot to me already.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole podcast oozes passion and
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both new growers and experienced growers
can learn something from Rasta Jeff and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is my exact goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to teach the new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep the experienced growers
entertained while I'm doing it and remind
[SPEAKER_00]: them of their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hitting my target, which means a
lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps going by saying, keep bringing
the amazing content and I promise to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: listening and sharing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your friends about the show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, PS, if possible,
please bring more content about outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for our friends in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the most experienced outdoor
gardener, so I do need to get some friends
[SPEAKER_00]: on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually harvest season at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe by next year we can get some
outdoor growers to come on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse has spent most of the grow season in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well deserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our buddy,
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he is back, maybe we will get him on
the podcast to do a little outdoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to open up the next review now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the way that this application
works now, but we are going to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm clicking, I'm clicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on August 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person calls themselves Dawn Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left us a five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says an awesome podcast and
easy, but then they cut off the headlines
[SPEAKER_00]: on the new application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't see the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we can read the full review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, Jeff, great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the podcast and all of the positivity
and great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I are in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come by sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I like that, Dawn the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in Colorado Springs quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have to link up on social media so
that I can stop by and dab you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your garden and leave some seeds
so that you can grow some iry genetics up
[SPEAKER_00]: there in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the five star
rating and I look forward to hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: at some Colorado Springs dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Event.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next review was left on September 3rd
by a person who calls themselves Levi son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their headline was nice and short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did give us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I listen to the grow lessons,
I take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to refresh the page because the
review just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stop making podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're full of knowledge and it's always
great to hear someone new and don't give
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be listening till you get to
episode 1000 while 1000 episodes would be
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost up to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm about 25 away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what number we're on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 28 episodes away from being at 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 1000 is a reasonable goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not see a reason to stop recording or
making podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as people keep listening,
as long as the service is still available.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they don't make some weird
legal thing or some changes to podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have to be paid for,
or I have to pay to do it, then we should
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the show going forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a reason to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if they do make me pay to produce
podcasts, I will still do it because you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys support me quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've supported me for so long,
but I would still continue to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it did cost me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost me a little, of course,
to host the website, to have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and all that, but Patreon covers
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep going with this review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope you don't give up and keep
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not plan on giving it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason to give up podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of passion for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every episode I put out,
I get at least 12 or 15 replies on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: from people saying, great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get a bunch of emails from people
saying, wow, you really solved my problem
[SPEAKER_00]: in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no reason to stop doing the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some more reviews to get
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on September 16th of
2019 by a person who calls themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: Dean221.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that because it fits in a little
short spot they give you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our new friend gave us a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am opening the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to refresh the screen again,
because for some reason, the reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you click on them, you got to unclick
and click something else and then go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That review is still not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a blank space where the review
used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just popped back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I sound crazy, but if you're
playing with the Apple podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new update is a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're doing a test run with
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, most informative and
entertaining grow show ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is my hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of scary, but I do appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, I'm brand new to stealth
growing personal medicine and I listen
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 63 and I feel born again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63 and feels born again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to this podcast and to being able
to grow personal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite review of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I want to reiterate,
Jeff is so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just checking to see if I can get Jeff
another good review.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a fascinating listen best ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I delivering quality content,
but this person feels that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize I was an interesting
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that I've got some cannabis
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that I talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did not realize that other people
found me interesting outside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is really refreshing, reassuring
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, but it feels good
and it gives me confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again for saying that I am an
interesting person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I realized that people find
me interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our new friend Dean221
who of course left a five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of more reviews left
here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm talking really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame that on a little bit of
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whole lot of dogfighter dabs from
our friends at Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review was left on September 28th of
2019 by a person who calls themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell if that's Mevan or Melvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Emma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Mevan818.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the review says give
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they gave us a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast has something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm hitting the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said before, I want to get the
new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the professional growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the commercial cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the cannabis activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody involved in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that I'm hitting that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, or they say, I love the grow
episodes and the push for activism to free
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a veteran who prefers organic
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for what you have done
for my garden and especially for the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are growing quality medicine
for yourself with my guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't talk a lot about organic
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a bottled nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, everybody knows I like veg
bloom and new millennium nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my favorites, but I will get more
organic knowledge on the show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope my cultivation knowledge,
my grow lessons are helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will work more on getting some organic
based, organic focused info out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, big thanks to our friend
Mevan818.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are growing some great
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you're a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe you a thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am able to do what I do because you did
what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's cannabis related, I really
avoid talking about politics on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't share my political views or ideals
on this podcast because that is not what
[SPEAKER_00]: this show is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the idea of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do appreciate and respect our
soldiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate, I respect, and I am grateful
for anyone who puts their life on the line
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect people, freedoms, or anything
that they believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big respect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get off this little weird
soapbox I've just created and let's keep
[SPEAKER_00]: reading reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your service and thank you
again for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more review on my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a person who calls
themselves Hobbit Feet DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to anybody from the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already checking out the
Dude Grows podcast, I highly suggest you
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available on Stitcher,
and of course they are available on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a great resource for cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows show, of course,
is hosted by a dude known as The Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is backed up by a guy named Scotty
Real, and they've got a partner in crime
[SPEAKER_00]: that they call Guru, who keeps all the
audio equipment running, who keeps all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the video equipment running, and chimes in
with very useful horticultural knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is very well educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the man has been to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell he is passionate about
cannabis, and you can tell he is
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of my boys from
the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check out the Dude
Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become part of the Dude Grows crew,
and then join us at some of the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: events that we throw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They throw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put myself right in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us at some of the events which we
throw throughout the year in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get my high, rambly ass back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Hobbitfeet DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give us a five-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, wonderful podcast,
so we gotta give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a bunch of great headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus in and read the rest of
this review from our friend Hobbitfeet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the review just disappeared off
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the best growing podcasts
for beginners and experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that that is the theme of the
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great show for beginners and
experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me that I'm hitting my
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you set out to do something
and you're not sure if you're getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: right or not, and a bunch of people say,
best for beginners and experts and your
[SPEAKER_00]: whole goal was to get for beginners and
experts, that just makes you fucking dance
[SPEAKER_00]: in your chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am dancing in my chair right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing a little boogie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even try to visualize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes, I've learned so much and
laughed along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a bad student in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got ADD like you would not believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can tell just by listening to
me speak that my attention goes crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love filling my brain with knowledge and
useful facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to learn the dumb
useless crap that we keep repeating in
[SPEAKER_00]: school and I had to learn over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach me something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expand my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hated school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few teachers that made an effort
to actually teach us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't just reciting shit out of a
workbook and making us fucking do
[SPEAKER_00]: assignments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were making an effort to be teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: To shape us as people for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those teachers, I remember them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them were funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them had a personality with which
I could connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it should have
been, but those teachers are the teachers
[SPEAKER_00]: that made an impact on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the teachers that stood in front of
the class and droned on and bored the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember any of those teachers or
their classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few teachers I remember
vividly because we connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you connect with me a
little bit, if I connect with you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, I can teach you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of laughter makes you put
your guard down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get comfortable with me and then you
want to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put down that uh, school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You forget that you're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're laughing and you're absorbing
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a little bit of laughter
and a lot of education is a perfect mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm really hitting my goal with that
and this review makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry I got so rambly about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Jeff is an awesome human being and
White Mike is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that White Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody thinks that you are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get you back to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get you back over here and get
you on the podcast bro because people
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously enjoy your presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review just disappeared off of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to refresh so we'll get it going
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say this podcast has it all
stay ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Hobbit feet thank you for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys these were great iTunes podcast
customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying it but it means a lot
to me to know that I am perfectly hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to teach everybody to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put a little bit of laughter
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the pro growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the activists and the
advocates involved and it really feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like that White Mike and myself have
really hit my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everybody who is
listening.

[SPEAKER_00]: the reviews that I've read in the past and
any other service.

or Stitcher and I'm not reading them still
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for those reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read some comments and reviews from
YouTube in a future episode but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a couple of emails that these
episodes are not people's favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather me focus in on grow
stuff which does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grow from your heart podcast

to make sure that my recording gear is
[SPEAKER_00]: working after a couple of updates.
