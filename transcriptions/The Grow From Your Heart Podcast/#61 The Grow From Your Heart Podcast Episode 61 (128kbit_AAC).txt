[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what's up cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 61 of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My headphones went right across my fucking
headphone thing right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just went fucking strikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that was miserable in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still recording?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm going to go back and don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to relay what just happened here is
he literally turned off every switch and
[SPEAKER_00]: put his headset down like something he had
to poop or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it pretty much runs itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden our illustrious host
just wigged the fuck out and started
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting buttons real fast and flipping it
switches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do know now, but at the time I was
like, Oh God, I had a head injury recently
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know if that's coming back on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked intensely painful and scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two chords touch that should not ever
touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, dude, it made the most painful
sound across the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we've been here before we've
been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need to put some duct tape
or something or watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just move this over to here and we'll
try to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause dude, that was crazy, man,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard the noise, but neither me
nor my carton was laying right across my
[SPEAKER_01]: input right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right across there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked and I was like, it was,
it was just going in my ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, I felt like it was happening in my
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could feel it through my spine and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, stuff about cannabis and shit's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have, we're going to have a
laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a Wednesday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, Wednesday, Tuesday, that's
Wednesday for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that song I started to play before I
had a crazy, great technical issue was
[SPEAKER_01]: from the mystic roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm way off rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read a podcast ad and we will get
into the show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, don't spit that Mountain Dew on the
computer dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to ruin everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes another fun sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what he was going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just taking a big ass chug of that
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Dew number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, high grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a store in a Pueblo called high
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: High grow indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have great prices on growing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well organized shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well organized shelves and a couple of
beautiful, um, clerks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're called.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sales associates and Jesse is
included in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Adam helps load the truck sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's beautiful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to high grow indoor growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Denver, go to the Denver
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 6271 beach street.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Pueblo, check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 618 East fourth street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I wouldn't represent a company
on my podcast that I didn't love with my
[SPEAKER_01]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, high grow is my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a great, great store.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you tell them you're listening to the
podcast, they'll give you a fatty bo baddy
[SPEAKER_01]: discount.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will give you commercial pricing on
your entire order and it's fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll save you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I just open?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this gorilla glue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to take some gorilla glue
dabs, but before I do that, I got to read
[SPEAKER_01]: this next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also big, huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love to our friends at the Rocky
mountain worm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like I said before, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only rep companies that I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use the Rocky mountain worm company
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got, uh, dragon flight earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got, uh, sea crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have got fish hydroslates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask, they'll probably give you a
tour of the worm farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how the worms are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's four 11 Tijuana street in Colorado
Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to travel or if you're
out of state, they will mail you worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will mail you dragon flight earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will ship to your front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think you can get live worms or
worm, uh, what I forgot what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, the baby worms, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the website pulled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have been more prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll mail that shit to your door and
you can use all the shit that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, dude, I'm going to have to teach you
about microphone stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headbutt them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot fight with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's keeping that red thing in your face
where we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be that microphone stands friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a Zen moment with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, go to Rocky mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm company.com and they will mail you
cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay for it, but they'll mail
you cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of love to hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really hard to rob places through the
mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when they're sending you poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you get in the mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy box of shit, shipping on this shit
was straight from the rocker mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best shit on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's grown right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to sponsor the show,
I do do way better ads on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Wednesday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a little funky today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an equipment error right at the
beginning of the show, so it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a chaotic episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go just 30 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to sponsor the show,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you all squared up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a product you want me to
test out, we like testing out new shit on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show, but be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more email.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need an official email of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have an official email of the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one was a gift and a hookup
from my good friend Giddy at Emote.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Gmail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be real specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike needs an email?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike himself needs an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would never leave the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have no reason to come over here
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would come over here to get shattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seriously been considering an
inverter for my car for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that online and I cringed a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised you don't have one.
Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a passenger that can hold on to
it, so nobody gets burned, it'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put it in the cup holder,
your elbow is going to hit that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a ring right there
and you're going to need some apothecanna
[SPEAKER_01]: pain cream to rub on that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be on the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first car fire for what we
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful, but then I think about the
lady who hit autopilot in the RV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walked into the back of the RV and started
taking dabs while it was driving down the
[SPEAKER_01]: highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's only a matter of time before
some fucking dabbed out moron burst into
[SPEAKER_02]: flames sitting in a parking lot somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be that one guy that ruins
it for everybody, but hey, until that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy, gutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody got my gutter reference,
you get a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: TCU, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Gorilla Glue, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sponsor the show or anything,
but I got some tasty Turpex Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter from Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sponsor my happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This smile has been brought to you by our
good friends at Turpex and Green and
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was well put, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hunt and his Womb Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, get that meat wallet tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you guys are pulling out all the
stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of hashtags.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a hell of a chaotic
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some order to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got three news articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is get through three
news articles and then we can have fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to do one right off the bat
while I choke on this giant dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just took a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably time to get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read commercials and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so let's get down to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a click.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing the clickety clicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for the cough in the mic,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am more professional than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely has that glue taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that Gorilla Glue dab tastes
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, when you set that down,
make sure you don't cross the strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, put that right on my cable here so
that I can go deaf for another 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the funniest shit I've seen
in weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't tell if he was having a
seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get up and walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: My body told me get up, walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take off your headphones and walk
away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I feel when you're there,
heating it up and scraping the e-mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem to save that shit for when I come
over and it's like, oh, he loves this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Adam's favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to do it in the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to do it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody and half the people on the
planet will have a seizure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to read a news
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, one surprising downside of
marijuana legalization, major energy use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a picture of we got
three, two, five, seven or eight lights
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging in a little grow facility here
with the ballast up on the ceiling just to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of show you a nice little visual of
electricity being ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says, oh, this article,
I better give some credit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Mooney from the Washington Post
wrote this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, across the country, there's a
growing trend toward the legalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four states, Oregon, Washington,
Colorado, Alaska have voted to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: people to possess limited amounts of
marijuana for personal use and also to let
[SPEAKER_01]: producers apply for licenses to produce
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: DC also just voted to allow personal
possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this on top of the 23 states that
allow it for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some states, we just read two different
articles that gave me different numbers on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't we once had 20, once had 23?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe they were taking it different
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're dabbing also.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way this gets counted up is confusing
because since that second Sanjay Gupta
[SPEAKER_02]: special, there's been a whole bunch of CBD
only states across the South.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pseudo medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you count that, if you count that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if the number's a little heavy,
it's about 25 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that was making the big fuss in
New Jersey was just in the news today
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to go back at it like,
oh, blood money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep this article going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Christie being all fat and crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be just a meme.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to be the governor of Florida too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, like I've, or his brother or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's just another man who ain't never
going to be president.
[SPEAKER_01]: Order in the court.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some states where businesses are also
now legally cultivating and producing
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, a mainstream industry is
emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana sales totaled $700 million in
Colorado last year for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam, how much of that did you spend?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first three months that I was
here, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted a picture on Twitter the only
time I bought legal pot last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could pull that photo up and get
exact 60 bucks if that was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 125 on the first at the greener side
dispensary, but I've bought a lot of this
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter from green and healthy lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2015 is going to be a different tale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got all this black cherry chem
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran a lot of black cherry chem and it is
tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little heavy on the indica side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for daytime, it's a little bit much
sometimes can't glob out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's see $700 million in Colorado
last year for instance, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out that indoor marijuana growth
in particular, a cultivation method often
[SPEAKER_01]: favored in the industry for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given that this new industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like the state and local
policymakers have a unique opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate energy usage and climate
assessments into their state marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing fees, says Gina Warren,
a professor at the Texas A&M University
[SPEAKER_01]: School of Law, whose paper titled,
Regulating Pot to Save the Polar Bear,
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy and Climate Impacts of the
Marijuana Industry will soon appear in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia Journal of Environmental Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sentence was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anybody else catch that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said pot and polar bears in the same
sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made some interesting pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw a polar bear like running
through a field of pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought that that was like an
obstacle of a sentence to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were so many punctuation marks in
that statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole paragraph was one sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That entire paragraph is one sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a comma, a comma, a comma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ellipse and then another comma and then
a period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so much punctuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good writing and props.
[SPEAKER_01]: The published statistics on energy use
from indoor marijuana production will blow
[SPEAKER_01]: your mind whether or not you use this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a 2012 study of carbon footprint of
indoor cannabis production published in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Journal Energy Policy, researcher Evan
Mills noted that on occasion, previous
[SPEAKER_01]: unrecognized spheres of energy used to
come to light and marijuana is a textbook
[SPEAKER_01]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study estimated that indoor cannabis,
both legal and illegal, uses six billion
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars worth of electricity every year,
amounting to 1% of overall U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some production intensive states
like California, it was much higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: 3% Mills found.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't read into this article much
further, but I'm going to assume that
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is going to hit like 5% of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're killing it on the indoor
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that would hold Colorado
back from that would be there is less
[SPEAKER_00]: people here than something like Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the percentage of our overall usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one average kilogram of final product
is associated with 4,600 kilograms of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon dioxide emissions to the
atmosphere, or that of three million
[SPEAKER_01]: average U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: cars when aggregated across all national
production, wrote Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is simply the technology
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific energy uses include high
intensity lighting, dehumidification to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove water vapor and avoid mold
formation, space heating or cooling during
[SPEAKER_01]: non-illuminated periods, and drying,
preheating of irrigation water,
[SPEAKER_01]: generation of carbon dioxide by burning
fossil fuel and ventilation and air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning to remove waste heat,
writes Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a well-researched argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did all that math and they haven't
figured out how much carbon dioxide the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant sucked back out that air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, but there's another side of that
coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on how many plants you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree with this article fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying there's like, there's a
little bit of subtraction that needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: done before we freak out a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: True that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She keeps on going and she says,
Uh-oh, where did I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor production also has environmental
consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been charged with deforestation and
high levels of water and pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as pot becomes more legal and
mainstream, notes Warren, outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: producers will have to abide by
pre-existing environmental laws just like
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: In effect, that makes indoor production
the chief climate change and energy
[SPEAKER_01]: concern, according to Warren's article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why she's proposing that all
states that legalize marijuana use should
[SPEAKER_01]: also require the growing industry to power
itself cleanly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not without precedent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting in October of this year,
Boulder County and Colorado will require
[SPEAKER_01]: many facilities to directly offset 100% of
electricity, propane, and natural gas
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption through renewables or other
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when they wrote that rule,
a bunch of people wigged out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Warren says she's not picking on the
marijuana industry with her proposals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, just that, well, we don't often
have new industries appear that use a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of energy and are likely to be highly
regulated as they become legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could actually be a marketing
tool for the industry, says Warren,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you have people who are
purchasing the product, who are the type
[SPEAKER_01]: of individual who cares about the
environment, then they would gravitate
[SPEAKER_01]: toward the green marijuana production.
[SPEAKER_01]: What she's saying makes sense because we
are sucking up a lot of power and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody can send me an email or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to do, uh, I consider
myself a pro grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could grow, you can give me a plant
that's half dead and in 90 days I'll give
[SPEAKER_01]: you some tasty ass buds out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can overcome those problems in a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want some guidance on how to lessen
my carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recycle my soil, uh, but still I have to
run lights for 12 hours on and 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other things we can do to kind
of lessen our carbon footprint?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys know, send me ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tweet them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want to see, I want to know how I
can save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an argument right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you would try to find those
cannabis cultivators would start looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for places like wine, you know,
places they would right next to rivers
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can have a water mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just talking about like my preexisting
indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people that have a home grow or a
small warehouse grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to find out ways that people
like us, like you, you've got a trap house
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a way that you can kind of
make a low, lessen your electricity bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just save you however much it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe cut 10% of that off.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could definitely do that with
solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're just cutting out the a hundred
dollars that it takes to run your house
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a hundred dollars less over a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would add up, you know, tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 15 to, you know, quite a bit of a
hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just watched you try to do math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, right now it's $1,200,
but I'm just saying like, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The local application of this is the city
of Pueblo just required everybody grow
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't grow outside in any fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully in a year we'll have greenhouse
rules done here, but they cut it all out
[SPEAKER_02]: and not until the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're talking about large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not even, not even a small person.
[SPEAKER_00]: My six persons in my own backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a city.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens if you're not on the
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pods legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for more illegal poggros
here now more than they were before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had legalized cannabis to tell you the
truth because now they want to regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit out of it before they didn't have
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one do we want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do the, which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're both good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to read the one written by,
they're both written by the same person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Kristen Wyatt actually is writing a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do the one about racism and
drop in Colorado pot arrests?
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read this one since I just teased
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens when you legalize pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get ready, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the legalization of marijuana in
Colorado hasn't solved the racial
[SPEAKER_01]: disparities and enforcement that drug
policy reformers had hoped to end with
[SPEAKER_01]: blacks still far more likely than whites
to be charged with pot related crimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: a new report says.
[SPEAKER_01]: The report issued Wednesday by the
Prolegalization Drug Policy Alliance
[SPEAKER_01]: showed that marijuana arrests in Colorado
all but stopped after voters made the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: legal in small amounts for those 21 and
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the report noted continuing racial
disparities involving the marijuana crimes
[SPEAKER_01]: that remain, including public use and
possession in excess of the ounce limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study examined drug arrests in all 64
Colorado counties for two years before and
[SPEAKER_01]: after legalization in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: The total number of charges for pot
possession, distribution, and cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: plummeted by almost 95% from about 39,000
in 2010 to just over 2,000 last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it only takes an hour of the cops time,
that's 37 cop hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: 37,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: 37,000 cop hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just reallocated to shit that's worth
them doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be out solving a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking for your bike that got stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking for something that bad happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to create crimes in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say it has been nice,
like not worrying about the bag that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It honestly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only crime most marijuana
consumers ever commit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only law I break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than like traffic infractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear my seatbelt and don't speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally the only problem is once
you pull me over, it's like, here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came from the dispensary.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I hope it smells good in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid a lot of money for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you can have my sweater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me five minutes and then when you
come back, tell me it smells like weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep reading because we
want to get through a couple of articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after legalization, blacks were more
likely, twice as likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blacks were more than... I stuttered
because we're saying blacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saying blacks still?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: African American would be the correct term
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It struck me as a little harsh when I read
it too, but I'm not a member of the PC
[SPEAKER_02]: squad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't write this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to complain that we're
calling African American people blacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you know you've made it when
you got those one or two guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, who are you calling blacks?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send an email to Kristen White at
the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did that, not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it slightly off putting to tell
you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after legalization, African American
folks were more than twice as likely as
[SPEAKER_01]: whites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's just oddly written.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell us community, is it us or in the
dabs or is it how it's written?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we the racist one or are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blacks were also more, much more likely to
be charged with illegal cultivation of pot
[SPEAKER_01]: or possession of more than an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization... I'm still off putting
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We legalized pot, we didn't legalize
decent policing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization is no panacea for the long
time issues that law enforcement had with
[SPEAKER_01]: the black and brown community,
said Art Way, Colorado director for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still the drop off in overall arrest is
good news for minorities, said Tony
[SPEAKER_01]: Newman, also of the Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite the uprising racial disparities,
the massive drops in arrests have been
[SPEAKER_01]: enormously beneficial to people of color,
Newman said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this racist?
[SPEAKER_02]: The more I think about it, the more I
think we stop referring to people by the
[SPEAKER_02]: general shade of their skin like fucking
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the term that I related to in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just based on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already passed you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the minority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're the minorities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well... All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The analysis did not break out data for
Colorado's largest ethnic minority,
[SPEAKER_01]: Latinos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because data comes from the
National Incident Based Reporting System,
[SPEAKER_01]: which does not tally numbers for Latinos.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the region's top officials for
coordinating drug enforcement,
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd Gorman of the Rocky Mountain High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program,
[SPEAKER_01]: insisted that officers are not racially
profiling pot users.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just calling them blacks and
whites.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a general assumption about a whole
race of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Racial disparities exist under laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean that... There's nothing
racist about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rape laws, weapon laws are racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other factors going on here that
we need to address, Gorman said.
[SPEAKER_01]: After legalization, racial disparities did
ease somewhat for marijuana distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blacks accounted for about 22% of such
arrests in 2010 and around 18% in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arrest data got a mixed response from
the regional head of the NAACP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the head of the NAACP know that you
were calling them blacks when you wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: this article?
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall decrease in arrests,
charges, and cases is enormously
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial to communities of color who
bore the brunt of marijuana prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosemary Harris Little said in a
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we are concerned with the rise in
a disparity for the charge of public
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption and challenge law enforcement
to ensure this reality is not
[SPEAKER_01]: discriminatory in any manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2014, the year Colorado's recreational
marijuana stores opened, blacks were 3.9%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the population but accounted for 9.2%
of pot possession arrests.
[SPEAKER_01]: For illegal marijuana cultivation,
disparities didn't just persist,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got much worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2010, whites in Colorado were slightly
more likely than blacks to be arrested for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: After legalization, the arrest rate for
whites dropped dramatically, but ticked up
[SPEAKER_01]: for blacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2014, the arrest rate for blacks was
roughly 2.5 times higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more of this article,
but I'm not going to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost done, but we get the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the way it's written,
and I just want to abandon it to tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of really good information
in it, but it seems like it was written
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really fast by somebody who wasn't
really thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to meet that deadline.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 60s, when they still called people
blacks and whites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that reporter, but yeah,
this strikes me as a little bit odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just like all of his work,
or is it just this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call her a
chick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rude, but it's a lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the AP reporter assigned to the
Colorado Marijuana stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink of this water,
and then we're going to read another
[SPEAKER_01]: article written by the same person,
and we're going to try to avenge her
death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this racist?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That felt really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just sounds so fucking rude to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did seem like something like if we were
in public, you wouldn't want to say it
[SPEAKER_02]: full-throated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to ask you, would you say
that out loud at the mall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all these blacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how she would state it in a
courtroom, or politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just be real, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no civil rights person, but I don't
even want to be called the whites over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the whites, and they're not the
blacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fucking people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose minority because I got long hair,
and that means you get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're still a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was trying to hit at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the moral of the story is pot's
almost legally for white here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of legally for black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the arrests are down a lot,
but it's still high for black people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay off of Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting there doing the math in my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's roughly 22,000 people of color that
didn't get arrested or fucked with last
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, the data is so screwed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to restructure most of how
we enforce the laws in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I want your opinion on that article
to people that are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me, email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that a racist article?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it oddly written in a racist tone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like the way that... Is it racist
to say it that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like it, so I abandoned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to read another article.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says, Colorado bill seeks to
standardize marijuana testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've noticed is a lot of people in
Colorado don't trust the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities anymore because we'll take a
test to one lab, and it'll come out at
[SPEAKER_01]: 22%, and you can take another test to
another lab, and it'll come out at 29%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, everyone's going to start going
to the lab that gets higher tests because
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be able to brag about higher
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real standard for the testing
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all just open our own lab pretty
much and be like, I got the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an email or a printed piece of
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a PDF on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to worry about if those high
dollar people couldn't pay more for better
[SPEAKER_00]: testing results.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is moving to establish another
marijuana first, the first government
[SPEAKER_01]: standards for marijuana testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bill approved by its first committee in
the state legislature on Thursday would
[SPEAKER_01]: create a statewide laboratory standard for
the state's 18 pot testing labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, the labs are certified by the
state health authorities, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have uniform rules for testing pot
potency, homogeneity, and contaminants as
[SPEAKER_01]: required by state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab owners say they need the standards
because different labs now produce very
[SPEAKER_01]: different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Existing pot tests generally just look for
whether the drug is present, not how
[SPEAKER_01]: strong it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most industries, there are long
established processes, said Ian Berenger,
[SPEAKER_01]: owner of a pot testing lab called RM3.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, for cannabis, like most of the
industry, we're making up the rules as we
[SPEAKER_01]: go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad he admits that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The labs can currently be used by licensed
marijuana producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bill was amended to remove lab access
to private individuals and industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, now covered in separate bills
still pending in the legislature,
[SPEAKER_01]: which kind of bars me from getting my
cannabis tested now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that I used to grow at my
private grow for my patients, I was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to take that to the lab and get it tested
and we could see what was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all need access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why they cut us off.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the latest step in a dance
that's been going on for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember we didn't have testing
labs because the existing labs that had
[SPEAKER_02]: the equipment and the know-how are banned
from working with cannabis because they
[SPEAKER_02]: all require FDA and federal licensure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to build these from the ground
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know there were 18 of them in the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says a separate bill advanced
Thursday and a Senate committee would
[SPEAKER_01]: allow industrial hemp growers to use the
labs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado currently allows farmers to grow
hemp, marijuana's non intoxicating cousin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but only if the plants fall below a
threshold for the plants intoxicating
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the farmers can take their plants
to a lab to make sure they're meeting the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The testing bill creates what's called a
reference library, a standard set of
[SPEAKER_01]: protocols for testing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab owner said the state needs to
essentially referee all the methodologies
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all understand the need to reveal the
special sauce we've been using to further
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry, Barringer said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bill now heads to a separate committee
before consideration by the full house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs to happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to- No, this is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the beautiful parts of
legalization is it's like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be regulated of all people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The testing labs for sure need to know
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all need to be using the same
equipment planned by the same rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start seeing reality in our
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spot bullshit on the shelf if
you're us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know your flower doesn't have 40% THC in
it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to even- You clearly
keep the- There's a local shop that's
[SPEAKER_01]: claiming, there's a local shop that claims
they have a 30% strain and I've seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know about that national strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the guy that was all hyped
up about this 29% apple pie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the apple pie strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both took one look at it and we both
look at him and we both looked at us and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like we tried not to giggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we all saw each other's poker face
right then, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows when you shit the bed and
you can spot it on the- That's a rough
[SPEAKER_01]: trait to have, just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these testing labs, if we get them
all standardized and regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we won't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like, this hash was tested super
clean and super high in potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, where'd you get it done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get it at the place that you pay a
lot more and they just give you really
[SPEAKER_01]: high results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle of the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or did you go to the place that's
reputable and if you got to test it at
[SPEAKER_01]: Steep Hill, I trust you, but I don't know
any of the other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steep Hill gave me a tour of their
facility and showed me what's going on and
[SPEAKER_01]: they blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other places, you just give them a
sample and they drive away and send you an
[SPEAKER_01]: email later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 100% cannabis too, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all they test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do your edibles and your labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying they're not another
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh yeah, we got science stuff in
here, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got science, bitch, we'll do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This gets more and more important because
we just required that all edible dosing be
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys remember how that first
regulatory check went through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was like episode six,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a long time ago we talked about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were edibles that were advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had 100 milligrams of THC and they
had zero at a peer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick a man for some fuck up last year,
but yeah, there were a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that couldn't make it and then
we had new rules that required that only
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 milligrams of THC are in each easily
identifiable segment, which meant no more
[SPEAKER_02]: 450 milligram fun-sized snickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Mountain Medicine bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those things are so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody showed me one the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie pulled one out of the fridge and
she's like, have you had these?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Mountain Medicine peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, I ate one on the podcast
and it almost floated out of the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fun night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of which, I want this
1,200-milligram challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the 2,500-milligram challenge?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, if you're going to do it,
you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants a half marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to Ralphie May,
let's do it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if that's the kind of night you
really want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys don't know about the
2,500-milligram challenge, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: check out episode 59.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be like 80 bucks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you got to work up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just want to drop down 2,500 at
one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they put it on that last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't really get done for a month,
but it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all lived, but we're still paying it
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something you got to work up to and I
don't know if you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the news articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about the growers meeting
that is coming up at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplies.

[SPEAKER_01]: It's Friday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three dudes on a Friday night recording a
podcast in my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, three dudes in my kitchen taking
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: With water.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Mike's got Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's living it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a root beer, but it's empty now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you had caffeine-free root beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't count as caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might as well be flavored water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's sugary water with bubbles in it
to take the dab mouth away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's the only one here living it
hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to close the show
because we're just getting ridonky.
