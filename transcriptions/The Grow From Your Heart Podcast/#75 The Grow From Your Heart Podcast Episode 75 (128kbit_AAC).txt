[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 75 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a hardcore dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rost and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting me use your music on
the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge thanks to Kat Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for joining me again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do another news episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting across the table from me is our
good news buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to share way too much right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got way too much information in this
opening story that I want to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overshare time, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a question to you and to
whoever else may be listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to drop down the music for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question to you guys, and I'm going
to, I shared a lot of my personal life on
[SPEAKER_01]: this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about my use of medicated
personal lubricants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about what CBD does to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys ever noticed that you can
take a dab or even flowers do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but dabs have definitely made it happen
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever smoked a certain strain and
it made you have to poop right away?
[SPEAKER_01]: You went silent on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just going to give the question
the thought that I would a rational
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have noticed that occasionally there
will be a certain strain that'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: around and I'll take a dab and almost
every time I dab it, I will get the urge
[SPEAKER_01]: to poop right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, I had a phenotype of Deadhead
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Deadhead OG number two was the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I smoked it, bro, I would get
like, oh, I'm needing to fart right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's specific cannabinoids that
have been found to really help with
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then it's probably got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could fully be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one it is, but you may
have stumbled into a strain that's high in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well something we dabbed tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to blame it on
because I was cool and then we took a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which dabs are you blaming this on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the change in the menu, the new
addition that we've been trying a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight is this headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I been dabbing the headband as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been dabbing the headband as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the weed then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit eating fucking black bean burgers,
you dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to blame the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listeners, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me, find me on Facebook,
do something, interact with me,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain strain that when you
smoke it makes you have to poop?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if this is just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet that at Ross Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it to the at GFYH podcast on Twitter or
find me on Facebook or you can send me an
[SPEAKER_01]: email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any ads for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sponsors this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: What month is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is June.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sponsors for the month of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to sponsor the show
starting in the month of July,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all the information that you
need to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to have your product featured on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a bunch of news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a news filled episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ready for some news y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my first news article is going to
be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a good way to kick down the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about taking a poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can just get right to the news
after that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dive right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a small sip of some
beverage here and get my throat nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: clear before we get into this news here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, say something useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't quite a fair back and forth
with me and Jeff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a laptop and a pile of notes and a
smartphone that's linked to the wifi and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have my memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to pass you this pile of hash
and a dabber and an email and then that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep the news and the show going and
you can just keep us nice and dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that beverage dislodged something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't even have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that it's in my control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw down this Durban poison or the
headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could dab either one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poison was so freaking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super high CBD sap stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm going to go with the Tora.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can reach this bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until after we get done with the main news
article for today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little sappier than what you're
used to, but you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got some AJ sour diesel and I
have got some.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, just more sour diesel and more
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can tell what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like these sativa dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Durban was quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the boys at Turpax.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up Turpax?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at Green and
Healthy Wellness Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Damsel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up John Randall Jr. Hope you're
doing well brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're playing some video games and
having a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey fellas, I saw the shop and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,
I recommend the spot dispensary in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: West.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in Colorado Springs and
you're looking for good flowers and or
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates, I definitely recommend that
you hit Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on 212 South Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure that's the address.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medical only shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot get in there without a medical
marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green and Healthy is medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spot is rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spot is recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can go to the spot if you're 21
and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody go to the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's paying me to say this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind bro, would you throw me
one of the Durban poisons?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us another day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a great headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best headlines I've gotten to
read on the show in a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: finally admits cannabis kills cancer
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great news because now that
they're admitting it, maybe we can start
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalizing it and using it as
medicine all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't jump to conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these are hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a man can dream, can't he?
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent you this and this was one of the
highlights in my week was reading this
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught the journal article that it talks
about a few months back, but I'm glad to
[SPEAKER_00]: see it start to make the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, that sound is parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: How large a dab would you like,
sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you eyeball out a 0.3 if I told you a
0.3?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I just saw why they call it
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the tip of the dabber will chip the
shatter in your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably say that's like 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice try.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably read the news article
I've teased you guys about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says a group of federal researchers
commissioned by the government to prove
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis has no accepted medical use
may have unwittingly let information slip
[SPEAKER_01]: through the cracks, revealing how cannabis
actually kills cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beautiful thing about how we
got here, just to step back for a second
[SPEAKER_00]: and do my obnoxious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great because I want to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you want it, so I grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis fanatics and supporters and
advocates don't get to do federal research
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds have blocked most research not
looking for harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the studies we have showing how safe
cannabis is and what an effective medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, most of those studies are studies
that will find out that it proves that it
[SPEAKER_00]: causes lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one of the top researchers spends a
couple of years looking at cannabis use
[SPEAKER_00]: and lung function and finds out that it
doesn't cause cancer, that it increases
[SPEAKER_00]: lung function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those fun things about
cannabis, and this is another great
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recovered from my dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice fill-in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the research which was conducted
by a team of scientists at St. George's
[SPEAKER_01]: University of London found that the two
most common cannabinoids in marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: tetrahydrocannabinol, which is THC,
and cannabidiol, which is our favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, weakened the ferocity of cancer cells
and made them more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation treatment, said Mike Adams of
Herbal Dispatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main two cannabinoids in marijuana,
they say marijuana a lot in this article,
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis, weaken the ferocity of cancer
cells and make them more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is kicking cancer's ass,
is what it's saying right there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Making it more obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it's saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making it its bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the first research study to
find exactly that, that something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plant, likely THC or CBD,
is triggering what they call apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when a cell in your body is
supposed to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apoptosis happens and the cell dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's replaced by a new cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer, the cell doesn't die and grows out
of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis triggers the cell, tells it it's
time to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second federal medical marijuana
patient ever has been shouting this from
[SPEAKER_00]: the rooftops for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Irv?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Irv.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Irv.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irvin Rosenfeld, everybody, if you haven't
heard that name before, Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read his book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His story will blow your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read more books, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets to smoke joints at a special room
in Disneyland, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the US federal government to court
and said, cannabis is the best medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you, tell me otherwise, and won in
federal court and can smoke joints
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, on the road, at work,
across from the DEA headquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the DEA headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a stockbroker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere you're allowed to consume
tobacco, he's allowed to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds ship him 11 ounces a month for
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: For free?
[SPEAKER_01]: For free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that Irv and you couldn't pay me
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 11 ounces a month for free,
it's exactly what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kept him alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be dead without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the world record holder for most
joints smoked in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Snoop, but Irv's record's
confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets the gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snoop's probably smoked the most blunts
and also post the most Instagram posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an award Snoop can win,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read more of this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, The study, which was published
last year in the medical journal,
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular Cancer Therapies, details the
dramatic reductions in fatal variations of
[SPEAKER_01]: brain cancer when these specific
cannabinoids were used in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't try it without radiation,
but it said it helped with radiation in
[SPEAKER_01]: conjunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So marijuana can kill certain cancer
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've shown that cannabinoids could play a
role in treating one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive cancers in adults, wrote lead
researcher, Dr. Wei Li, I hope I said that
[SPEAKER_01]: right, I apologize, in a November 2014
op-ed for the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: The results are promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could provide a way of breaking through
Guilloma tumors and saving more lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's a little sub headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, The NIDA report said,
The evidence from one animal study
[SPEAKER_01]: suggests that extracts from whole plant
marijuana can shrink one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: serious types of brain tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research in mice showed that these
extracts, when used with radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: increased the cancer killing effects of
the radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes on to say, NIDA's new found
pro-pot position is especially curious
[SPEAKER_01]: given that it was revealed on the heels of
a recent proposal introduced to both
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress and the House of Representative,
which attempts to legalize medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana on a national level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bill, which is called the Careers Act,
seeks to downgrade the schedule one status
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana to a schedule two in order to
make the herb more flexible in the eyes of
[SPEAKER_01]: the federal government as an acceptable
form of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the bill would also remove
cannabidiol, the non-intoxicating compound
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pot plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody finally said compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't call it a fucking ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see somebody finally get that
one right.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they heard the podcast,
if somebody heard me call them out,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I used the word compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, they should say compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they are removing cannabidiol,
the non-intoxicating compound of the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, from the Controlled Substances Act
to allow it to be distributed on a
[SPEAKER_01]: state-to-state basis without violating
federal statutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis became a schedule one drug in
1970 with the passing of the Controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: Substances Act, which classified cannabis
as having a high potential for abuse,
[SPEAKER_01]: no medical usage, and unsafe to use
without medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_01]: This federal research basically
contradicts cannabis' schedule one status.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could this mean reform is closer than we'd
originally imagined?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, is this the floodgate right here
for cannabis reform now that we have found
[SPEAKER_01]: out that it actually does kill cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that with absolutely no doubt,
because the federal government holds a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent for cannabis as a neuroprotective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I was headed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal medical marijuana program is
as old as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 32, 33 years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've known a lot of this for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want to admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if they do admit it, do you think
that that's going to open the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical company floodgates to where
they want to make and patent cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as soon as it tips federally
legal, the pharma industry, the tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, everybody's going to try to jump
in it if they can or if they have a desire
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still that big, it's immoral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think any of the... If you put
big and then capitalize the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, I don't think they're going to
care.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tobacco industry is not moral.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing you anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they've got one more product,
they can sell you because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to lose cigarette smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to do right after we get
stoned?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you want to do is fuck and
smoke a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they'll have two products to sell
you and you're going to be buying them all
[SPEAKER_01]: day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think that... Who is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Philip Morris and R.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reynolds are those cigarette companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: The two rings of bell in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you pulled two correct names there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think those guys... The alpha brain,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to attribute that to alpha
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think... Attribute that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: To advertising, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think those guys are lined up?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like fucking... Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at the football team at the
scrimmage line ready to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as someone says hike, they're
going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definite evidence that different
tobacco companies are definitely looking
[SPEAKER_00]: into marijuana legalization and have been
since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we got really close in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody seems to remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jimmy Carver almost was the president
who legalized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed up late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there for that either,
but it's part of the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, where the fuck were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dabbed out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I saw you look at your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You looked at your fingernails like,
I'm not sure what I'm saying right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they have found out that cannabis
will kill cancer cells and we're worried
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's going to go to the
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big tobacco is going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, the tobacco companies have been
looking at it into the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the fuck I was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some serious problems with... A
lot of people just assume, oh well,
[SPEAKER_00]: all Marlboro has to do is plant huge
fields of sour diesel and then they can
[SPEAKER_00]: put out cartons of Marlboro's just now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, it doesn't grow like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, it doesn't dry like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: C, it doesn't cure like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: D, it doesn't roll through the same
machines as tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would literally have to build the
whole infrastructure up from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't just convert their existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that hurdle for everybody on
top of which Colorado Dixie elixirs is
[SPEAKER_00]: already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that infrastructure is already built.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, Marlboro has to catch up
to Dixie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some pharma companies in Great
Britain that are light years ahead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the industry, but that's because
Great Britain has much better research
[SPEAKER_00]: rules than we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, I used to see on
Facebook and shit, I used to see pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: of Marlboro having weed packages already
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that real do you think, or is that
with just some stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a Photoshop mockup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a company out of Colorado that
was attempting to put together a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes filled with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they were to the marketing to
dispensary stage the last time I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they were to go fund me
stage and the guy was over pitching it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the restaurant or what, but I've heard
they're on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to shops enough to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I do go to a shop often because I
work in one, but I don't pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see any green and healthy
wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump out of this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up to cannabinoids and fuck you
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I want to wrap up that article.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another article.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from The Cannabis and of
course it is written by our good friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article kind of sparked some
controversy and we'll get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: controversy right after.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is, is this central Denver's
first 420 friendly hotel sub headline is
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke, vape and edibles on the balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good at native hotel Denver's
downtown Denver's first outwardly 420
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says many in Colorado's bustling
cannabis industry have complained about
[SPEAKER_01]: the lack of marijuana friendly hotels in
this state and others, but it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can buy cannabis on every corner in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you drive down federal,
if you drive down Broadway, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go down Colorado Boulevard,
it's, I mean, in some areas it's more than
[SPEAKER_00]: every corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shout out green mile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little, little, uh, broadster damn there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a Starbucks and then a car
dealership and then a fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what else is there up there in
Denver?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little art studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little art studio or something,
but yeah, it's all about a tattoo shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, was what was on my brain at
fucking tattoo store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are all these places to buy
cannabis, but the only place to smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: legally is at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just drove from Texas,
you ain't got no home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And imagine having, you just drove how
many hours from Texas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mind's blown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get out to the parking lot and you're
not going to wait 10 to 14 hours to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive home and smoke that first Colorado
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different special crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go, you've got to find
accommodations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, how many Airbnb places are in
Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're, you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a place to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big, this is a need that needs
filling people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, uh, the next line here says,
but Keith Cole, a partner, Richmond Meyer
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually doing something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's opening native hotel this week in
downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boasting that half of its 16 rooms have
weed friendly balconies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it right, every hotel has a weed
friendly balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my issue with the balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're a tourist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick you on the balcony
and give you crazy good weed at altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're setting you up for a dive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different ways can we set
ourselves up for failure in this industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: We like, we can't bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're incredibly popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buildings full of weed and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what jackass with a big gun and a
tiny Dick doesn't want a big building full
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed and money to rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still somehow like the robbery rates
lower than seven 11s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen the security guards at the
spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: True, but they ain't there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a, I saw Mark Emery's post
from yesterday on Facebook, one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: friend's dispensaries in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody drove a truck through the front
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apprehended the guy in a different
dispensary doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second time in a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a fun place Vancouver must
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but I mean, how many different ways
we can, can we set ourselves up for
[SPEAKER_00]: failure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the last thing you want is a newbie
from Texas on Edibles on a balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: My high ass on a balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to drop the pipe right off that
son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heads up mothership coming down for a
landing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year we were at a hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say the name of the
hotel, but it's a popular hotel in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a dab or go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had all the rooms full in one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this whole hallway was all dab kids
from the cannabis industry and upstairs
[SPEAKER_01]: was all dab kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody was like, Hey bro,
you got any butane?
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one guy up above goes, I got a can
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy goes, drop it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody got quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see two arms go over the balcony and
he goes scoot over and the guy scooted
[SPEAKER_01]: over and he dropped the can of butane and
that shit landed right in the dude below
[SPEAKER_01]: him's hand, below his hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a random bout,
but most of these Texas stoners or
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebraska stoners that just took their
first dab in a hotel are not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to catch or deal with the balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ground level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking, they don't even need stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the need for consumption clubs and
cannabis friendly hotel accommodations is
[SPEAKER_00]: massive here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to jump out of the article
and just kind of rant on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I was headed with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have a, and I'm not trying to
bash on the hotel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sound like I'm snitching on the hotel
and talking shit, but why can we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis friendly hotel, but we cannot,
you're fighting with that mic dab rig,
[SPEAKER_01]: email combo so hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to burn my face so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have this hotel, but we cannot
have the smokers clubs that were in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: POTUS got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: POTUS was where everybody used to be able
to go and dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another speakeasy that I
recently went to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spoke of, they recently got told that
they couldn't smoke in there anymore or
[SPEAKER_01]: they would be dealt with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grassroots break room got shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the smoking clubs, Mike's
telling me to kill his mic because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cough it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it got the echo reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these smoking clubs have been shut
down, but we can have a hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has given me a thumbs up that I could
put his mic back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recover dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see the size dab mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size dab mic takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dabs for ants and he chokes like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys quit smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get healthy, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run some laps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spit that shit out and get off the
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting too old for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some reasons to live now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while some downtown Denver hotels
quietly allow marijuana friendly tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: tour operators to book vape friendly
rooms, native will be central Denver's
[SPEAKER_01]: first outwardly friendly hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The charm of native hotel is that the
owners are in the business, said Meyer,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is an owner, partner, and investor in
a number of cannabis related ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they got a sick answer on the
question with we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my other business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way better answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you what else I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a hotel right over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, so we could pretty much just go rent
the hotel for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay for the whole night and
shit, but then it'd just be a spot to go
[SPEAKER_01]: chill and dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive unless you're doing all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a ballroom?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they got plenty of ballroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We embrace the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We embrace the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We embrace the plant and everything that's
coming along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A native hotel opening in the former jet
hotel space at 1612 Wazee Street in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver's Lodo neighborhood will hardly be
a weed free for all, but half of its rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: will have cannabis friendly balconies.
[SPEAKER_01]: No smoking inside, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's Canbria Cafe will serve coffee
infused with imported cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have your terpenes and your CBD and
it's getting infused in 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: dosages into four of our coffees,
said Meyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My partner has concocted different elixirs
for different situations like hangover
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that hemp juice they sell on
the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, since it's CBD, they can sell it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it's not THC, it qualifies as hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how they're getting away with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to grow hemp in most
industrialized nations and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezing CBD out of it since it hit
Sanjay Gupta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was going to complain that
didn't Senate Bill 1084 shut down the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to serve a medicated concoction on
your premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they found a way around it,
dude, by... It's not really medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hemp seed juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Meyer, who owns the 420 Friendly Hotel
and is a partner at Keef Cola,
[SPEAKER_01]: also plays a role in licensing company
Cancore Concepts, extraction equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer Isolate Extraction Systems,
hemp company Native Hemp Corp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the American Trade Association for
Cannabis and Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of Meyer's many industrial
hats, native will still feel like a
[SPEAKER_01]: standard high-end boutique hotel,
he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I didn't hear listed there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabis shop or a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the many, many entrepreneurs
that have sprung up just outside to help
[SPEAKER_00]: support our wonderful industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a reason to protect that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Sam won't take your shit for working
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take it if you are us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want your tax money like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people in my life that have lobbied
me to be him rather than to be me,
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty soon, Mike is going to teach you
guys how to become a lobbyist or how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get in the ground floor of doing medical
marijuana activism or recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis activism or cannabis legalization
activism, whatever you're into,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is going to do a little lesson on how
to get into that pretty soon for us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably two or three episodes away from
that, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get involved, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys seem intimidated, but it's not
that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's got this hotel and you can
smoke there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes on to say, we're not going to
be hanging green crosses everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: added Meyer, who said he funded native
with money he made in the financial
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there's this big cannabis
tourism movement and we want to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: embrace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have cannabis friendly rooms because
they have balconies.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just out of curiosity, do you remember the
number of people that came in for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more than 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this thing works, we need about
3,500 other people to do the same thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Lodo.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, all over Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, just for the cannabis cup,
like, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need one out in Pueblo West right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a cannabis Marriott.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hotel in Manitou Springs that
claims to be 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a 420 friendly on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the first one in Denver is the
only reason it's really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in Manitou, it's not, you can't
smoke in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a smoking tent and then they
have a sub smoking tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have the cigarette tent and then
right next to it is the cannabis tent with
[SPEAKER_01]: like chairs and shit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is 420 friendly in there,
but you can't smoke out and dab out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to lay in the bed and watch
cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked weed in plenty of hotel
parking lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this one special?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Meyer said he's been kicked out of
hotels in Denver for smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of his room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other hotels will find you crazy amounts
and kick you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I've been kicked out at a hotel
in Denver for smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a mid tier smaller hotel and it was
a few years back, but that's the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I don't want to happen in our hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meyer said he's working on some affinity
partnerships with local recreational pot
[SPEAKER_01]: shops and other related businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show your native hotel room key and get a
discount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says pro tip, recreational shop,
Loto wellness is right across the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for stocking his rooms, many bars with
branded rolling papers, glass pipes and
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff in his team aren't quite there
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Accoutrements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good word to learn now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to double and triple check
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not putting our business at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meyer said it's a hotel, a club and a
restaurant, and we have a lot of alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: related point of sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're keeping the cannabis to the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a big thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to keep the cannabis
and the alcohol separate because the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed to let you gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really bizarre part of the law
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most places don't allow any sort of
gathering to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get all kinds of touchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be private, invite only,
private property, close to the public,
[SPEAKER_00]: secured security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the shit the symphony had to go
through just so the people could get baked
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go listen to the symphony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they tried to shut that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really set the path for the rules for
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to go, Colorado Symphony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who thought they were going to be the
trailblazer, but they stepped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enough news, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thanks for coming and doing another
new show with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start putting together your little episode
about how to get these people into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are a few people that are
out there listening right now that want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a cannabis activist and they don't know
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start writing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me like 15 or 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you heard him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just gave us his word, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to do that for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to start thinking about what you can
do for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this show is going to come out on a
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be back on Monday with another
episode coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it'll be the next
episode, but coming up pretty soon,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will do an episode about phenohunting
and mother plants, how to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: your mother plants, how to select a good
mother plant from the phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've done a little bit of it,
but I'm going to do a nice focused episode
[SPEAKER_01]: on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's going to do his show about getting
us into politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's getting involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it'll be called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much getting you into politics
or getting you into lobbying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you got to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get involved now,
we're going to be stuck in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: dimerish loop forever, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to make stupid rules around
us that we didn't even pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: them making, and they're going to pass it
because nobody knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your whole country is going to be
stuck with fucking CBD only medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: because we weren't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big anti-poly groups going
around the country right now is now
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying for CBD only nationally,
because if that rule goes in federally,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get their perfect excuse for stamping
out all of the medical access we've
[SPEAKER_00]: created since 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to say, again, well, the feds are
allowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else gets to have it except through
A, B, and C, and they get to shut down
[SPEAKER_00]: everything coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the excuse they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it once already in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that on a future,
on the episode when you tell us how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get involved, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, I'll be back Monday with another
full on episode, probably something more
[SPEAKER_01]: in depth, more less newsy, probably be
just myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get King Kola and
maybe Jesse back over for some more shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those boys are busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's outdoor season, so Jesse is kicking
it with the outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be back on the podcast sometime
after Christmas, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get them over here and do some
outdoor growing episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean agreed to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company is going
to maybe jump back on sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not the Rocky Mountain Worm Company,
it will be Rocky Mountain Organic Farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Sean's company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will come do a lot of speaking once he
becomes an official sponsor of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for listening again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in sponsoring the
podcast or if you have a product you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like me to review, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all the information you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I would have a lot of fun sitting
here testing out whatever product you sent
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some stuff to product test,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that nail we were checking out
that a friend of ours had?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the torchless?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was called the torchless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to review one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim, if you're listening to the show,
bro, sometimes you listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like you to send me a torchless
nail to review on the show and we will
[SPEAKER_01]: review it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Torchless nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then maybe you can become a sponsor or
something and that's how we'll pay for the
[SPEAKER_01]: nail if we like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't like it, we'll send it right
back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else do we need as a sponsor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Pella Nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys that make the cases with the
e-nail built into the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we need those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to test out one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabidoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dabidoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the Dabidoo is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another electronic nail company I've been
seeing online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good social media stuff from them
or stuff that's got my eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is reached by over 10,000 people
on every episode within the first 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: of being posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some local glass blowers
that could use a little prop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, if you want to
sponsor the show, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to be advertised on a
podcast that reaches 10,000 pot smokers
[SPEAKER_01]: within 24 hours, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the show is over, guys,
make sure you go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search for a girl from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a five-star rating, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jedi mind tricking you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so after you give me five
stars, type in a little comment and let me
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you think of the show,
and I will read your comment on a future
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to read it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read every comment that's on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stitcher completely sucks for comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's hard to leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They change Stitcher constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can leave a comment on there,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always leave some comments on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can leave little comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only get 140 characters, but you can
hit me up on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have something to say, but you're
not into the social media thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that every show is available
on iTunes, Stitcher, and all the episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: are forever archived on

[SPEAKER_00]: Or send some news to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike will proofread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of questions.
