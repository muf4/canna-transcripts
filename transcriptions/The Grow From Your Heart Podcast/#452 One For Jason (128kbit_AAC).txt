[SPEAKER_00]: All right, take 17 or somewhere around
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 452 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is dedicated to
the life and memory of my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason was battling cancer for a really
long time and I got the news that
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately last night he has lost his
battle with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of great things written down
that I want to talk about and things I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say about my friend, but I'm not
sure how much of that I can get through
[SPEAKER_00]: here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please bear with me and join me while
we honor my friend, Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is a tradition that we start this
podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Jason was super important to
everybody at the Green Dot Labs team.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was what my friend just called a,
what did he call them, a coal in the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: for Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you needed a motivator, if you needed
somebody to cheer you up and get you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking started, Jason was the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I got myself some Green Dot Labs
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have gone a little bit overboard,
if Green Dot has it available right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am probably smoking some of it in honor
of our boy Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big fucking stupid size, ridiculous
Green Dot dabs for our buddy Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start this
dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking Green Dot for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're catching the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blowing your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what we're dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a couple of years older than me and
I call him a kid because he was a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: kid at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew how to do business, he knew how to
take care of shit, but he wasn't burdened
[SPEAKER_00]: by adulthood.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't let all that business shit,
he didn't let all the work stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't slow him down, it didn't make a
smile go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was gonna make sure that we had a
positive attitude, that we had fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody had what they needed,
the work got done, and then everybody got
[SPEAKER_00]: a hug and a high five at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was a great fucking kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though he was older than me,
he was a good fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I've mentioned about Jay is
positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude, you never see him, there are so
many pictures of him on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that is a testament
of how awesome this kid was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at all of the pictures on
Facebook, and everybody today has posted
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 pictures of this guy, everybody's got
photos of him, every picture, he has got a
[SPEAKER_00]: smile from ear to ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude doesn't stop smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He beams love, he beams kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grown adult, sometimes we need advice
from friends, and sometimes you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shy on who you're gonna ask advice from
from friends because most of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the same industry as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry can be competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends, including myself,
have big fucking man egos, and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: wanna ask other men for advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never felt shy or ashamed to just ask
Jay for some guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey bro, here's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would Jason do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd be like, bro, I would fucking
quit being a pussy, and I would do it like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and he'd be like, you're right,
I knew that that's what somebody needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: say to me, I just needed you to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would motivate you, he would be
positive with you, he would give you
[SPEAKER_00]: advice, he was filled with kindness,
and even if you didn't see him for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, we lived quite a ways away from
each other, no excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we wouldn't see each other for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did see each other, it was one of
those, you know, you do the handshake,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a handshake, it's a fist bump,
and then it turns into a man hug,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you back up, and you kind of high
five, and you just talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that, the moment we saw each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: His friendship was everlasting,
his friendship was unconditional,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that unconditional love, that
unconditional friendship shows through his
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody on social media is posting about
how much they love this guy, about how
[SPEAKER_00]: much he helped them, everybody's got a
story about how Jay helped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he got sick, everybody did their
best to help him, and we've all
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to auctions, and given
donations and things to help our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an amazing friend, he was a great
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just, he was a cool kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fucking showed up with his oversized
grassroots hat, and he was always fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stylish, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the coolest clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't dress all stylish like that,
but that kid dresses in mad fucking style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always had the coolest hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just always positive, just cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always beamed this cool energy,
this cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just love and kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strangers would walk up to him and be
like, hey, you've got cool vibes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to share his vibe,
share his love, make sure we continue his
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit, continue his energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to express my love for the dude
here on a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I wanted to take this as a time to
say thank you to my friend Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say thank you face to face
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have many things to thank him for,
just basically for the friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first thing I would thank him
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had business talks, we had friend
talks, we had relationship talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all kinds of fun conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe him a big thank you for all the
inspiration, the advice, and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship, and I wish I would have told
him in person several many more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had the opportunity to smoke a
dab with that dude right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would love all these concentrates I got
on my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would tell me which one I had to smoke
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna miss my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire cannabis community is at a
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody feels it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social media is in tears today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody misses you, Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wish you were all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't have a smooth segue into the
next portion of my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no smooth segue out of that
last part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to tell you what I want
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brought me to thinking that medical
patients are basically pioneers and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Jason was very well spoken for
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been involved in medical cannabis
since I knew him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a huge part of the Colorado
cannabis medical and recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a big part of the concentrate
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found that a lot of the people who
are using cannabis for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take one dab and you can find
great relief where before you may have had
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke two or three bowls to get the
same relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our boy Jay was a medical patient and I
believe he was partially a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been making concentrates in Colorado
since we were just coming, since the
[SPEAKER_00]: market was getting huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has earned that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by being such a good dude,
having such a good heart, being so
[SPEAKER_00]: outgoing, he also became a community
leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the Colorado cannabis
community knows who Jason is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like every state that has
legalized or will legalize medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will have a person like Jason in
their area, in their demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to have that like
outgoing, charismatic, super friendly,
[SPEAKER_00]: business minded, family oriented,
kind of a business person who is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient and an activist and an advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times those are the people
who help us get the medical marijuana laws
[SPEAKER_00]: started and get things put in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who stand up for us at
city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the people who do their best to
hold the city and counties accountable
[SPEAKER_00]: when things go wrong and the rules and
regulations are backfired and citizens'
[SPEAKER_00]: rights and patients' rights are infringed
upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people who do that type of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are crucial to our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are critical for our cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without those people helping create the
rules, without the people doing all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: petitioning, without the people doing all
the city council work, the growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensaries, the trimmers,
all of that stuff is useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those people are critical to our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason many of those people are
fighting so strongly to legalize medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and to uphold the rules and
regulations that medical cannabis gives
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, those rights that we are
afforded by those laws, the reason they
[SPEAKER_00]: fight so strongly is because cannabis is
what they have found to help keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: alive or comfortable or to improve the
quality of their lives in a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why they are out there
fighting to legalize cannabis and to
[SPEAKER_00]: uphold patient rights because they are
patients themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know firsthand how well cannabis
works to cure ailments in their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what their ailments are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as cannabis is making it better,
we should allow them to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why many people become
activists, become advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to heal themselves and they want
to see that healing and that improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: in life amongst other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many cannabis advocates and activists
are pioneers in their area is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because those people have
passion and a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are passionate about medical cannabis
because it is improving the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their daily life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't have as much pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they are able to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it makes the PTSD go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it makes the seizures stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are improving the quality of their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that passion comes purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not legal, but it makes my
ailments go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do everything I can to make
cannabis available to myself and other
[SPEAKER_00]: people with this ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you have added some purpose to
that passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got passion and you have got
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on the right track to actually do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes somebody do something
real, passion and purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, ladies and gentlemen, my advice to you
is find your passion and find your purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: because your time is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love to do and figure out how
doing what you love to do can be a purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you contributing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out a way to make your passion
contribute positively to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't worry about money,
you will make your income.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will pay your rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not starve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not be homeless if you follow
your passion and your purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is one more important lesson
that I've learned today.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do find your passion and your
purpose, no matter how committed and how
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated you are, take a couple of
minutes to tell a couple of your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that you love them and that you're
grateful that they're there because at any
[SPEAKER_00]: minute they may not be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, find your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, make a few minutes out of every
day to love the people who are important
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up
this quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for a short episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some grieving to do on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to turn off this microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs for
our boy, Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sit here in the quiet by
myself and just think about my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: think about things I'm grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with a full length
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
Thank you.
