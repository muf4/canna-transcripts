[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 751 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to focus on a
couple of grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a few shout outs to a few of the
great folks who continue to support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: the show when you would like to learn how
to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of supporting the show,
I want to start by saying thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who sent me feedback and
constructive criticism on the last episode
[SPEAKER_00]: I previously asked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like and dislike about the
show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see more solo shows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see more guests?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great feedback,
a lot of great responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps me to make a quality show
that you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know what you enjoy, the number one
response and request that I did get from
[SPEAKER_00]: that feedback was longer podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to give you longer podcasts,
but just being me sitting here rambling at
[SPEAKER_00]: a camera with a few notes in front of me,
it feels real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really weird going for longer than 25,
35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to talk to yourself for that
long without somebody at least nodding at
[SPEAKER_00]: you and replying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this camera looking at me,
but it gets weird after about 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm just talking at the wall
because I'm just talking to a camera lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give me any feedback,
which is hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gotten good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Instagram lives definitely help on the
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get the comments and some feedback in
there, but that does help me get going
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's I'm just talking at the wall,
so it's hard to carry on a 30 minute
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also my voice will burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get a time to let my throat cool
down, my voice cool, my moisten,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any rest while the other
person talks because it's just me talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to do more than 30 minutes or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The voice burns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also the ADD burns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start thinking about like, well,
now I have to edit this long ass show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get the show up to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing that you guys probably
don't care about is when I do the
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-cam shows and they get real long,
they take a long time to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that stuff does come to mind when I'm
making longer shows, but mainly it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because I just can't talk for 30 minutes
by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other request was that I do bring Mike
on more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do seem to enjoy having Mike on the
podcast, which does of course result in
[SPEAKER_00]: longer shows because Mike can talk quite a
bit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future, you will see some shows
with Mike via the general survey says that
[SPEAKER_00]: they do want Mike on about a third of the
shows, maybe a quarter, maybe a fifth of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in that area, but not every
show, but they do want to hear from Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get Mike on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, this is an official invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a babysitter, come be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main point of that start of the show
there was thank you, you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great constructive criticism,
the positive feedback, steering me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we all do need a little bit of
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't ask you what I'm doing
right and wrong, you might not tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll never figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next order of business on the list of
things to cover is something I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have teased or hinted about this
previously, but I redirect is live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you check out my website, iregenetics
.com on the top and the middle row of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you can select the options is what
those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one that says I redirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what that gets you to that takes you
right to I redirect where you can get some
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics direct from the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That menu will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often things will be updated frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will sell out and not get
updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will be restocked frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just got to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you were on the discord,
the discord occasionally will notify you
[SPEAKER_00]: when I do some updates and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will of course be a link to the
discord in the show notes and the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a link to the ire direct
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need that, of course you can find
it iregenetics.com, but the discord will
[SPEAKER_00]: give you the updates when there are new
drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a good way to stay updated on the new
drops is to join the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the website iregenetics
.com, there is an opportunity to join the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply type in your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send out a newsletter approximately
once a month, maybe every other month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to spam you too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't have a lot to talk about,
I'm going to give out coupons very soon
[SPEAKER_00]: for the ire direct website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon will get coupons, the discord will
get coupons, the newsletter will get
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do of course join the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also of course join the patreon and of
course do join us on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more very important order of
business to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at the Dude Grows Cup Saturday,
July 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event starts at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party ends at 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just outside of Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far I think White Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have somebody else there with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to make any plans or
announcements or promises yet until we get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we will have a great team
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cool members of the ire army will
be showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are traveling from all
over the country, possibly all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, to come hang out with us at the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do please join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is once again July 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event does start at 2 p.m.

[SPEAKER_00]: dudegrows.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get you tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get you laced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis tasting event,
a cannabis competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that shows up will be given a
fresh one hitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be given a lighter and then they
will be allowed to sample all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entries that have entered the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of your favorite seed breeders
will be there vending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have a lot of great things prepared
for the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I have one more very,
very important message that we do have to
[SPEAKER_00]: read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be the most important message
in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon and it goes a
lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, thanks for addressing
my question on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to change my methods for
the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it says, I appreciate you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a completely unrelated note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it you that I heard about frying a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich like a
[SPEAKER_00]: grilled cheese?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one last night and it was unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I heard about it from you
a while back, but I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that tip was you, then big ups once
again, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That definitely was from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk about in the 7-11 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number 7-11 was all about the
munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys got the joke that I did
there, 7-11 and the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode talking about snacks and
munchies and I did mention a fried or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a grilled peanut butter and jelly
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make yourself a normal peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slap butter on the outsides of both pieces
of the bread and throw that fucker in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grill it like you would a grilled cheese
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that peanut butter and that jelly make
this melty, schmelty, gooey, warm texture
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor in the middle that is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to our friends here for
following the guidance, following the
[SPEAKER_00]: advice, experiencing life and enjoying the
grilled or the fried peanut butter and
[SPEAKER_00]: jelly sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found out about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reporting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I had some grow questions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a grow question that came from
the website, from the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says, keep me anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend anonymous
and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff, when you switch to
18-6 at the end of the flowering cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you reduce the intensity of the lights
or just let them rip?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about their DLI needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do reduce the power, okay,
I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't even need to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of recap what our friend is
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been preaching a method,
a technique of I switch my lights back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 hours on and six hours off at the end
of a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people think that that is absolutely
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think I'm fucking everything up by
doing this, but it has proven to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: successful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned this by doing it to my seeded
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that my seeds become more
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They harden up faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bigger, stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faster, more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a better germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more successful seeds from a crop by
switching my flowering lights to 18 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: on and six hours off toward the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing this with the flowering
crop that is not seeded, I generally do
[SPEAKER_00]: this when I begin to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final 10 to 14 days or so is when I
will do the 18 hours on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One note that I have been stressing that
people make sure to follow this word of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please listen to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do the 18-6,
do not do it on the first run with a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how long that plant takes to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know when to change the timer to
18-6 next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let the plants finish the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do this on a brand new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a first date trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trick for a plant that you've
got some experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of flower, during the flush
phase, I will turn my lights back on from
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 to 18 hours on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm giving them half a day more worth
of light, more worth of photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: more energy for growth, more robust,
fat, dense buds is basically what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get, or in my case, bigger,
fatter, healthier seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do just straight turn the light timer
on to 18-6 and I do not change the
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of the lighting at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to reduce the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give them more light,
longer days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are going to say your plants
are going to revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes much longer for the plants to
revege than it does for them to beef up
[SPEAKER_00]: and swell in time for the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I talk about don't do this on
your first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do this on the second and third
run, we know when the harvest will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kick it right in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut down before anybody reveges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is no, I do not reduce
the amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I switched 18-6, I keep them banging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them going and I do it business as
usual until the plants are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me know to keep you
anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have another message right
here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go by J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send me a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't read them all on the show,
but I do read them all on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't reply to every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do keep sending me your great
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a smart person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some great ideas, but you should
go outside and get away from the computer
[SPEAKER_00]: for just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up, Ross, to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your personal order of importance
in your grow operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would this change at home versus
commercially?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he kind of touches it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is there an order in which you
enter and exit your grow areas to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing issues from one area to another,
like an order of workflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it follows up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your mother room have a special
entrance or exit or plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any special procedures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's some more stuff that we don't
really need to cover a lot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can jump right into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of the question,
is there an order of importance in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, would it change at home
versus commercially?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can answer that very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow versus a commercial
grow, the order of operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of operations change
drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we've got a
lot of people going in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least three to five,
maybe 10, maybe 20 people going in and out
[SPEAKER_00]: of any commercial environment at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our regular employees, you've got
your lead cultivator, then you got your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tax, and then you got your helpers,
and then you got your trim crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: your lead trimmer, your harvest manager,
your compliance manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people running through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also sometimes ownership shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owners aren't employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a shit about standard
operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you could tell the owner,
we do it this way, and they go,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, but we all put on Tyvex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all wear suits and fucking tie up our
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner goes, I'm going to wear my dress
and my high heels in there, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: give a fuck what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of people coming and going
through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have contractors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume, just because that's what my
brain works, I assume that those
[SPEAKER_00]: contractors came from another grow before
they worked in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what my brain thinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody that shows up in a
commercial facility just came from another
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not real, but that's what my
brain thinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of people coming and going
is my point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say control, but I can
control the coming and going of some
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control the procedures of some
people, the cleanliness, the approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people, I cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ownership, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a paid consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend things to the owner,
but I cannot tell the owner what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fire employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hire employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner can fire me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend that you don't wear the
high heels and the skirt into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room that you put on the Tyvek suit like
the rest of us, but if she wants to look
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, that's what she is going to fucking
do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order of importance definitely does
change in a personal grow compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we've got so many people
coming in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's so much more at stake in a
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my personal grow fails, I will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't make a crop of seeds or I won't
make a batch of flowers and Mike won't get
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke and we won't have as good of a
time, but life will go on, shit will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ruin a crop at a commercial grow
because we let somebody bring in some bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: or I brought in some bugs or there was a
mistake, there are millions of dollars at
[SPEAKER_00]: risk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One crop, one major crop failure in the
commercial market right now could destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that commercial grow were to fail,
it could also destroy their medically
[SPEAKER_00]: infused product facility, which would be
... So the grow is where the flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers aren't sold from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are then taken either directly to the
dispensary for sale, which is my next
[SPEAKER_00]: avenue, or they are taken to a medically
infused products laboratory where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into a concentrate, turned into
edibles, turned into a lotion,
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into a lubricant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all kinds of shit with it,
but that medically infused products
[SPEAKER_00]: facility would also go under.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow sinks, so do all of these
subsequent facilities, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: medically infused processor and the
dispensary attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one crop could ruin three
businesses that all fall under one
[SPEAKER_00]: business entity, which would mean you got
probably 15, 20 people at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: or at the grow working, probably maybe
five or 10 people, depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: medically infused, whatever you got going
on, you got five, 20 people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the dispensary, you got probably
20 people working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be somewhere between 20
and a hundred people that are fired and
[SPEAKER_00]: are out of work because of one crop
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are much more critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are much tighter in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something that it matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot use the same methods of
eradication in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to stick to Colorado
Department of Agriculture and Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enforcement Division regulations
when it comes to pesticides and fungicides
[SPEAKER_00]: and cleanliness and things like that
within my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, when people, if I were to
get a clone from a friend, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: think of how to say that safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a clone from somebody,
no matter where it came from, I will treat
[SPEAKER_00]: it with a pesticide that is not allowed in
a commercial grow because that is my way
[SPEAKER_00]: of protecting myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can treat those incoming plants with a
really strong pesticide that I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend unless it's an incoming plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason I have this
pesticide is people say I don't have bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and people like to say that they don't
have diseases, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody knows that they got a
disease or a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I get a plant, I treat it with
some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned my lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got spider mites from somebody,
no names to be said here, but somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me a clone that had the most
ferocious fucking spider mites I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slowed me down, honestly, for a full
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These spider mites, they would not go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed a solid Colorado winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sucking in cold air from the
negative 17 outside, blowing it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look like shit, but eventually
the spider mites died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept treating for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't want to get that problem
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I treat very heavily when plants come
in to prevent problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't do what I do in a commercial
grow because the products that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: applying are actually banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's, I say that I try to
grow from my heart, breed with love and
[SPEAKER_00]: treat these plants with a lot of love,
but that is my preventative measure to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my livelihood, my business afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I let spider mites get in here again
and ruin a bunch of plants, that's a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds you guys don't get to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bunch of herb that Mike and I
don't get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to prevent that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back to the commercial grows
can't use that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the main differences is
the amount of people that come and go and
[SPEAKER_00]: the products which we are allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I was talking about the funding and
the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my crop goes away, that's a couple of
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's six plants, not a big deal,
bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, we've got hundreds,
maybe thousands of plants in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get a problem over here,
in this tray, there are fans, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people walking around, the shit is going
to move around very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one room gets contaminated,
if one table gets an infestation of bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to move around with the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites climb up to the tops of
the plants and they feel the wind and they
[SPEAKER_00]: go, oh, there's a breeze and they put out
a little web and they jump and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: leap of faith and they draw that that web
with them and wherever they land,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where they build the new web to and
they just make that leap of faith and they
[SPEAKER_00]: use the fan to blow themselves around and
try to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they use the grow techs and the
growers to travel around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're jumping on your, if you're wearing
scrubs, they jump on your scrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wearing a t-shirt, they jump on
your t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move around the grow with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're spreading them around the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get one small area infected,
infested with bugs, it moves very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my order of operations is not just
different, but it's more, very more strict
[SPEAKER_00]: and very more stringent in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should loop back around in my
personal grow, it's personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot come there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't bring contractors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't bring inspectors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no investors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, nobody gets to see that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike hasn't even seen the grow in weeks
and months and Clint hasn't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend actually had to ask,
can I see a couple of your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: She had to like ask for permission to
actually get to see the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take anybody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, that is my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share a lot of stuff on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share a lot of my life on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My podcast is all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Instagram all the time doing
Instagram live shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Discord hanging out with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow space is my little Zen area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take people in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't judge me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't disrupt me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't learn my tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't steal my secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my little 10 by 10 area of leave
me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't change the music in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't turn down the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds rude, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to do that with your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gets to go in there but me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely don't have any pets down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No dogs get to go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've got to do for preventative is
much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get home, if I'm going to the grow
space, I simply drop the clothes that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing from the shoes, the socks,
the pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the same undies if you want to
visualize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shirts gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dreads are usually tied up or untied
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going into the grow, I've got a
specific hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tie the locks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them into the specific hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear a couple of outfits that I rotate
into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wash them quite frequently but I've got
specific grow room clothes that I wear in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come from wherever I was,
basically stripped down, put on the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room clothes, go into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I come out, before I go into any other
room, those grow clothes come off and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get stacked into a little bit of a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they get thrown in the washer if
I saw any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'll take a shower before I
even go into that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I got fucking six foot long
dreadlocks so it's kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely shower before I go into every
grow space but I do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that helps me out is I'm
allowed to use different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main standard operating procedures
are very different in my personal grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: in commercial grows because the amount of
people that are coming and going,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of risk that is involved,
the options that we've got for mitigating
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see a problem in my grow I can blast
it with whatever I want that I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also keep in mind people aren't going
to smoke 90% of what I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I grow is seeded so
technically I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think I'm doing this but I could
spray it with everything because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason we worry about spraying
our plants mostly is because we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: people smoking contaminated shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to smoke it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to be seeds which I'm just
hypothetically saying I could treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with all kinds of shit but we can't do
that in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So order of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar order of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plants healthy, keep them bug
free, have an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy and then grow from your heart,
breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order of importance is the same but
the way the operation, the procedures
[SPEAKER_00]: change a little bit because like I said
we've got so many people coming and going
[SPEAKER_00]: at the commercial grows that we've got to
do a little bit of stuff differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says is there an order in which
you enter and exit your grow areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I do in a commercial
environment, if I am the boss which most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the time not to sound egotistical,
I'm the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the guy directing the grow team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to learn what each grower is good
at and what each grower is not good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just hypothetically talk about my
friends Elijah and Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elijah is five foot something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian is six foot something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I have Brian do the shit on the
bottom and Elijah do the shit on the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that Brian can do the tall
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elijah can do the lower stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my job as the kind of the boss,
the director of cultivation, the guy in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge of the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find who is good at what.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I really like to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Cletus likes to be outside a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a job that goes outside,
Cletus gets that job immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some of the growers,
they want to be inside all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a job that goes outside,
don't make him do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get done half ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I try to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that I keep in mind when I'm
assigning tasks for the start of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: is I put a person in a room and I try to
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing Elijah and Brian and Cletus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got rooms A, B, and C,
I will try to put Brian in room A all day
[SPEAKER_00]: so that he doesn't have to come out of
room A and fuck up room B.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't bring the problems from room A
to room B.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elijah would get room C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cletus would get room however I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd give the guys an individual room or
the ladies too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of ladies in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just say guys all the time because it's
just what I fucking say, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the guys and gals have individual
rooms or I'll put three or four guys or
[SPEAKER_00]: gals in one room and just make them stick
in that room so they're not moving the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way that I really focus on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you asked about an order of workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grow, I tend to check on
the clones first and most often because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in triage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in ICU.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones are not alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that dome gets bumped a little bit and
the humidity comes out, we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your clones are going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check those as often as possible,
OCD as frequently as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the smaller plants are probably going
to dry up the soonest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check those next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm in the veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check the bigger veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check those next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course the mother plants are in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check the mother plants next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the clones, the veg, the moms all in
one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that those are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we would check the flowering space
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically start from the starters all
the way up to the enders because my
[SPEAKER_00]: thought process is I need healthy starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're already infested, infected,
contaminated at the end, they're almost
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to ride them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need healthy shit for my next run,
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need healthy moms, healthy clones,
healthy veg, or I cannot have a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus mostly my order of operations,
honestly, in the commercial grow and the
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on the littles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work my way up all the way to the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're checking on burping the jars and
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other fucking conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, does your mother room have a
specialty entrance or exit plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without revealing too much info,
the home grow is a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a bedroom door on it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lock and a key and a bedroom
fucking door.
[SPEAKER_00]: No special grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The windows are covered so nothing can get
in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two great words together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Gorilla Cock to seal all the cracks
and then put tape over that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's getting in and out of there
unless it goes under the door or through
[SPEAKER_00]: the air ducts, which I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the air underneath the door for
passive air intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read more of this question because
I got rambling really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure that I've answered the
question, but I've talked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys asked for longer shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fucking get it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal order of importance in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go personal order of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I did my flow chart,
but order of importance is clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does all the gear work?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I do when I walk
into a commercial grow is I make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been there for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anything break?
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach the new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, all right, now we got to go
find out what went wrong last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, something broke last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: A timer died.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pump failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something fucking shorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something somewhere broke last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smallest to largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scout a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I come back from lunch, probably
because I'm blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fucking took fat dabs at lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just cruise and look for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go cruise a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send the guys in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go, guys and girls, just go scout for
bugs right after lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see if you see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, get back to work business as
usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order of importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about doing the small plants up
to the biggest plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really change at home on order
which I enter or exit the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since my home grow is basically two small
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's something in that space,
it got in both spaces probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do the veg stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the flower stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you ask about how I prevent from
moving problems around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically in a commercial grow,
the way that I do that is I try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: people in specific rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to lunch, when we go to break,
I try to remind the guys to take off
[SPEAKER_00]: their, if they're wearing a jacket or a
hoodie or something, I try to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: special shirt, special shoes and stuff for
each grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's hard to implement certain
SOPs at some grows when I'm not fully 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take my advice and my guidance,
but they won't always take everything as
[SPEAKER_00]: instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does my mother room have a special
entrance and exit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to get those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can step on the floor mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got pesticides inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stomp around on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will kill all the shit on your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places we use booties,
just little shoe covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places we do use a hair net and a
beard net.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places we do scrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places, honestly bro,
we walk in and out of everything in our
[SPEAKER_00]: regular fucking clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on which facility and what
the owner agrees with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner kind of makes the final move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a shared mom and veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to help keep my mom plants
safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about viruses lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between, if you go from your veg plants to
your mother plants, consider dunking your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors in bleach and cleaning those
scissors before you go cutting on your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if you do, and if you've got the
viroid, it's probably in the mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you don't want to move it around,
perhaps maybe it would help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a shared mom, clone,
veg space as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll be just fine with that
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I like starting in the veg
mom room, closing everything up and moving
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever worked backwards?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're clean and paying
attention and not moving problems around,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you've got a strategy,
a standard operating procedure that works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, that's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things of growing
cannabis is that my way works and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be totally different than your way,
and your way is not wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as at the end of it we're both
sitting here at the table smoking a bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go, I'm satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what fucking matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're satisfied with the weed
you grew, I'm satisfied with the weed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew, we didn't do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you really do it wrong is if
the plant died, then you obviously did it
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you burned some shit down, you did it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get somebody sick by using a
pesticide improperly, you did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say if you go to jail you did
it wrong, but that might not even been
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have just been some fuckery
there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're smoking weed and you're
happy with the way that it came out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be things I do differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be things I wouldn't do or maybe
things that I would do in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you've got an outcome that
you're smoking, you're not doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a thousand ways to skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably a thousand ways to grow
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what I love about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been establishing, developing,
and I don't want to say perfecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but honing my way for several years now to
the ability, to the effect, to the level
[SPEAKER_00]: where I feel like I can teach you guys to
follow my standard operating procedure and
[SPEAKER_00]: have great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also encourage you to do it your
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow is not the same as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lights are not the same as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants aren't the same as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have an astronomical fucking
budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy all those new lights that
came out last week that I've been looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at going, when do they come out with this
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may not have any budget at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be duct taping fucking old street
lamps to the ceiling to make that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got a different setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to grow the best herb that we
can so that whenever we hang out,
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever we don't feel right, whenever we
want to feel better, we can smoke the best
[SPEAKER_00]: herb that is available and we can produce
it ourselves and not have to rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got rambling pretty good there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure how long I've been
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call this a podcast,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time recording this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had as good of a time as I do.

your constructive criticism, your positive
[SPEAKER_00]: words of affirmation, or if you want to
tell me there's something to correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.

growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me that feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, do not forget about the Patreon
campaign at patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is on the website.

[SPEAKER_00]: Some things come and go very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what I might post up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do some crazy deals on that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll be back in a couple of days
with fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to Ben the
web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
Thank you so much for watching.
Good night.
