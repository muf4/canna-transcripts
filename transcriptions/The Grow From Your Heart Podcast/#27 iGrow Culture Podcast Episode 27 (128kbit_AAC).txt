bunch of news and some chatting because
[SPEAKER_00]: this weekend, the weekend that just passed
by the time this comes out, this will be
[SPEAKER_00]: out on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the weekend I got to see
Phish at Dick's in Denver, and they played
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my favorite songs, and we had a
wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's my prediction, hopefully that
comes true.

[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done the news in a while,
so we're going to get you nice and caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to turn up Nickatee for a
couple of seconds while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, if you want to say anything,
now's your chance, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm pretty good right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you look, it may be best if you
just keep your head down right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not even sure he's there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on, I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to give a huge shout out
to Spence and the entire Garden of Weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and Crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing some live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's strange is that I'm so high,
I just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written on there, but it's upside
down over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Yeti OG live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so high, I couldn't remember the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's so dank, I couldn't remember the
name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all dabbed out right now and
everything sounds like I'm in a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said the word epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to cough my brains out and then
we're going to scroll to some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news I found entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is coming from The Cannabis and it is
by Ricardo Baca from The Cannabis Staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topic says, Pot Shop Owner,
80% of our customers come from out of
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam's over there shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an out of stater, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am an out of stater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your out of state ID qualifies you as out
of stater.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm no longer an out of stater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a resident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here longer than 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they don't realize that when
they check your... No, totally not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that because I'm a red card patient
and the place that has my card or the
[SPEAKER_01]: place that I like to go to anyways,
my preferred place is now recreational and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a line to get in to get your meds?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can only take two people back at one
time and it's the same building,
[SPEAKER_00]: same... How long does that line take?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been out there since they've
really done it besides one or two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I walked right in there because
there was nobody on there, but the other
[SPEAKER_01]: times there's been five or six people
ahead of me and people walk in behind me
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just turn around and walk out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a long time to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have a shop downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hurting for the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would wait in line for an hour
because the whole front of the place would
[SPEAKER_00]: be full.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to get into this
article a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Ryan Griego owns a recreational
pot shop in Southern Colorado and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out a bold informed estimate
saying that a decidedly clear majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: his customers are from outside of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big breath here
because I can't even read after that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the dispensary this guy is from is
actually, they posted a really cool shot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Canna sewer in this article online
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really cool angle of the sign and the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The style shook in place with a great
Colorado background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a dope shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: A dope shot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even mean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm back on my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of my customers are coming from other
states, predominantly Texas, New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas, and Arizona said Griego owner of
Canna sewer in Pueblo West, which opened
[SPEAKER_00]: its doors in May for recreational
marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew there would be out of state
customers coming in, but I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be more of a 30 70 split with 30% of
my customers from out of state,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's more severe than that on the
flip-flop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think severe was the right word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of state tourists account for 44% of
all retail sales in the Denver area and
[SPEAKER_00]: about 90% in mountain resorts,
such as Aspen or Telluride.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to a recent study produced by
the Colorado marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, we've talked about the marijuana
enforcement division or the med.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the guys, the division in charge
of regulating the dispensaries and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in charge of the marijuana and
they regulate all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the rules and they are also a
branch of the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a huge place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking put their foot down and it
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys tweet me every time I say the F word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I say fuck, just tweet me and
tell me to stop doing it, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm trying to stop doing that on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to cut that word out of my
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a cool word to use for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, but for a shop in Pueblo
hardly considered in the same tourism
[SPEAKER_00]: league as Aspen or Telluride to make 80%
of its sales to out of state visitors is
[SPEAKER_00]: something and of an anomaly, even given
Pueblo's proximity, less than a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: miles to the New Mexico state line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're not joking at all about the
differences between Aspen, Telluride
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Pueblo is, uh, it's a cool place if
you live here and you know where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going, but is a, uh, it's a steel town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a steel mill town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blue collar working man's town and
Aspen and Telluride are places where you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to spend some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have, we have a reservoir here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've got a river walk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some really cool trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a castle about 30 minutes from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Pueblo is definitely nice to come
and see, but there's nothing here to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although has this, it has everything that
a normal town has and it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say that 80% of our sales are going
to out of state visitors, uh, is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a lot of recreational weed
shops here and the shop that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about is 100% recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that the numbers are the
same across the board at the shops at the
[SPEAKER_00]: rec shops that it's 70 30?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it depends on your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I was going to get at
because the reason that the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: market is not shopping at a recreational
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're either, and I haven't read this
article in advance very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skimmed it because if I found it
interesting for the show, uh, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: a Colorado resident, like you did,
you became a resident, you got your
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana recommendation from a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your red card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can shop at a medical shop and not
pay the 25% tax that's added onto the rec
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, probably you get better herb
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at the med shops, but also,
uh, most of the Colorado residents have
[SPEAKER_00]: been here and we have a guy or a caregiver
or just, you've got the hook or you start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your own or you're growing your
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used, I literally used the rec shops and
until I got my red card and then once I
[SPEAKER_01]: got my red card, then I, I used it all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't, I went into the rec shop with
somebody who just came here recently and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking for a certain product and
that's, I went in there because for one,
[SPEAKER_01]: she hadn't ever done it before and it's an
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yep, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bottle of apothecanna extra
strength pain cream, Arnica peppermint
[SPEAKER_00]: juniper cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this stuff, I have said on this show
that I'm skeptical of topicals and lotions
[SPEAKER_00]: and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this was actually kicked down by the
grimy Gatsby to me because I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, some shoulder pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had a guest over the other night who
looked like hell when they weren't,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they were sitting at the table,
didn't look like they felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said neck hurts and, uh,
put some of this on my hands and rubbed
[SPEAKER_00]: her neck for about 10 minutes and my hands
were high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hands felt balloony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to quote Pink Floyd, but my hands
felt just like two balloons after extra
[SPEAKER_00]: strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine what that girl's neck
felt like after I rubbed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet she was, or she just slathered it
all over her legs and then like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was talking about, it's just one
that one hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person you shared it with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Adam shared some Colorado cannabis
that I grew with a lightweight and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that kind of wrecked their world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a little back into this
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got high and got distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the person that got a massage
with the freaking cannabis Arnica
[SPEAKER_00]: peppermint juniper cannabis lotion from
apothecanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't even know he's behind the
scenes working shit and you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this article continues to say,
so how did Griego land at these figures,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially given the state of Colorado's
restrictions on tracking recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: customers information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we keep seeing these statistics and
that's a question I've raised twice now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the second time somebody has
raised it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're, you've already explained it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're not tracking your name so
much as they're just tracking your
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, he comments on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says we have a media group that we
hired on and they monitor all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: social media and Google analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've paid close attention to the
progression of people searching on PCs and
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Griego said a lot of these numbers come
from inside the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has to show ID and we check IDs
twice, once in reception and again in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus our bud tenders are always making
friendly conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asking people where they're from.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% is Griego's educated guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while he knows he sees traffic
locally, as well as from nearby,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, weedless Colorado towns, Colorado
Springs, Walsenburg, Trinidad and La
[SPEAKER_00]: Junta.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, he says definitively that he sees
more Texans than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a big state though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our bro Kevin works at a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not here tonight, but he works at a
dispensary and he says it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Texans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not surprisingly the out of state
customers are also spending more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: Coloradans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, uh, I want to know what you guys
are paying for herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might've, we did this on my Facebook
page on the IRE genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you guys are paying
herb in your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me at I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know, give me a good, don't tell me
exactly where you are, but let me know
[SPEAKER_00]: what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe what part of that state and let me
know what good high grade herb or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: herb is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what it costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll tell you in Colorado,
uh, I don't go to the shops, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what an ounce Kevin knows what
it's, um, actually we had a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she said it was four 60 that yeah,
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the high end of price as a,
as a caregiver, my patients, you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: them for three 50 if you shopped around
and it wasn't really like, I want this
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and this, you know, you can still
find it cheaper depending on where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, recreational that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know what you guys are
paying, uh, on the street right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado ounces, depending on what you
want, you can find an ounce for $150.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe buy it for medical or,
uh, but, uh, for the fire, it's about 200
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks, 225 for a good tank ounce right now
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on, you know, if you're,
if you're just random dude, if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the hookups, I would rather go 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me, just that extra 50 and get
that, that dank, that top shelf Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got to go to the dispensaries and
get it, it's going to run you close to
[SPEAKER_00]: $500 an ounce for that same 225,
$200 ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense, but, and I guess it's the
Colorado people are getting that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that the caregivers are growing or their
buddies with the caregiver grow or having
[SPEAKER_00]: some extra on or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that private Kush is a little bit
better than the shop lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's harder for someone to
get on with a caregiver, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you don't have a medical
debilitating condition where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I'm not, I'm not medical because I'm
in a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or I have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just knowing somebody that you trust
and want to assign as your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's something we kind of skipped
over guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about caregiver and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a, and now actually the word
is now provider in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're back in the day, it was
caregiver, but that was, sounds confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get your medical marijuana
recommendation from a doctor, there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend that you use medical
cannabis and they sign papers and you send
[SPEAKER_00]: that paper into the Colorado state
registry and they send you back a card
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a registry card that says you are
registered with state of Colorado to use
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you fill out your paperwork,
you were allowed to sign, designate a
[SPEAKER_00]: person that is called your provider,
which used to be your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person, uh, the paperwork says they
have to be responsible for something other
[SPEAKER_00]: than just, um, procuring your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should drive them to their medical
marijuana doctor's appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should probably make them a kale
smoothie and work on their fucking person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, fuck again, somebody tweet me and
tell me to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a note in front of me still watch
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you make them a, you go sit,
you spend time with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make them a shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to deal with their overall
wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a caregiver, I think sitting
like you and I do, we hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not your caregiver, but when you're
having a bad day, when something's driving
[SPEAKER_01]: you nuts, I got my red card the same day
you renewed and you were there with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple of my patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that one of the guys is an
older cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's a 60 year old guy and him and I,
he's my bro because like you come and sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table, sit at the table and you're
having a bad day and we talk and you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people that have AIDS, cancer,
major shit, they don't have those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need someone to talk to because
a lot of people are afraid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're sick, people abandon you or
you just need extra distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need extra support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need extra support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if those people are there,
you can always use, I'm a young,
[SPEAKER_00]: energetic, youthful dude with a good
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spit right across the table at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that one, but I didn't say
fuck about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think being a caregiver, that's part
of it going and I write down spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: counseling on my, when they say,
what else do you provide?
[SPEAKER_00]: I make smoothies and shakes for these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drive them to their appointments and I
provide spiritual counseling, just being
[SPEAKER_00]: your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but so the caregiver is a person that
is responsible for providing your
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the actual Colorado law does say
that they are allowed to charge you money
[SPEAKER_00]: to cover the cost of your labor and your
lights and your expenses, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to profit off of caregiver care,
get your caregiver ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your provider ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, you can, so you can be a
caregiver in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is decide that you want
to be a caregiver and learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and then find somebody that trusts you
enough, uh, and then work out something
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the dispensaries I don't think are the
centers don't give you a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just give you a little bit of a
discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my guys, the third people that I'm
responsible for right now, there are four
[SPEAKER_00]: people, uh, and I know pretty much exactly
how much I can predict when they need
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be sitting around one night and go,
Oh, it's about time for patient A to give
[SPEAKER_00]: me a call tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put them a little package
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know what he needs and when he
needs it, that way they kind of have more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a specific and exactly what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, high CBD, high T H exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow that Tora Bora cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the night nurse was bred for a
specific person.
[SPEAKER_00]: His two favorite strains are grateful dog
and Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bred them together basically to make
the perfect medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for one of my patients, I went,
I went that far for this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I know it's going to be a killer
strain, but I mean that he was,
[SPEAKER_00]: he inspired that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, you're not probably not going
to go wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you do, you know, it's a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's all an experiment sitting there
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give that thing a little
smell, I've smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the night nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely frosty, but DNA genetics
lets me use their Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me permission to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got their award winning cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they let me use that to breed to the
grateful dog and it came out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to run a bunch of testers
and maybe one day we'll put that to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely like the nature's green
remedies.com because I'm more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: indica smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you're more of the sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's weird about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like indica flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I'm going to smoke a joint,
I want it to make me sit down and chill
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, well, I just want a joint seems
more like, uh, sitting in a hammock with
[SPEAKER_00]: my feet up with the little dreadlock girl
cuddled up next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some grateful dead on the radio and a
nice breeze that's smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dabs are like taking shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink alcohol, but it reminds me
of when I used to drink Jägermeister or
[SPEAKER_00]: tequila.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, it's more energetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my head spin a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't relax well after dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to do shit unless I take
a half gram dab and want to sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't do that tonight on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do a large dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the large dab thing is almost coming
to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel as good about it as I used
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, your lungs have so many inhales and
exhales, and I'm assuming by doing a half
[SPEAKER_00]: gram dab, I'm probably using a multiple
inhale and exhales, uh, for each dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to live a little bit longer
than I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a kid, I didn't realize one day
I was going to fall over and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, we may do a grand finale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may do like a gram dab or a two gram
dab or something episode 100 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, 50 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the stars, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to do it so that that way we
can retire the super large dab thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put the dab challenges to a rest
and say, Hey, we're all alive and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do the life challenge after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're way off topic on this news thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, weed's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 200, 150 an ounce,
but these shops are selling it for 500 an
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce close enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think weed is expensive where you
live, even though it's legal here,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not the cheapest for recreational
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's massively available between the hours
of eight and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a random question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from a state where cannabis was,
uh, hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've told me stories about waiting on
your dude for hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that it was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that everybody is too busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other drugs that are more
important than your $10 dime bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, it's Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys could imagine what kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was a, but when I moved
back, so would you rather have,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa, the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it's refreshing multiple times
and freaking me out, but it went right
[SPEAKER_00]: back to where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the music didn't cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you rather have, uh, so street weed
is cheaper, a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to say 30 bucks an eighth on
the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how much is an eighth of weed at the
dispensary where you would shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that you can go get your med weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 30 at my shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have deals every fourth and the 20th
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much is it rec recreational?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 bucks an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 55 to 60, just depending on which store
would you rather have the convenience of
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the store and just paying the
extra money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you rather sit there and wait for
some high ass dude to show up with a sack?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a gram or a, uh,
just a, a joint, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-roll or something like that,
we're going to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was eight bucks or 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could go out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs you a little bit of gas because
it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's outside of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some places have it, you know,
closer, closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I lived out there,
it'd be a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you could go buy a joint,
you know, I mean, it's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that to me, I'm not going to go out
there and do it just because I,
[SPEAKER_01]: you move here, you get kind of picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everybody in Colorado is a damn
weed snob now or all kind of sewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already a weed snob before I moved
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only smoke Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would give me weed and I'd be like,
did you flush this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you even flush bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush your weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy is one of the easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost free and it's one of the
easiest things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flush your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help out so much and cure and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a whole, that's, I can talk
for hours about curing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I will one day, but those are the
two things back East that people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of people are failing
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of Facebook posts about,
does anybody in Colorado know how to cure
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to build a humid room
and control your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just ranting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get back to the article
because I said I had a lot of news and at
[SPEAKER_00]: this rate, we're not going to get a lot of
news and news story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a podcast, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's going the way it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: These out of state consumers, because
remember we're talking about people from
[SPEAKER_00]: out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how far it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: These out of state consumers are spending
much more than locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Griego said they're spending about twice
as much as locals, about 120 to $140.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles are the most popular with these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of state consumers can buy up to seven
grams of cannabis total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see them buy one to two grams of
bud and the rest of their allotment made
[SPEAKER_00]: up of edible products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not up to date with that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to look that up in the
future here and talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your edible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really distinguish between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm saying your edibles for this is
for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of staters.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does my edible count as?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you and Kevin already went over
this where it was going to be weighed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the metric gram or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to Google that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find that out for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me to check that out and we'll put
that on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I just saw fish this weekend
while you're listening to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm forgetful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need some pep talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get back to the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's illegal to cross state
boundaries with legally purchased Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, does Griego and his staff
inform these consumers, says customer,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, about that very serious state law?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where I have the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person that I got to try that cream
was very vocal inside the store and asking
[SPEAKER_01]: where she could take hearsay products
since it was high in CBD, just product in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: After informing her three times,
he got like, hey, can we stop saying
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about taking it where you're not
supposed to?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, when you come to Colorado,
what Adam's eluding to is have some class,
[SPEAKER_00]: be careful what you say in the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking, can I put this in my
car and go back to Texas?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I put this in my suitcase and fly back
to California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not allowed to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's amnesty boxes in the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is ways to pack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical marijuana patient in
California and you're flying, figure that
[SPEAKER_00]: one out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to encourage that,
but you're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave all the medical states
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're not supposed to leave Colorado
with Colorado marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really not supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't encourage it in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're going to California,
if you're going to fucking Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's illegal.
Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is forms and laws and procedures
because I've seen people for cups bring
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial amounts just in their
backpacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is forms and procedures go through
that if you really want to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're not going to be like,
can I bring my quarter home to Kentucky?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shop at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says, when people come in,
we're all about safety and state
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance, and we make sure that the out
of state consumers are aware that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing... This is written weird,
but it says that it's for in-state
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also remind them that they can't do it
in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the shops remind you that's stuff when
you're there because you have an out of
[SPEAKER_00]: state ID?
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just really depends on how busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're having a slow day, they'll chat
you up a little bit, but if there's 10
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the waiting room, they're not
informing you of nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to buy this much?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most of the recreational shops,
the pre-rolls are actually just shake and
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit, and you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if bullshit counts on the
cuss jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that count in the cuss jar?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fair?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the F word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, check out the can of sewer in this
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't endorse any dispensary,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shop at most dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that you keep saying your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture of the can of sewer here has a
window cut out, and you can see into their
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are from another state and you want
to see a pretty stylish-looking grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard that from many people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks cool in this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very stylish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I don't know what their
product is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in there and they sell you,
hey, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody looks like I may be right about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say that on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to have an opinion,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of five stars, how many?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to give any rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just heard stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of stories as well from
about a lot of the shops here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a med patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of our customers are coming from out
of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good article there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you guys would be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's click over back to the recording and
see how many hours we've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 30 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to squeeze in some more stuff,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent an email to Jody Emery asking if
I'm allowed to play parts of a Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_00]: video on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am, I plan to play a little bit of
Mark's speech that he gave recently after
[SPEAKER_00]: he was released from federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched this and actually linked it to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a powerful, motivating speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is on the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he does get the permission to do it,
I won't ruin it for you, but everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: should watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't inspire you to get up off
your feet- You want to take a risk and
[SPEAKER_00]: just play some of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, or we can just talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to talk what it's
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being innovative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The audio, I don't think we'll be in
trouble for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we don't play video or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's click over here and pause the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to play a little bit of
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't prepared to do it, but we're
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you kind of play towards the end of it,
it would kind of relay the message more of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, unless you want to play the whole
video later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about I'll play a couple of intro
seconds when he takes the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was introduced at one point and he
brought his friend back on stage to-
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emery is introduced by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emery comes on stage and gives thanks
to another friend and hands the mic to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy talks for about eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Mark Emery comes back on stage and
starts his little, not little,
[SPEAKER_00]: his big speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with, it's about 10 minutes
and 25 seconds into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a shout out to the
YouTube page that I'm playing it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be polite here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are, I asked for permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten the email back saying yes
or no yet, but- They're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they let me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jody Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't she want Mark's- Preach the
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from PotTV on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Cannabis Culture's website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please- I subscribe to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I beg for your forgiveness if I wasn't
supposed to do this, but I'm sure you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: want this message out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll play a few seconds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll find out if we can play a lot
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can play a bunch, we'll go ahead and
play a couple of minutes of it for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start off this Mark Emery video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was kind of a weird transition here
that randomly happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Mark Emery right after he,
I think he's like 48 hours out of prison
[SPEAKER_00]: when he did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: 48, something like that he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click play and we'll have to
adjust the sound while it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure it out on the fly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun to be me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I even said that while I was in prison
because doing something, let's almost use
[SPEAKER_07]: the word noble, doing something on
principle, giving a good chunk of your
[SPEAKER_07]: life in sacrifice, I guess, for principle,
even in prison was highly regarded.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the four and a half years I was in
prison, I really never heard an unkind
[SPEAKER_07]: word spoken to me by any inmate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in a medium security prison for
almost all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of these people are serving life in
prison without parole.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've come down from the penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're covered in tattoos.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bad ass dudes, a lot of them,
or at least they think they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're serving horribly long sentences,
by and large, for drugs, mostly
[SPEAKER_07]: methamphetamine, crack, cocaine,
but certainly there were many,
[SPEAKER_07]: many people there for marijuana serving
10, 15, and even in one case, 25 years for
[SPEAKER_07]: marijuana distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to be very productive in jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I blogged.
[SPEAKER_07]: I read a book every week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had 25 magazine subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the New York Times every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I learned how to play the bass.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in an outstanding rock and roll band
of incredibly talented musicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of them were very patient in teaching
me, at no charge for anything,
[SPEAKER_07]: music and music principles and how to be a
bass guitarist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I must tell you that it was a very
redemptive and meaningful experience being
[SPEAKER_07]: in prison.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I always carry the message forward
that I saw there, that it is a very wrong
[SPEAKER_07]: society that punishes people for drugs and
puts them in jail for decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes them away from their family and
their children and essentially ruins their
[SPEAKER_07]: life because of a lifestyle choice they
made.
[SPEAKER_07]: We manufacture crime.
[SPEAKER_07]: With the drug laws, we actually- All
right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emery can talk for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of fade out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam's telling me that I should play the
stuff at the end of the video because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more moving and compelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to save that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tease it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure that I can get
permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about a minute and a half there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I don't get in any kind of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they take down this episode,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it was was some news and a Mark Emery
rant anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just cut that out and we'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go watch the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message after he gets through this,
what I did in jail stuff, that's moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: His message towards the end is definitely
what you need to hear and it's what we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take 30 minutes and watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they let me play that, I'll play the
last few minutes at the end of this show
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wait for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get the email by the time I
post the episode, then I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver, part of this article,
I'm going to kind of paraphrase it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of stuff and the episode's
getting long already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple more things I want to read
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from The Cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually published August 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Alida Labak from The Cannabis
staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say that right, I'm sure,
but I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor John Hickenlooper placed these
giant cages around places in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put one in front of a skate park.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put one in front of a library in
Denver, the Denver Public Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big cages that look like your
hamster cage and they call it a lab rat
[SPEAKER_00]: cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lab rat cage that says,
don't be a lab rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inside, it's got a little thing
that tells you about cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that cannabis can cause you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's saying, don't be a lab rat to
cannabis to encourage kids to not smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you put a big 12 foot tall lab
rat looking cage with a giant,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like those water bottles that hang
upside down that your hamster licks to get
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got a little green thing on the
outside that talks about cannabis on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little note.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to come around on the side of
the computer, bro, and take a look,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like a people cage for
hamsters or a hamster cage for peoples.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a people cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a people cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the article says, well,
that didn't take long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Colorado debuted its don't be
a lab rat youth campaign on Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: August 11th by dropping human sized
laboratory cages around the Denver area,
[SPEAKER_00]: including outside the Denver Public
Library and the downtown skate park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vandalized signs at the skate park
installation were reported Monday evening
[SPEAKER_00]: by CBS4.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cages feature posters that cite
controversial marijuana research studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask open ended questions about youth
pot use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that was a hard sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cleverly crossed out a reference to
negative effects of marijuana and changed
[SPEAKER_00]: it to positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although another message left on the
poster says, critically, smoking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The campaign, which targets teens with
messages that marijuana research is
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing, particularly in studies of
studies of the developed developing brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: is trying a different tact from the just
say no anti drug campaigns of your.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few variations of the posters
that adorn the giant cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a new message is sure to replace the
vandalized signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vandalism was taken in stride by Dr.
Larry Wolk, who leads the state health
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are defacing it or they're doing
something with regard to graffiti or
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering in the cages, at least they're
taking notice and let the debate occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably just breaking that shit
while they're smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be perfectly honest, there was also the
man who talked up inside the cage at the
[SPEAKER_00]: skate park, according to the TV station
report.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a marijuana activist?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like there's not enough
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously people got off their
ass and signed, you know, enough papers
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's legal here, you know,
the two million dollar project,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes a stylized website is
funded by a grand by a grant paid by legal
[SPEAKER_00]: sediments with settlements with various
pharmaceutical companies, according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: governor's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another component of the don't be a lab
rat lab rat campaign are the TV ads as
[SPEAKER_00]: seen below.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to watch these stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does Big Pharma get off by telling
you not to be a lab rat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they need they need your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want you on Zoloft instead of weed,
but dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these most of our listeners probably
haven't seen these gigantic lab rat cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've posted their three or four stories
on the cannabis about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were down there the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have gone and checked it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to jump around on this side
again and take a look, there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: people inside of this one as they were
building it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll move the email out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the people cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working with right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially a lion cage from the zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a lion cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a large cat, small
enclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that 10 by 10 by 10 by 10 by 10?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, by 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think it's that it's probably
12 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably longer than it is wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of scrutiny about how
kind of ridiculous it is to from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people by the looks of these websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me click and see how long we're
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bigger than a jail cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them just going to keep moving on
with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are about 40 minutes in, so we can keep
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make this a perfect hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet if we do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to save a couple of minutes for
the Mark Emory part if we get a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something random in this only
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading this because this supports the
legalization, the nationwide legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: and decriminalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline will say it all for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Hampshire declares state of emergency
over spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to cure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us just smoke the weed we want to
smoke instead of having to smoke fake
[SPEAKER_01]: spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that is probation and and
probation and prohibition and job testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I I I had personal experience with
this where people were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, it's better than sex, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to I've never and I was like,
all right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, I will never again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the toilet for six hours like
hacking my lungs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Felt like a piece of shit.
Yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't ever smoke spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that listen to my show won't
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adam, Adam will try anything twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only did spice once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to read some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even seem like we need this
gets the point across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't fucking legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I just said fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tweet me and tell me to quit
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrible word.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to quit doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalize cannabis and we won't have to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't have to smoke spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employers and probation, some probation,
you can't drink alcohol, but employers
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care if you go out at five o'clock
or six o'clock or if you go down to panic
[SPEAKER_00]: hour at six fifteen and drink twenty two
beers, your employer doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you smoke a fat joint, man,
you might get fired from your job,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor Maggie Hassan has declared a
state of emergency to allow public health
[SPEAKER_00]: officials to investigate and quarantine
synthetic drugs linked to recent overdoses
[SPEAKER_00]: in Manchester and Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is New Hampshire, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Authorities say at least 41 people in the
Manchester area have experienced serious
[SPEAKER_00]: medical reactions to synthetic
cannabinoids known as spice that are
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically engineered substances similar
to the active ingredient in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's scrutinize this sentence just for
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that's what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, uh, it's poser pot known as spice
that are chemically engineered,
[SPEAKER_00]: that chemically engineered substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's close, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active ingredient in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana doesn't have ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a compound, I think, is what you'd
want to call it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come on, guys, you're the cannabis,
brah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you even cannabis, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord police have reported at least
three cases since Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hassan's declaration gives the State
Department of Health and Human Services
[SPEAKER_00]: the power to investigate, quarantine,
and require the destruction of the
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says the department will work with the
police to quarantine the bubblegum flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: of a product named smacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such products are labeled as herbal
incense but are known to be smoked or
[SPEAKER_00]: brewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants to take a product called
smacked?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I might take a dab of a
strain called smacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but not a spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people have been doing this for
years, but they put them in boilers and
[SPEAKER_01]: use them in rooms, you know, like large
rooms to give everybody that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: A frankincense and myrrh has been used for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just imagining what if... Just for
years, but they never grabbed it and put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the bong and like, yeah,
let's get baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they had herb for that because it
wasn't against the law then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it wasn't... All around the
world, it's still looked at as something
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy and people are going to try to get
it one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's some decently uplifting news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah Medical Marijuana Program,
11 cards issued, several for child
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by Michelle L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price of the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Salt Lake City, Utah issued nearly a
dozen registration cards in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: month of its limited medical marijuana
program that allows those with severe
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy to possess cannabis extract oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was August 9th, so this is kind of
old news, but I just wanted to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: some news and catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of Friday evening, the state has issued
11 cards since the program started July
[SPEAKER_00]: 8th, said Janice Houston, the state
registrar and director of the Utah
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Health's records office.
[SPEAKER_00]: About half of those 11 cards were issued
for child patients, Houston said.
[SPEAKER_00]: An application for another card is
pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Department officials on Friday also
announced the $400 annual fee for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cards had been cut in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program startup fee were less than
expected and the registration cards will
[SPEAKER_00]: now cost $200, Houston said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there are 11 cards and one more
being applied for in the state of Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a party the other night and there
were probably 11 medical marijuana cards
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge relief, said Jennifer May,
with hope for children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been trying to find ways to help the
families come up with that money,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the money for the oil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who already paid the higher fee will
be refunded, health officials said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah's law doesn't allow the distribution
of medical marijuana, but it permits those
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting certain requirements to possess
the extract after getting it from other
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can at least get what they need to
from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a step in the right direction,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extract called cannabidiol is believed
to help with severe seizures, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: those experienced by children with a
severe form of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georgia is also looking at that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an extract called cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid, but one of
the cannabinoids in the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice try, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucked me up a couple times in this
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the oil doesn't have the psychoactive
properties that gets users high and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed with foods such as applesauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if they'd be able to bring back
the OG caps because those OG caps from
[SPEAKER_00]: essential extracts available at Natural
Mystic Cannabis Caregivers, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical shop.
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to have to get a Colorado
residency and get a medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado to even acquire this type of
medicine to get it to Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe not in Dipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe there's something a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of cannabidiol varies depending
on the size of the patient and the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dose the patient is receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a hundred pound person, a month's
supply of a beginning dose is about 40
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A maximum dose for the same patient could
cost up to nine hundred dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they are talking about seems to be
Phoenix tears, Rick Simpson oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: full plant cannabis extract, full extract
cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's orally eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's black usually or greenish colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not talking about dads or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are familiar with that,
there's a movie called Run from the Cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Race for the Cure is run from the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rick Simpson story search for the name
Rick Simpson and then put cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find the movie I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say Rick Simpson may have
stolen that recipe and gotten famous off
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's helping a lot of people do your
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Rick Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did a give thanks section on
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main producer of the extract in
Colorado has a waiting list with thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of names and doesn't expect to have more
supply until fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other producers of the product have
also also have a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_00]: May said because Utah's registration cards
expire year after year, many families are
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to apply later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 100 families are expected to take
advantage of Utah's program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Department officials said May,
whose 12 year old son can suffer hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of seizures a day, said she and many other
families are also waiting to see if they
[SPEAKER_00]: can secure a spot in a pending drug trial
by neurologists at Primary Children's
[SPEAKER_00]: Hospital in Salt Lake City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once families receive a registration card,
they could face additional hurdles to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get the extract from other
states, including enrolling in that
[SPEAKER_00]: state's medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: All state marijuana programs, medical or
otherwise, are still illegal under federal
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some doctors and advocacy groups have
warned there's no proof the extract is
[SPEAKER_00]: effective at treating epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But families say it's worth the time and
cost if it brings relief to those
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering from seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think these people are going to pay
$400 or now $200 to get the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card that they require?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go spend money in another state?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to travel to Colorado to get
this oil that costs up to $900 for a
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking dose, a month dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to drive from Colorado to
Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to spend a couple of hundred
bucks in gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to spend a day away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably traveling with a child
with seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to waste and excuse this
one, are they going to waste that fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: time if this medicine doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there must be something working,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's that documentary that I
linked you not that long ago that
[SPEAKER_01]: literally you watch these people uproot
their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come out here and they try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure I've seen that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they go back to their home state and
their home state's giving them a point
[SPEAKER_01]: zero or zero point something CBD value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to uproot their lives and
move to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a million stories like it
all over, you know, throw a stone here and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can pretty much find what they're
calling the marijuana refugees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude, the story you just read said
half the people we get are coming from out
[SPEAKER_01]: of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think he said 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would, why would people not come here
to help their children?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is in desperate need.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are packing up their entire lives
and moving to another state because we can
[SPEAKER_00]: offer them a medicine that is obviously
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to say it's going to
work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The union was the first time I ever saw
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that he's all shaky and I
don't mean to be rude about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really shaky and they smoked and it
was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes right back to not shaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we got time for one more quick
news article, Seattle pot tickets,
[SPEAKER_00]: one cop wrote 80% of citations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were they calling that one guy out
there in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it really boomed, there was,
there was one dude out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who I'm talking to that was just
standing outside of pot shops,
[SPEAKER_01]: like writing people's citations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't remember his name,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Seattle police officer has been
reassigned after review, after a review
[SPEAKER_00]: found he wrote about 80% of marijuana
tickets issued in the city during the
[SPEAKER_00]: first half of 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle police chief, Kathleen O'Toole
said 30 or said July 30 on the department
[SPEAKER_00]: website that the unidentified officer
issued 66 of the 83 citations for public
[SPEAKER_00]: pot use in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says that in some cases he added notes
to the tickets or addressed them to
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle city attorney, Pete Holmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other case, the officer reported,
reportedly said he flipped a coin when
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding which person to cite.
[SPEAKER_00]: O'Toole says the officer also wrote on the
voter approved state initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing recreational marijuana was
silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police chief said that the case has
been referred to the department's official
[SPEAKER_00]: of professional accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says the officer won't be on patrol
duties during the investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, big middle finger to that cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I gotta say about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some people smoke some weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know their story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they had something crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe weed killed their dad or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if that had ever happened,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd never killed anybody, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that, but I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that you can be killed by
marijuana, the only way you can be killed
[SPEAKER_00]: by cannabis is if a bunch of it falls on
top of you or if a
[SPEAKER_00]: cop beats you up for having it in your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, it'll happen here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's, that's if you'd have told
me, Mark, you're going to spend the next
[SPEAKER_07]: 25 years, you know, smoking joints and
bongs and selling seeds and you're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to go to jail for many, many years of your
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one day after 25 years of you being
arrested, have you gone to jail?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been taken away?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you losing all your assets of you
being separated from your family and your
[SPEAKER_07]: wife?
[SPEAKER_07]: After all that, you're going to have one
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: One day in 2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can get your people together,
it all ends on that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: On that day, the next day after that day,
the stores will start selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: People will walk the streets confident
about the marijuana in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be medical marijuana science
experiments and advancements every day
[SPEAKER_07]: after that, because it'll be legal to
study marijuana in universities.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be legal for doctors to recommend
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be legal for doctors, judges,
cops, politicians to smoke it and share it
[SPEAKER_07]: and understand it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be legal to go and buy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be legal for ordinary people to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be legal for people to have a
business that grows marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be legal for everybody to make
vaporizes and bongs.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the books and magazines about
marijuana will all be legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one will ever try and ban them ever
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one will ever say a bad thing about pot
smokers as a culture, as a way of
[SPEAKER_07]: demonizing them and sending them to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, Mark, in 25 years, that one day,
everybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a happy, wonderful world ever
since because everybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my message.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a big opportunity coming in 14
months.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be touring the country
relentlessly, telling everybody,
[SPEAKER_07]: even in other countries, you just need one
day where everybody we know who smokes pot
[SPEAKER_07]: shows up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be my message in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be my message in Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be my message in Vienna.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a message all across
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's certainly my message to all
Americans who go to vote in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_07]: Alaska and Florida and Washington District
of Columbia on the first Tuesday in
[SPEAKER_07]: November.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you show up, you'll never need to think
about this ever again.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll just be allowed to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be allowed to be part of a culture
that ought to be one of the most respected
[SPEAKER_07]: cultures in the history of mankind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll tell you this, the cannabis
culture has given more to humanity and
[SPEAKER_07]: mankind humankind in science and
entertainment and theater and arts,
[SPEAKER_07]: books and culture and especially in music
than any other culture of the last hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cannabis culture is one of the
greatest cultures in the history of
[SPEAKER_07]: mankind, starting with William
Shakespeare, who smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so many great poets and writers
and musicians and scientists and doctors
[SPEAKER_07]: and explorers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to this day, our movers and shakers,
Bill Jobs, or sorry, Bill Gates,
[SPEAKER_07]: Stephen Jobs, pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Carl Sagan, pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every musician you've ever cared to really
enjoy a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the people who write today's great
best sellers and make today's great movies
[SPEAKER_07]: are pot smokers, including actors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are a great culture, but we have been
denied our official right to be regarded
[SPEAKER_07]: as first class citizens like everybody
else who makes contributions and who ought
[SPEAKER_07]: to be acknowledged as a culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if they'd have told me 25 years
ago, market's going to be a long road with
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of difficulties.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one day in 2015, one day it all
becomes real if you can get your people to
[SPEAKER_07]: show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my message.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to partying with you
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, that was Mark Emery.
