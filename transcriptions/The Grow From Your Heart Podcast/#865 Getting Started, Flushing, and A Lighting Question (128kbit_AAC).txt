[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 865 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to focus on listener
generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a website that website is
ieregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of that website, there's a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a cool grow question and I
read your question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds at ieregedirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first question came from somebody
who wants to be called Mike Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Mike Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike says I've got a two part question and
I will answer both of those questions for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what size grow tent and type of
seed do you recommend for a first time
[SPEAKER_00]: grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a very good question,
a very fun question.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a first time grower, I would recommend
something like a three by three or a five
[SPEAKER_00]: by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have room for a five by five tent,
that is definitely what I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: and suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a three by three,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to go smaller, of course,
work your way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would recommend that five by five,
that three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two tents are very easy to manage,
very easy to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to get equipment that fits
perfectly inside those tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at AC Infinity, if you do go
check out acinfinity.com, use coupon code
[SPEAKER_00]: iere that will save you a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at AC Infinity make a perfect
package for a five by five tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: a three by three tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order everything in one box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will show up on your front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need are some seeds and some
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend starting with a five
by five or a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, go small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller as you need to, if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the five by five for the
amount of space, the canopy space in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just managing that much space is much
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the right amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, right now, the next seeds that
you purchase from me will have been bred
[SPEAKER_00]: in a five by five AC Infinity tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the five by five because I can
control that environment very perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That five by five space is very easy to
manage the temperature, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to manage the amount of plants
that fit into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right amount of space for the
right size light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a really easy,
perfectly manageable space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That five by five is a really ideal space
for a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said it enough, a three by three,
a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm going to advertise the AC
Infinity tents, the lights, the blowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fans, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity kicks ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the new AC Infinity AI
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically tell it, I want a veg,
and then it says, you're in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it sets all your gear to veg for you,
and you veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it's time to flower,
you tell it, I want a flower, and it goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we'll flower for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the AC Infinity basically puts the
plants into flowering mode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AC Infinity five by five tent is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second part of the question is,
what type of seeds would you recommend for
[SPEAKER_00]: a first time grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend autos or fems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, I'm not a big fan of
the auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a full episode about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to recommend photo period
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a new grower, that sets you up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo period gives you the opportunity
to learn the cycles of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do lollipopping,
defoliation, popping, twisting,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain manipulation techniques and low
stress training techniques to your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn that stuff with the photo
period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The auto flowers don't give you as much of
an opportunity to manipulate and play with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to experiment with that veg
cycle when you are doing the auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend the photo period
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the fems, that's going to help
you minimize your risk of male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, for new growers,
I do always recommend the feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that just sets you up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more step closer to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to watch as closely for
male plants in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the opportunity with all
breeders, with all seeds, that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: that opportunity of a rare male or a rare
intersex plant, the dreaded intersex plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from your fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter who the breeder is, how good
those seeds are, that is still an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do pay attention, but the photo period
feminized seeds are what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a free pack of seeds coming
your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check your inbox for a
coupon code from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can get yourself a free pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend those photo period
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are easily accessible and readily
available on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me jump into this and make sure I
covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A three by three or a five by five
feminized photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC infinity, iRE genetics, and recently AC
infinity teamed up with Athena nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to say jump in,
get the whole trifecta there.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC infinity, iRE genetics, and Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big triangle of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jump in, grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check that coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your inbox for that coupon code for
free seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the flow of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from, I don't have their
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from Electron Dawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electron Dawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your inbox, my dude, because you've
got a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question from Electron Dawn goes a
little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I be flushing my mother plants to
get rid of excess nutrients and then give
[SPEAKER_00]: them pure water for two weeks and then
start nutrients back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says about every two or three
months, give them a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guidance would be much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe there's one of your videos you
can point me to that can help me out with
[SPEAKER_00]: this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the video with the answer to your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gently replied to this listener or this
viewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, why would you flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they said, I'm using two gallon
fiber pots for my mother's.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often should I be flushing the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using basic botanic care veg
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my reply to this, my response to this
is why do you need to flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you flushing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are using the nutrients that
you are feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is eating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you see some sort of major problem
with your plants, I never recommend a
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me talk about quickly what a flush
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flush, a purge, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we would take an amount of
water and we would run that through our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, our media, our soilless mix,
and run that through our plant until we
[SPEAKER_00]: get drainage of that water coming out of
the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed it just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to flush all of the nutrients
out of the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to clean that out, give ourselves
a fresh, clean medium is the thought
[SPEAKER_00]: process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this listener said flush it and give
them pure water for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, your plants are going to be freaking
angry if you don't feed them for two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to starve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get everything deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing problems
within the first seven to ten days,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three to five days, depending on how
big the plants are, how big the containers
[SPEAKER_00]: are, how powerful the lighting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to notice issues if you flush
and do not feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not going to be any nutrition
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never recommend a flush with just
water, even if it's pHed water,
[SPEAKER_00]: unph water, clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever recommend a flush with the
intentions of just cleaning out that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, cleaning out the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never recommend that flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason that it would be
reasonable, in my opinion, is if you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: major problem in your plants, if they were
showing you everything is fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been overfed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I would consider the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be my last option.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do instead of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not this does not apply to
this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this viewer situation, no flush,
not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business as usual, keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see a problem, then consider a
flush, but consider this option first and
[SPEAKER_00]: just hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've got a plant that's
showing you a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be overfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be underfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not quite sure what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've showed it to the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've come to the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's done that thing like a bunch
of old guys with a beer in one hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cigarette in the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking stood around the truck and went,
I think it's your alternator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's your timing belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could be the muffler bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has said their statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's they think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't really know what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many issues appearing and
presenting in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could flush, but that's going to lead
to, like I said, deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant is deficient in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to correct anything,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in my experience, that's going to
make the plant more angry and worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got an overwatered rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your root zone is all saturated with water
and now it's just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant's going, well, now I'm
fucking overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hungry and I don't know what to do
with myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just going to start freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend, mix up for
whatever stage of growth you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in veg, early flower,
mid flower, late flower, those are your
[SPEAKER_00]: basic stages of growth with the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get four or five different phases here,
three trimesters of flower, whatever phase
[SPEAKER_00]: you are in, mix up a batch of a nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you mix, you got your five
gallon bucket, your 250 gallon reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up a feed solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you are very familiar with and you
know works every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower has got a go-to recipe that
they go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit's messing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better go back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go back to that recipe that you
know works every time, it's going to fix
[SPEAKER_00]: your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back to this recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that everything you need is in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your base nutrients, your cow mag,
whatever you're going to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some, definitely throw a bunch of
recharge in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some silicates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through, I'm trying to think of
my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be Botanicare Pure Blend Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what stage we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say we're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Veg
Bottle would be the first bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably silica blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some potassium silicates are going to go
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got our potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to do in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice carb product would be nice in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably enough to liquid karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to add liquid karma almost
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh and Ruby Fulvic from our friends at New
Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're going to mix all that stuff
up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pH it before we put the
recharge in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it at the correct pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what pH you're using but
somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5 probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a consistent pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to add the microbes,
the recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a good stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to water the plants to a
little bit of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some water coming out of the bottom
of these pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough to where we can actually collect it
and measure the EC and pH of that runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend mix your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the pH of that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure that runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll deal with that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do is I want to basically
reset the settings in that rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is in there I want to water that
shit right on out and I want to water it
[SPEAKER_00]: in with brand new feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically give it that whole new meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that last meal was it's sitting
in its gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to push it out with a new
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make all that stuff fall right out and put
a whole new dinner in there so that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in my opinion is the way to restart
whatever plant you think needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really that way we're giving it
everything it needs at the proper dose at
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the best thing you can give the
plant right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper temperature hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it everything that it needs and fix
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reset that instead of completely
fucking disrupting it and then trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: chase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this dude said pure water for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that two weeks everything is
going to be bright yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to be sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need to overfeed
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need to catch up with
that and it's just going to look worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it causes more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed with the well mixed solution
at the proper pH and try to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 20% runoff if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means if you poured a gallon of
water into that plant you want 20% of a
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon maybe a quarter of a gallon to come
out of the bottom of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to scoop some of that up and
we will measure the EC and pH of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's drastic high or low then we will
make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came out close to what it went in
we're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's higher or lower we can understand
what's going on from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make adjustments if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's my long rant about why I do not
flush and why I would recommend mixing a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine if you didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you woke up tomorrow and you just
felt like complete shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it would be more beneficial
to your body, to your health if you mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: up a tea and put some vitamins,
some nutrients, some minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an emergency packet or if you
actually go get some fruit and juice and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything like that going into you is going
to be better than just water and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just peeing out all your own vitamins,
your own minerals, your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some electrolytes, you need some
vitamins, you need to be replenished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think your body would do a lot better
if you fed it a little bit instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: adding water and having to piss a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants are going to act very
similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to push out all the the junk
we don't want, replace it with stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I am quite rambly on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some dabs of some lemon tree I
think it was or was it the you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon buttered rum batter from Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got me battered and rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend Electric
Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric Don, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me rambling quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend flushing ever unless
you see major major problems and still I
[SPEAKER_00]: would flush the little way that I talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright ladies and gentlemen now is a good

[SPEAKER_00]: That's right DGC Cup 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright ladies and gentlemen thanks for
all the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who is going
to be called Atlean415.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels like I've heard that somewhere
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question oh also make sure you check
your inbox for that coupon code for the
[SPEAKER_00]: free seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have some general questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bounce off of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sent me three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to give you one coupon code
for one pack of seeds but I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light leaks can wreak havoc on an
otherwise tuned in run.
[SPEAKER_00]: How exactly do outdoor grows deal with a
light leak?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally address this question around
the beginning of outdoor season because
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like hey I'm putting my plants
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a street light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fucking porch light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoors why don't little lights
disrupt our plants outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see outdoor grows deal with light
leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a light leak?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably a good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors a light leak is what we call it
when your nighttime cycle in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment when it should be dark when
that dark cycle is interrupted and light
[SPEAKER_00]: gets in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a little crack in your in
your tent, a little split in your seams,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether a door gets opened, whether a
light gets left on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a light leak that can cause
detrimental issues to your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the frequency, the power,
a lot of different factors of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants simply may not go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause them to express intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could wreak havoc on everything or
sometimes nothing could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light leak is when the light gets into
your dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we put our plants outdoors and we
expect to get full darkness from the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor environment and our plants should
flower as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we now live in society where
we've got a whole bunch of freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's your porch light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, it could be a car
driving by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a headlight on a dude on a
bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it could be a fucking drone with a
bunch of spotlights on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are light leaks and light and
darkness interruptions now happening to
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't those plants and also we've got
the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget about that big old
skylight that a lot of us use to walk our
[SPEAKER_00]: path at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon, nature's favorite light,
the moon out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't that light fucking up our
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first quickest answer is phytochrome
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun is setting, when the sun is
going down, also I've got another theory
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll touch on this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun sets, it starts to put off a,
it doesn't put off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun sets, it hits the atmosphere
in a way that it creates a spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: light known as far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a spectrum of light that triggers
our plants to do what is called a
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, the sun comes to a certain angle
of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a certain color, a certain
spectrum of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lighting hits our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light, that color of that light tells
our plant, Hey, it's sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should go night night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why sometimes outside at the
outdoor grows, you will see your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: their leaves are up and perky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the sun begins to set, they will go
and you'll go, Oh, the plants know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do because they are getting far
red lighting, which is triggering a
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants that it's telling them,
Hey, it's time for me to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those plants are tucked in by the
far red lighting, they sleep much more
[SPEAKER_00]: deeply than they would in your basic grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going from an led light with
fucking six different colors that was made
[SPEAKER_00]: up by man to darkness, um, maybe a
thousand watt led light in there is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably what most of us are running in a
five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to a thousand Watts of light,
uh, just a little mixed spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's really cool for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that goes off, it's pure,
pure darkness, but compare that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: power of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that sun is cooking, it is the
perfect spectrum for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most powerful spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: No light meter will ever measure how much
sun we're getting compared to a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that sunlight compared to your grow
light is such a vast difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that sunlight tells those plants,
Hey, it's time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to your grow light, it's like
giving them a quadruple dose of Nyquil
[SPEAKER_00]: versus just going sweet dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a big, big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why light leaks are so
detrimental indoors and can cause such
[SPEAKER_00]: major problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outdoors, the plants can take a lot
more light problems because that far red
[SPEAKER_00]: light has tucked them in and they're
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been comatose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tucked in real tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been given that double dose of
Nyquil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rubbed one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a full tummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to wake up and tell
that opposite spectrum happens when the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a blue and white spectrum that
tells those plants, Hey bitches,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time to wake up and get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will start swimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start perking up and start doing
their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens with that blue light
from the sun as it begins to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main factor is that far red
lighting tells them, Hey, go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're soundly tucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second factor is your little
flashlight, your little headlight on the
[SPEAKER_00]: car does not compare at all to the sun
that it's used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like just pulling the curtain
open a little bit and just going,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's a little led light out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's going to go, yeah,
a little led, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pull open the curtains on the sun's
up, we're all going to go, ah,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, the sun's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big difference about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different spectrum, different intensity,
different overall kind of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first answer, far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second answer is that major difference
in intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are two more parts to this
question, which is fun because I'm quite
[SPEAKER_00]: rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part number two, or number B, if you want
to, do you have any personal experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with world plants, world plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when your leaves that should be
sticking straight out and kind of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they look like they're
curling, they're getting, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting all over each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: World means twisting leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the leaves look like they're
spinning around, you've got a tornado
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, in my experience,
that is a light problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, 99% of the time,
that is a light, like a revenge process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've gotten, you've given the plant
more light than you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've increased the amount of hours that
the plant is receiving light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it looked,
but you do podcasting, you'll figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant probably went from,
we'll say 18.6 to 24.0 and that lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep made that plant go wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck, and it's starting to spin
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was on 12.12 and you put it on 18.6
or 24.0 and now those leaves are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to twist and curl going, I don't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, that world plant,
the world leaves come from too much or a
[SPEAKER_00]: changed light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: An increased light cycle is generally what
I've noticed that from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, you're going to find
that it is a lighting issue because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a hormonal thing, which 90% of the
time does come.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably changed the timer and that
plant went fucking nuts or gave it too
[SPEAKER_00]: much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a part three, number C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says when using some type of chemical
induced method for creating pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm making silver thiosulfate is
what they're being specific about and
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding to do open air pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reverse a plant and let
that pollen fly into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of spacing do you give male and
female plants during the tail end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the plants will be into pre flower if
not flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have kind of overthought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no time when that overlaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no overlapping in this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this viewer listener questioner is
asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat a plant with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat it with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will treat it seven times over the
course of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up for debate, but it's going to
get seven solid treatments of this sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: application of silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, it is going to get moved
to another room to pollinate some female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is asking how much space do I
give the male and female plants during
[SPEAKER_00]: that tail end where the plants will be
into pre flower and not flower or end
[SPEAKER_00]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those chemicals transferable to nearby
plants by the air?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what to extend?
[SPEAKER_00]: The product I use is water based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spraying a liquid product on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I've got a five by five tent in
one section of the room and in the other
[SPEAKER_00]: corner of the room is a three by three
with the reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them separate for timing purposes,
but I basically take the reversal
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate out of the tent and it sets
right in the corner of the other corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply the silver thiosulfate sprayed
application to it way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a liquid spray, so it's not really
airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting that fine of mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using a fucking spray bottle like
you'd use to clean the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy those from Uline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see a box of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just buy those from Uline and I mix up a
10% and a 30% silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's marked with the 10, one's marked
with the 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting over there and I just
spray them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't spray willy-nilly where the spray
is going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just right behind that plant, which is a
white wall, is all that's getting hit with
[SPEAKER_00]: my overspray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let it dry completely before I put
it back into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my computer just went to
screensaver and I need my notes here,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it dry before it goes back into the
tent because I don't want the 10 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% dilutions touching each other because
I don't want to get confused on which
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making notes on what to use in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them dry because also I don't want
them under the light when they're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them dry before they go back into
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that process concludes around day 21
or day 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not do my pollination until about
day... Also, that process starts two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead before the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a time period of two weeks
when this plant is being sprayed,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a week, one week when this plant is
being sprayed and the females are in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I stop spraying that one and he
starts creating pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: She creates pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been sprayed for seven days
before I move it to the other room,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this situation, it's taken a minute for
my girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them isn't showing enough pistil,
so I'm hesitating on the pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a week or two weeks since
I've sprayed before the pollination even
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do the math here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say hypothetically,
I started spraying silver thiosulfate on
[SPEAKER_00]: December 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would have sprayed at the 1st,
3rd, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to the 21st day of December,
that plant would have gotten sprayed with
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 21 days of spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I honestly did not put the females
into flower until the 16th of December.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them two weeks advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave the male, the pollen donors,
a two-week head start to get building up
[SPEAKER_00]: their pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put the females into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have timed that about three or
five days different now that I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on, but I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were into flower 21 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they went to flower 16 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that five days in to the
flowering process of the females,
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped applying sprayed solutions to
the pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not receive pollen for probably
10, 12, 14 days after that, maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is going to be a three or four-week
time, I think, if I time that properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: or there's no sprayed application in the
room at all before those female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no overspray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those females will not be exposed to
silver thiosulfate in any way at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were, they're not going to get
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that is going to get smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in that room will be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all seeded material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that got sprayed, they're fully
pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get chopped and moved over to
the other room and fucking sprinkled all
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those plants are done donating their
pollen everywhere, they get cut into small
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces, put into a compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boy plants or the female pollen
donors, they're removed from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even a thought anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those female plants, they've received
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that's going to get smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all loaded with seeds, if I do it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing smokable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no overspray and there's been
a lot long time gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no concern for chemical,
what's the word you're using, chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: methods transferable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chemical transference to nearby plants
by air and to what extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea, but I think you're over
thinking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a time gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 21 is when I quit spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day five of when I put the other
girls into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get pollen in for 20
days from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice period from when the pollen
has been flying to, or from when the
[SPEAKER_00]: silver has been flying to when the pollen
flies and a big space in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I rambled about that one for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Atlean415,
