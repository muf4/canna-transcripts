[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can look forward to more shows
with guests because Hosting a show with 20
[SPEAKER_00]: people if I can do that There's definitely
no problem hosting a show trying to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation one-on-one with another
fellow grower fellow breeder Maybe a light
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get you on the show brother
Look forward to that coming up real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I'm going to do shows with more
people I'm gonna push the mic away from my
[SPEAKER_00]: face and clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for one moment while the music
plays You deserve better than that from me
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna blame the the raspy throat on a
product here from green dot labs called
[SPEAKER_00]: The rapture this is a live batter from
green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show it to the camera here It
may not focus real well because the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: is far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful golden batter Anyway,
my throat sounds raspy because I took a
[SPEAKER_00]: big fat dab of rapture live batter from
green dot labs This is a blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: headbanger and Han Solo burger on the
package It is described as the flavor is
[SPEAKER_00]: described as sour diesel and complex
grapes on the potency label It says
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy three point zero eight percent THC
non-detectable amounts of C BD the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about it is because it got me
lit and my voice is all funky from it But
[SPEAKER_00]: this concentrate is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it tastes like grape bubblegum and gas
and then it's got Afternotes of like real
[SPEAKER_00]: floral flowers and that complex grape
thing is a good description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that grape bubblegum You know
when you put grape gum in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, that's definitely grape gum
but then after you would if you gave it a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple choose it would turn into fuel and
then berries and some sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Wildflowers or something a little bit of
lilacs, but I'm not a fan of lilacs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like this flavor But it reminds me
of the good part of lilacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get off on a ramble here The reason
I don't like lilacs and lavender as well
[SPEAKER_00]: when I smell it I can feel it in my nose
Maybe that's another one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: synesthesia kind of things I've got going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just straight-up crazy But
anyway when I smell lilacs and lavender,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it in my nose This has that aroma
the wildflowers lilacs lavenders
[SPEAKER_00]: honeysuckles, but it doesn't bother my
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it to be pleasant Obviously gummy
high as giraffe pussy nice and rambly
[SPEAKER_00]: great product from our friends at green
dot labs They do not sponsor me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me Shout out to our
friends at Colorado cannabis exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: taking good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I picked these up I shouldn't
have said that you're all gonna go there
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy it now and they won't have it when
I want it But I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the store and I love the green dot
product So shout out to everybody for
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping me high once again Colorado
cannabis exchange hooks me up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take good care of me I get a friends
and family sort of thing over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nobody really pays me to advertise
this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was Fucking amazing and
tastes real good and got me to lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk about it Welcome to
Rasta Jeff's world a little bit of you
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let me get myself back on track
I'm stoned and talking about random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where was I gonna go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful day today you guys
Speaking of being out at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting products and driving around
and checking out the sneaker shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the grow store I did all those
things and it was a beautiful beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: day today What that meat leads me to say
is let's get prepared for the warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season indoor grow season as About
to change a lot of people have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: different gear for the indoors as the they
do the outdoors I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoors it got negative 17 degrees
here in the winter and the summer It's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a hundred and four a hundred
and six ish degrees here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not consistently but it will hit that
I've got to be prepared for those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to adjust my grow I turn
blowers around I uninstall and reinstall
[SPEAKER_00]: an air conditioner at certain times of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one blower I use different gear at
different times of the year So what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting at is it's time for you It's time
for us for the community for the ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: growers growing indoors to start getting
our equipment in line because the time is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming soon We're going to need an air
conditioner in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need a dehumidifier
Possibly we may need more fans We're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to need something to battle that warm
summer sun, especially here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're in Arizona Maybe you're in
someplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get a lot of drastic swings But
a lot of us are gonna have to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull out the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a window unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure you've got all the stuff
to put that air conditioner in the window
[SPEAKER_00]: to fucking seal it support it get it in
there safely and securely Also,
[SPEAKER_00]: have you cleaned it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean that thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be funky Let's take it apart if you
know what you're doing night Not everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: is reliable at pulling apart an air
conditioner But you can clean the main
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it if you take off the back cover
front cover Clean that bad bitch up get
[SPEAKER_00]: all the grime and gunk out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's think about the dehumidifier
That thing gets dirty if you lift up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of dehumidifier
you've got if you Lift up the tank and
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath that there's a little thing
that it's probably really dirty somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in that dehumidifier or your humidifier
There are some nasty mold funky Just
[SPEAKER_00]: disgusting this building up that you
haven't discovered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it apart clean the shit out of it
disinfect it and sanitize it Let's set
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves up for success for the upcoming
growth season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go in this winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have our armor tight Let's have the
car gassed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have the weapons loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overload your weapons They'll jam
but let's get in there prepared and ready
[SPEAKER_00]: To go to battle for this grow season and
let's win.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we win.
[SPEAKER_00]: We prepare now set ourselves up for
success So we got the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the dehumidifier cleaned up
Also, are you gonna switch from HPS lights
[SPEAKER_00]: to LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be something I do now in the
winter I may rely on those HPS lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my grow room safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up and switched eight to LEDs in
the winter My grow was mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up I made a mistake there's a bad
idea now the plants are great now that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not fucking ass cheeks cold outside
Now that it's not negative 17 degrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can keep the room nice the plants look
really good But it was a bad idea to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs in there in the winter I should
have kept the the HPS lights up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter put the LEDs in in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my new routine That's what I will
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you gonna have to switch get
it prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get back on track fans fans is
where I was headed with this clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans are you gonna have to hang up a bunch
of fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to put up new fans clean them
Take the the little shroud thing off the
[SPEAKER_00]: piece that make sure your dreadlocks don't
get caught in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that off Clean that it's probably got
a bunch of grime and dust on it Clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan blade take the fan blades off and
scrub it with the brush and clean both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of it Get it clean just a little bit
of dust and debris stuck on that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: will really Lessen the efficiency of that
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still paying for the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not getting the efficiency You're
wasting money right there your grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: watt your grams per dollar are going down
rapidly So let's clean the fan while
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the fan blades off clean that
back shroud and then also take a rag or a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper Towel and clean the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where all the muck and the
grime is don't be fucking lazy Don't skip
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gonna skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are What if I show up in
the grill?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I come to your town one day?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I'm just cruising?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some good green dot dabs I got a rig
with me and I just post on social media
[SPEAKER_00]: who wants to take a dab I'm in this town
and you're like, holy shit He's in our
[SPEAKER_00]: town and you invite me over and I take a
dab and I'm like So what kind of grow you
[SPEAKER_00]: got and we walk in there and there's like
cobwebs hanging from your fan Your air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner is blowing out mold and
fucking stank smell Act like I'm coming
[SPEAKER_00]: over or act like somebody that you don't
want to see the funk is coming over clean
[SPEAKER_00]: it up Make it look good polish that shit
up set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I've talked enough about the
preparing our indoor season for the warm
[SPEAKER_00]: season get the gear ready You don't want a
hot day to happen and you have to go I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to the air conditioner store and buy
an air conditioner and then install it
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow You're already two days behind
schedule at that point You should have
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucker installed tested ready to go
on a timer when it got too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have came back I'm not you
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my plants look angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the grower You're in charge be
responsible go get that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go get your gear ahead of time Learn
how to use it test it make sure it works
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to you don't want to have a
gunfight and have to drive to the gun
[SPEAKER_00]: store to get the gun You want the gun on
the table and the gun fight start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go get some guns get prepared I
don't know what's with all the gun
[SPEAKER_00]: references today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, um, get your shit prepared now
also you who you know who else needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: get prepared is the outdoor grower Is if
you don't have some clones ready some
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed sprouted or something
prepared for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are running out of time Let's get that
shit ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about being patient enough to
put it outdoors now You're becoming almost
[SPEAKER_00]: too late to put it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really fine line in here out
here in Colorado So get your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared that is going to lead me into
another really good rant But I need a sip
[SPEAKER_00]: of this little magic juice before I keep
going
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most delicious stuff on the
planet sometimes sometimes that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite That is a pineapple and coconut
nectar into one juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Cascadian grown It's
on a live video one night and he reached
[SPEAKER_00]: over and grabbed a bottle and took a big
old drink of it And I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, that stuff is magic and he just
smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, it's the best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tasty I shouldn't have talked about
that cuz now you're all gonna go buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: at the store, too And it won't be there
when I want it I went to the store today
[SPEAKER_00]: to get soil you guys and I had to buy some
random off-brand soil because they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything Familiar today at the grow
store at two different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have any Brand that I've ever
heard of I bought some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in the car I gotta wait for the
Sun to go down and bring it in when the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors aren't looking but you know how
it goes I'll tell you how it goes once I
[SPEAKER_00]: try it out and let you know what I think
but Shit shit's unlimited supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track I'm high as
giraffe pussy and we're we're rambling
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor season you guys it's time to get
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I See on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I troll social media quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to do just hanging out or pooping
or whatever I'm scrolling on social media
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what's going on and I see people
looking for Two and three packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking me what they're asking for
is a variety pack They're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey I see that you sell a six pack of fem
seeds But what I would like is two of this
[SPEAKER_00]: strain two of this strain and two of this
strain and I don't do that It would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very it'd be a very novel and wise
financial investment But there's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of reasons why I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain the first one as a business
person as a seed seller Somebody works
[SPEAKER_00]: with seed vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you why honestly If I sell you
two seeds and one of them doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate you've got a 50-50 germination
rate and I look like shit That's a bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not setting myself up for
success as a business person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a bad experience I could have
a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not a wise move We need better
numbers in the package to give better
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers are just killing seeds out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're new They don't know what they're
doing So I don't want you to kill one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two seeds and only buy two and then you're
shit out of luck and you blame me or I
[SPEAKER_00]: just that doesn't sound wise so then if
You kill one you got a 50-50 germination
[SPEAKER_00]: rate and I still look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let me talk about the real reason
For consumers and the consumer and why I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like to sell two of this and two of
this and two of this Not all two seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be exactly the same there's going
to be variation and The variation will be
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal in a pack of feminine seeds,
but it does exist and it's not deniable So
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend getting six of one strain and
growing all six of them and finding The
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper that is the best for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um It's like if you only had there's only
one girl in town to choose from you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna date her and have a family and be
satisfied but if there are six women in
[SPEAKER_00]: town one of them may be the one that you
really wanted to fall in love with and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't even have noticed the other one
if there's only one that may be a horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy to put it that way and I went
horrible I'm gonna try to accent that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the video, too But if you've got more to
select from you can find something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: better for you for your garden For your
grow environment for your grow space for
[SPEAKER_00]: your medical needs for your recreational
needs, maybe your financial needs However,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it if you've got more to
search from of one kind you may find
[SPEAKER_00]: something better So it's cool that you
want two of this two of this two of this
[SPEAKER_00]: but um Grow six seeds of one kind find the
winner out of that Then buy another six
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of something else and grow the six of
those and find the winner out of that find
[SPEAKER_00]: a get something with strawberry flavors
and find the strawberry you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: then get one With orange flavors and find
the orange you're looking for and just
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on one at a time would be as a
Professional grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I don't think I've ever said that
but I'm a professional grower is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced grower That's what I would
recommend find that one six pack grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those and I understand you want variety
You need to get it going but don't be in
[SPEAKER_00]: such a rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time Take your time and find
that one keeper find that beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking star out of the pack and then do
it again And now we you know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for you know that because we're
always as a seed breeder Is a somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to grow from seed we're always
thinking it's like a pack of baseball
[SPEAKER_00]: cards Does that pack of baseball cards
have that Mickey Mantle in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know if you find that Mickey
Mantle rookie card until you plant it grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it flower it out So finish the six pack
and start a new one That's why I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: sell two of this two of this two of this
so get a six pack Maybe a five pack of reg
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds maybe a ten pack of reg seeds and
actually do a fino hunt There will be
[SPEAKER_00]: variation you get to do your selection and
that way you can see the phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and Know what you're actually
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it just it's more fun You get to
dial it in you get to have what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like and what if I just said hey your
dinners coming you're like, what do I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whatever shows up and
whatever if I was like, hey you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose from Italian food Mexican food
Chinese food Thai food Indian food you get
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a pick you're gonna be much
happier with those kind of options instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of just whatever Rasta Jeff sent you
because I'm fucking mostly vegan and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people already are going fuck I don't
want to eat his meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, give yourself options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also We shouldn't be running untested
stuff outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway People are buying feminized seeds
so that they can put two of this outside
[SPEAKER_00]: two of this outside and two of this
outside and Hopes for a successful harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna grow some weed outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna grow some fem seeds outdoors
but You should audition these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: before you put them outdoors in big pots
and hope for your summer crop On a big old
[SPEAKER_00]: plant when you don't even really know What
you've got you could have maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype you want if you're growing
from regular seed, maybe it's a male I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done a full episode about not Sexing your
plants before you put them outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: then growing a three foot tall or a three
foot wide six foot tall Male plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to cut down as soon as you realize
it's a boy Hopefully you realized it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: boy before you pollinated everybody's crop
within fucking five miles So you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be running untested stuff outdoors in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff should be tested indoors
verified a female Verified for the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not problematic Then run it outside
and if you insist on running a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors that has not been tested tried
true and verified Run a feminized seed
[SPEAKER_00]: from a reputable and reliable breeder I'm
not trying to say just buy seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegenetics, but that's what I would
recommend and prefer that is my brand Of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, I'm gonna boost my brand but get
feminized seeds from a reliable breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of places to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend seeds Here now comm of course,
but if you're going to grow outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: please use that fem seed But I totally
think you should be auditioning these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before you put them outside They
should at least be sex tested You should
[SPEAKER_00]: at least know you got a good phenotype
before you even think about putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside We're skipping the selection steps
and I get it a lot of people want to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: something outside and make some weed But
not only are you potentially wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially there comes that weird version
of that word again If you listen to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of episodes, you've heard me say
potentially I don't know where It came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the word is potentially anyway,
you're not only potentially messing up
[SPEAKER_00]: your own garden by planting Possibly
males, but you can mess up all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens for several miles around you
downwind There could be another garden
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen hits that travels over there
to that guy's plants to my plants my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants outside are now pollinated What if
a bird the bees you guys know about the
[SPEAKER_00]: birds and the bees landing on plants and
pollinating, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make that shit happen prevent that
so audition your plants before you put
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside I did say I was going to
focus on Some patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did write some down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see which one I want to do first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go Let's move over to
the patreon portion of this podcast This
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the show is brought to you by our
friend Kurt Z Big up to my buddy Kurt Z
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to give some sneaky patreon
shoutouts in there so I can get more
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon shoutouts off the list I do
promise to shout out people who contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: seven dollars and ten cents or more every
month But I can't do enough episodes to
[SPEAKER_00]: get all those Shoutouts into that many
episodes right now because I get so many
[SPEAKER_00]: shoutouts and so many paid patrons if you
haven't heard your name I apologize there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do a lot of content There
may be extra episodes coming up just to
[SPEAKER_00]: get these shoutouts that I promise you do
try to be a man of my word I try to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm highest giraffe pussy Let's stay
focused and answer these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Kurt Z This question
came from patreon and it comes from DZ
[SPEAKER_00]: from Detroit and this question goes a lot
Like this it says your rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running 18 and 6 and my off hours are
midnight to 6 a.m So what he means is the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are on 18 on and 6 hours off They
are off from midnight to 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is reasonable That's most people
sleep in hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense and now it says
I want to change it So my off hours are
[SPEAKER_00]: now 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: To 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people have changes in plans
changes in life now It's time to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the light Schedule it says how do I go
about doing this the plants are 3 to 4
[SPEAKER_00]: inches tall Can I just make the switch and
everything be alright now since these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are little tiny itty-bitty baby
plants and they're just in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage They're not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not root bound because they're
little they're not stressed out because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're little I'm going to assume At this
point, I would say just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: switch the lights You're not gonna harm
these plants at this stage of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna cause them any problems
at this stage They're 3 to 4 inches tall
[SPEAKER_00]: their brand New once they get older you
may want to be more gentle about this and
[SPEAKER_00]: flower you would definitely do it
differently Let's talk about how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do this in flower I've done a full episode
about this and somebody asked a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: question, but let me just recap in Flower
the plants need at least that 12 hour on
[SPEAKER_00]: an uninterrupted dark cycle So if you
choose to change the timer in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you would have to do is unplug the
timer Let the 12 hour night cycle run
[SPEAKER_00]: through then at the new time that you want
those lights to come on That's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: would plug it on but after the full 12
hour went through So then you'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait like another if you want it to come
on six hours difference You'd have to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: that next six hours or however many hours
then just plug it on But as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it the full 12 hour sleep then go
back on you'd be okay But make sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets 12 hours Sometimes you got to go like
24 hours to get it back on cycle 36 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: until you catch the next time which you
want to actually start your new 12 12 But
[SPEAKER_00]: it's better to give it long extended dark
than it is to enter Interrupt the dark is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't like being uninterrupted in our
sleep, but we're okay to take a nap Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you take so many dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's 420 You dabbed all day trying
to do some videos and you end up just
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's acceptable But don't wake me up I'm
gonna be mad about that if you wake me up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of the night So naps are
cool, but waking me up in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the night is not cool in flower That's a
great way to remember that so um,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, you could just go for it My answer
was in veg you can play with the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go for it That is the short
version of that answer I should have just
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck with that here on the show But I
hope I answered your question my friend if
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else out there is thinking about
changing the light cycle while you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg and veg You're completely safe and
flower However, you do have to wait that
[SPEAKER_00]: full 12 hour sleep cycle then get it back
on the rhythm All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question comes from richo relaxo
and it said you can say my name my name is
[SPEAKER_00]: richo relaxo my question is I'm going from
the veg to Flower transition so he's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking to switch the lights to
flower Is it recommended to induce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce veg from a 24-hour light
schedule Which I'm currently on to a semi
[SPEAKER_00]: veg dark schedule before I switch to a
full-on flower schedule And my short
[SPEAKER_00]: answer to our friend was I would just
switch those bitches to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants have never seen dark
They've been on 24 hours of light since
[SPEAKER_00]: their birth basically since they've been
cut as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never seen dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know What dark is it's not
gonna take a lot of darkness for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: go Oh, yeah, and they're gonna trigger
into flower super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are gonna transition into
flower really quickly Sometimes it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 14 days to see the plant switch I bet
you these are ready and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: start switching in like 10 days You'll
start seeing female or at least if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants You'll start seeing pre
flower male or female whatever sex they
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite quickly because they've never
gotten any dark and they're eager for it
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would just switch them from 24
Right over to that 12 12 and you will see
[SPEAKER_00]: them transition quite quickly Some people
do that 24 hour dark period if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, which might be your follow-up
question If you hear this that's
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable as well go from 24 hours on
give it a 24 hour dark period then hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that 12 12 They will go shebang kapow into
flower super quickly because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if they're big if they're
starting to show pre flower now if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: at all root bound They're gonna go into
flower super fast because of that Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: um You didn't ask this but I'm just gonna
interject this here because I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a it's what people rely on me for You
were on a 24 hour and zero sleep schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are not sleeping I highly
recommend a little bit of a sleep schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: every living thing wants a little bit of a
sleep schedule I would give it just four
[SPEAKER_00]: hours If you really don't want to you
don't have to and if if those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: in there with clones or something else I
get it but I would recommend four to five
[SPEAKER_00]: Hours of sleep everything will do better
with sleep a lot of the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: processes a lot of the root zone Processes
will happen in the dark time You'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: better shaped better growth healthier
happier plants If you just give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little time to take a nap everything in
nature is better with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep Then my backup to that question is
all of your equipment would benefit from a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of hours of rest Imagine not
running that light for four or five hours
[SPEAKER_00]: a day every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many lights you're running You
could save some electricity when that
[SPEAKER_00]: lights not running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the AC When they lights not
running you might need might not need that
[SPEAKER_00]: other fan when the lights not running You
might not need that exhaust You might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to turn off a whole bunch of shit for
like four hours and save a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money So just an idea just a
recommendation just a thing that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do if it were my grow All of my commercial
grows get four or five hours of sleep time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the veg room Even in the mother area a
lot of times the moms and the veg plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the same room That's why I keep
them on the 20 and 4 so that none of those
[SPEAKER_00]: moms will try to flower on me early Try to
keep those genetics around they get tricky
[SPEAKER_00]: if you give them too much sleep time,
but four hours is enough Let's them take
[SPEAKER_00]: some like two hours to fall asleep anyway
in an indoor environment without the far
[SPEAKER_00]: red So give them some sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your equipment will benefit from
it I think your plants will enjoy it the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone will enjoy it your wallet will
probably enjoy it But with that being said
[SPEAKER_00]: it's your grow my friend you do what makes
you happy in your grow job Love big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my buddy rich over laxo for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that Let's see.
