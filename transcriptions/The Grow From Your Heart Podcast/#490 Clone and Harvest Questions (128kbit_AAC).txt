[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 490 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of sour
animal live batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs, this is a blend of sour
diesel and animal cookies BX3.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as animal
crackers, fuel, and lemon cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really get the lemon cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I for sure get the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a sweetness, kind of a frosting
flavor that I will say could be animal
[SPEAKER_00]: crackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I certainly did get from
this concentrate is stoned as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my eyes are nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm kind of lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body feels nice and chill, nice and
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am ready for a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
this product contains 61.43% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approve of the sour animal live
batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read an
email that came from one of my Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get to the message,
let's do some shout-outs to a few of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout-out to Oki Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout-out to JM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big thank you shout-out to
Fat Rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart
fist bump to Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want to send a giant thank
you to Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to send a giant thank you to
James Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to send a big thank you high five
to Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I always want to send a fist
bump to Baked, PWN, and last, but
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not least, I want to send a big
Grow From Your Heart podcast high five,
[SPEAKER_00]: A fist bump and a thank you to my buddy
Dick Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody who supports the

[SPEAKER_00]: I will also include that Patreon link and
the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we have got all of the business
out of the way, let's jump right into this
[SPEAKER_00]: message that came from our buddy Dan Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for listening way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, your podcast has given me a
great education to make my next grow even
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly my goal is to help you
improve your garden and understand your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are both reaching our goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations and thanks for the
compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, My question is I'm
going to harvest my plants in about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was my first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds look great like lollipops,
but some others are more the popcorn type.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best way to harvest these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need to stay attached to a branch
and hung up to dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can some of these smaller buds dry
sitting in a bowl?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read my name, but it's fake as we
are in prohibition here in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, dude, from dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my new friend, dude Dank with a fake
name over there in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Patreon support and
thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about hanging or
drying these little popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that some of your buds are
lollipop type.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me think that you at least
attempted to clean up the lower parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and you were mostly successful
and you were able to get most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy up to the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you've got a good grasp
on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you did not lollipop sufficiently
and you've got some little popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it larf in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's little larfy buds, just little
popcorn nuggets, just little lowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably could have been pinched off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That energy possibly could have gone up
higher into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we are at harvest and we've got
some of these little popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds do not have to stay on a stick
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get put into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get put onto a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes growers use those tiered racks
that hang from the ceiling or they hang
[SPEAKER_00]: from something and it's a cylinder type
thing with multiple shelves in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing to think about is not
letting these buds get pressed together or
[SPEAKER_00]: get too tightly squished so that you start
getting any sort of a mold or a funky
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma or any problems like that from the
buds being pressed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want plenty of airflow while they dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on the density of these
little buds, you may want to spread them
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not want to put them in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to put them flatter on
something like a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're fluffy, if they're really
airy, a bowl shouldn't cause you any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give them a stir every few hours
just to make sure that none of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting moldy, getting funky,
getting too compressed on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that all depends on how much of
this little popcorn bud you've got and the
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not need to stay on the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really convenient just to chop it
all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe trim it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use it for smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use it to make
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to make edibles out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide what you want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not even going to smoke it,
you don't have to bother trimming that
[SPEAKER_00]: little stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, cannabis is abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that is not the size of... I've
got big thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's not the size of most
people's thumb gets tossed into what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the hash pile, and we make
concentrates out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not going to smoke it as
flour, don't bother trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to take the time to take
the leaves off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to turn it into edibles or
a concentrate or make topicals out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it is going to be consumed any other
way than by smoking it, don't bother
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming it because it is just going to be
a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is yes, it should be
safe to put those little popcorn buds on a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray or in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend something flatter and
whiter so they're not stacked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're a little drier, you can start
bowling it, stacking it up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: consolidating, saving some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's fresh and wet, I may not stack
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may leave it nice and wide and spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take too long for it to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if it's just popcorn buds,
it should dry up quickly enough to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just gather it up into a bowl and
then you can handle it that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you had intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it all depends on the size and
density of those buds and how long it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes them to dry, how much moisture is in
those buds at the time of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people water their plants up till the
day of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks will water if they're going to
chop down tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will still water today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will stop watering a few days
before harvest to kind of speed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying cure process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you're going to do great
because you were smart enough to ask this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on your first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are comfortable with it,
I would love to see some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really look forward to seeing
how we can improve your garden next time
[SPEAKER_00]: through just one cycle of practice,
one cycle of trial and error, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a few more episodes of the show under
your belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got some confidence now
that you've got one successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really look forward to seeing how you
improve in your next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck with the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this harvest cycle goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you dry and cure it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please listen to the dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got any questions about the
dry and cure or about your next cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: please send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my new buddy,
Dude Dank UK from over there in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to work on some listener
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came straight to the
growfromyourheartathotmail.com email
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is, we're going to skip the name
because I'm not sure if they want me to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that, but the message goes just like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father-in-law-to-be passed during a
heart valve replacement just two months
[SPEAKER_00]: before my upcoming wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say he had a way
with any and all plants, a true Mr. Green
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb, and he was growing some cannabis
outdoors, tucked into his garden bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: to gift out to his friends after the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't even smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just loves this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wonderful and terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you lost a wonderful
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a sad tale, but it is
taking a very interesting twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is almost like a Hollywood movie that
I would go watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Obviously, we have taken on the
task of finishing this round and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping them indoors to finish flowering
as they have vastly outgrown my tent
[SPEAKER_00]: limits and they're doing amazingly with
the organic soil additives which I have
[SPEAKER_00]: been adding, as well as worm castings from
our personal worm composting bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep the memory of this amazing man
alive, I am attempting to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics going by cloning these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very minimal experience with
growing, but I have never attempted
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about where we
are so far on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person was getting married and their
fiance's father-in-law passed during a
[SPEAKER_00]: heart valve replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man who passed was growing cannabis
in his outdoor garden to share with his
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This man's daughter and new son-in-law
have taken it upon themselves to rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant, not only for the sake of the
cannabis plant, to preserve the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve its genetics, but also to
preserve the past man's reputation because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody knew he was growing and it would
have made him look bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got the plant the fuck out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are attempting to clone this
plant to preserve the father's genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: to preserve his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's catch up into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, When we saved them, they were
already showing preflowers, so I cut
[SPEAKER_00]: clones ASAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used sterile blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow your method as described in the
podcast, dipped into rooting hormones and
[SPEAKER_00]: placed the cuttings into root riot cubes
that I soaked in distilled water and then
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezed the excess water out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased all necessities for a tent
setup and got the clones a seven inch dome
[SPEAKER_00]: under my LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a seedling mat running due to
the fact that it's in my basement in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold, New York concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tray is off the ground with the mat
just below providing minimal heat instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of direct contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the plants were starting to
show preflowers, so they decided to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got great success rate from clones
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They purchased all of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used sterile blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They followed my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dipped the clones into rooting
hormones and placed them into root riot
[SPEAKER_00]: cubes that were soaked in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, the distilled water is the only
part that's got me concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about the LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat mat, we may want a little bit
more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the temperature in there,
but if it's a cold New York basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may want that heat directly under those
clones just to give them a little oomph.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't have a thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you exactly how cold it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the message though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, it has been about four
weeks and I still do not have roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are beginning to turn slightly
yellow, but everything else looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity is kept high between 75 and
90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dome is constantly sweating and I
spray the inside of the dome down with
[SPEAKER_00]: water, pHed around 6 to 6.5 when it dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have gone a little lower on the pH
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have gotten closer to 6 and not as
close to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity, I think you're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the temperature is kept between 70
and 80 between day and night and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights set on an 18-6 time schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have gone just a touch warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have gone closer to 75 to 85 and I
would have gone 24 hours a day of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never have given them any dark
time until I saw roots, probably until I
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was your first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a great job trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the lights are placed
about 26 inches above the top of the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have gone much closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost, let's see, I'm going to read
about your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a multi-spectrum LED,
600 watt equivalent with only the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum activated at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I am not using any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your light may be correctly the correct
distance since you're using an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were a T5, I'd go much closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like your LED may be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would do is put my hand right
at the top of the dome and feel the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your hand comfortable there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to move your hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to move your hand,
it is too warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just leave your hand there,
then that light is not cooking the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does say I am not using any
nutrients at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the distilled water and the rapid
rooters and the lack of nutrients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.6 light schedule and probably a little
bit of cold, I'm going to say those things
[SPEAKER_00]: are what added up to a lack of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, could this
slow root growth be due to the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants were in flower when cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think that has anything to
do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times some growers like to take
their cuts from plants which are in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and then revert those to veg because it
does make really monstrous clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, are my lights too close?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not familiar with your particular
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got the right idea
with it being 26 inches above the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got only the veg spectrum
activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, put your hand underneath
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it feels too warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're cooking them with the
light, but honestly, I am not familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with the LED and I'm not sure how strong
that 600 LED is for those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I'm reading, the message goes on
to say, is there anything else that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could see me doing incorrectly from this
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned before, I definitely
would have some nutrients in those rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: rooters and I would definitely be feeding
the plants some sort of feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were spraying the dome,
I would have some light nutrients in that
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were spraying the dome,
that is how the plants are going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any roots, so they're
relying on the leaves to catch that foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: feed and keep them alive until they do
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been very beneficial to
put some nutrients in that spray when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were misting the domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think a little bit of heat would
have helped you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then having it on a 24-hour light schedule
definitely would have helped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have encouraged roots to happen
much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, if it has been four weeks
since these clones were cut, I would start
[SPEAKER_00]: losing faith in them very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep anything around for four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't root by the third week,
it is goodbye in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that these plants are
special to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably worth another week of
trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add some nutrients to that foliar
feed that you're giving them when the dome
[SPEAKER_00]: dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may re-water those plugs with something
that's got a liquid beneficial bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a root inoculant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get some liquid great white,
maybe some mammoth pea just to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus into those clones and
encourage some root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mistake that a lot of new cloners make
is they try to keep those plugs way too
[SPEAKER_00]: wet for way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them an opportunity to kind of dry
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them dry and brittle,
but when they start to get dry is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are most likely to get roots popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a funny joke amongst growers that you
say, yeah, the best way to get my clones
[SPEAKER_00]: to root is to forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, ah, shit, I haven't checked on my
clones in like two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go look at them and they're
starting to get a little bit dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're finally starting to root like a
son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of dryness may help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, unfortunately, I feel like four
weeks has passed the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably starting to get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get a little bit of
mold or rot where they're stuck into the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably losing life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably game over for these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but it is probably too late to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know we really wanted to keep these
genetics around because these were plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from a very special person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He obviously had a good heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was growing cannabis in his garden
secretly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he secretly smokes too and we just
don't know that, but he says he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and he was passing out this herb to
his friends to be a good person,
[SPEAKER_00]: to share with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that makes me think is that this is
the kind of guy that has probably got some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds stashed somewhere amongst his
personal possessions, somewhere in this
[SPEAKER_00]: man's area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every old guy has an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's your workshop, if it's your chair,
if it's your stool, every old guy's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get older, our space gets smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our shit ends up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to go anywhere to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That old guy has probably got some good
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stashed away somewhere and I encourage you
to find those seeds and I hope you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow those seeds to honor your
father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is one more sentence to this
message and it says, if you need any
[SPEAKER_00]: further information or pictures,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much listening to your
grow lesson series of podcasts during
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the fucking man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like your father-in-law was the
fucking man too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I appreciate what you do and any
help you may be able to provide to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: these particularly special plant cycling
in our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sign it with much love and
then their name, I'm not sure if they want
[SPEAKER_00]: that said, they know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for this work that you did for
this plant also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came across a ganja plant that needed
rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a dog on the street and you
gave it shelter and you tried to pet it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you tried to feed it and try to love
it like it was your own little puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for stepping up and taking care
of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you bought all of the
equipment to take care of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering if you were still
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you continue to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to continue to grow?

father-in-law's stash?

garden.
