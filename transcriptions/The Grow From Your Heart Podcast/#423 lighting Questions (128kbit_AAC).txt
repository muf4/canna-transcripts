[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, smokers and growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 423 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to add fresh new genetics to
your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite Seeds, and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Mai Tai
live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Sunset Sherb and Purple
Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor description on the container
says it should taste like tropical fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: cocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says 69.27% total THC
and 0% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack this open, I start thinking
that I don't know if I know what a Mai Tai
[SPEAKER_00]: really smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a familiar aroma for me,
but as I give this a sniff, it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: a Long Island ice tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a tropical aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a very pungent aroma,
but that maybe a triple sec sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing definitely dominates the smell of
the Mai Tai.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is obviously quite potent because it
has got me talking my face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great podcast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the Mai Tai live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
that short episode I put out on Thursday
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the content I made before 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just needed a little bit of a podcasting
break, so I threw out a short episode for
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are Monday with a full length
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to read more listener emails in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs for our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to give a big shout out to
Miss Melville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a giant shout out to my friend
Tanner M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a huge Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to my friend Farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: John.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant shout out to my
friend Dick Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, always a shout out to Todd K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to my friend
Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast fist bump to my friend Remy
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for your support on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron, you can do so by going to Patreon
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to become

[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, I want to thank everybody
for all of the Patreon contributions,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who has helped out in the past,
in the present, and in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your support really does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know I said I was going to read
some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I've got one more
thing I would like to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several episodes back, before 420,
I started asking people to send in
[SPEAKER_00]: submissions and let me know what 420 means
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, many of you are cannabis
consumers, which means that 420 came and
[SPEAKER_00]: passed you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even realize it was 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you messaged me on 420 or right
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a submission I received on the
afternoon of 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what 420 means to a friend of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see or hear 420, I smile and I say
thank you for saving my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in constant pain from a pinched nerve
in my neck and three screwed up lower back
[SPEAKER_00]: discs plus a 15 millimeter by 22
millimeter crack in my left knee socket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had enough and wanted to get just high
for the fun of it and hoped it would get
[SPEAKER_00]: me numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting ready to leave and I'd
started giving my shit away to all my
[SPEAKER_00]: peoples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was done with all of my pains and being
angry all the time and I was stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was overweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at 365 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was mentally and emotionally
checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I asked my budtender what was good
for pain, sleep, or just help with stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the 18 year old kid would
recommend something that was just strong
[SPEAKER_00]: as hell, lots of THC and that would get me
high as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that's everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that's what everyone was talking
about when they said cannabis helped them
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were just getting high as a
kite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kid says something like try Romulan
or sleep pain for sleeper pain or Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper for daytime pain or OG Kush and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close to bedtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Romulan slept great.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time since 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis helped this guy sleep for the
first time since 97 because it is 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you feel if you hadn't had a nap
since fucking 1997?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you say I've been up for two days
or I didn't get any sleep last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude said he's been up since 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend smoked a little bit of
Romulan on the recommendation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: budtender and he got his first good night
sleep since 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say then I tried OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I got this stuff that really
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put the brakes on all that checking
out bullshit and started growing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't looked back at those dark days
until you asked me what does 420 mean to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short, it sounds like this guy was
done with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking to possibly take his own
life in the very near future if he hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered the proper strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: His pain, his discomfort, his attitude,
his health, his weight, everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: stacking up to where he was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had emotionally checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had checked out of his friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like he was giving a shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get to that point, you were close
to doing something ridiculous that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't undo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was about to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smoked the appropriate strain of
cannabis based on a budtender's
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation and he finally got some
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine getting some sleep since 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You finally get some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start being nicer to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your attitude is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're nicer to people, they're nicer
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a lot to do with your health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mental health, in my opinion,
will play a lot with how your body feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend consumed some cannabis and
basically it saved his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he is one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he is a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a smoker and he is an advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who this person is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does contribute to the podcast heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a shout out on a lot of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually says his name here in the
future in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to give him a shout out
here on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis has turned this person's life
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smoked just for the hell of it because
he was at wit's end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else was going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to go bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was already at the breaking point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked a little reefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made him feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave him some sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got to break free from his pain,
from his suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he is enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's one of us also.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's part of the Irish army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to continue with the message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, thank you so damn much
for all you do for the 420 community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to you, Rasta Jeff and the Irish
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for this great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Messages like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I didn't have anything to do with
your starting of consumption, but knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I am part of this movement,
that I'm helping people with their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, just being a part of this and
being able to read these types of stories
[SPEAKER_00]: on my little show here, that means a lot
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are going to hear this and
they're going to say, man, this guy was at
[SPEAKER_00]: wit's end and cannabis kind of turned him
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that story alone will change
somebody else's perspective on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a part of the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for supporting myself and the
show so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been a big part of the Irish
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are part of the Irish army as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reciprocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a listener, a guy doing a podcast
is just a weirdo with a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a good, solid audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works well for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to mention his social media
handles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also talks about some other things here
that we don't need to share on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, thanks for the shout outs every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels so damn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, sorry for this long ass
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an old fart grower and all of this is
new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gives me, it looks like a
cloud emoji.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't read what that emoji is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer printed it out kind of oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out for the fist bump right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is from our friend, Richard
Memel, also known as 420Gramsys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey Richard, thank you for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for telling me what 420 means to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very moving story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that changes somebody's outlook on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, that was kind of brave for you
to go out and share something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of opening up to the whole
world here, to the whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community, especially to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your bravery and I appreciate
this great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for telling me what 420 means to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not too late, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I asked several episodes ago,
what does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: GrowFromYourHeart at Hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it is short, you can send it to me
on Twitter at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to find them all and I
will read your submission on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody said, do you mean the number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean the date?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say 420, what does it mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's get into those emails
that I keep talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one right here at the top of the
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, let's see, it says no names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't say my name because I am in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an indoor garden going.
[SPEAKER_00]: First grow all auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a 20 on and four hour off light
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my plants are already a couple of
weeks into flower and some have just
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all seeded the same week,
but there are three different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they are going at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bred from different genetics,
so they are going to have different
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have different flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll finish at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about why in a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the weather where I live has
gotten really nice and I want to move my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to my back deck for a few hours
each day for their light cycle when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything I should know about
moving them in and out as far as temps and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, should I gradually let them adjust
to the sunlight or is it okay to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: them out there for 12 to 13 hours of
daylight in a row?
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up and he says I am a disabled
veteran and I am growing my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps with my anxiety and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for your service and I am
saddened that you have got PTSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am happy to hear that you have found
medicine that works for you because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that PTSD can be really torturous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you've got something helping
you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said the weather has gotten really nice
and I want to move my plants to my back
[SPEAKER_00]: deck for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, that sounds like a really great
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants would love some sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sunlight would be really good for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably also going to love that
outdoor air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be beautiful for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my biggest fear is that you are
going to bring bugs into the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: when you bring the plants back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how careful you are,
no matter what you do, I would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid that I would bring bugs from that
outside environment into my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spend a lot of time building a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of effort into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of effort into keeping it
isolated, to take those plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is against everything that I would do
in my grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably play by your own rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're a cannabis grower and a
cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not take these plants outside
because you may likely bring bugs in when
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs can fly and land on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs can climb up the pot and get right
into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs will climb up into the dirt,
then climb up the stick and hide under the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I had another friend who listens to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was having an issue with his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't figure out what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day he told me, well, when I took them
outside, they looked fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been bringing them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized he had some sort of soil borne
pest, something burrowed from the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of his pot up into the root zone,
up into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It infested the entire root zone of his
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took him a long time to recover from
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not suggest taking them
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got bugs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe possibly you've got neighbors
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your living situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't want anybody to see those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're a disabled veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody sees them, people are thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody might call the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't put them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say prohibition land and plants
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another big red flag for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't snitch on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a fucking Girl Scout cookie
sales girl coming by to sell you some Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies and see your weed plant out
on the back deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be out in the middle of the woods
where nobody's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't take those plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to do that because you're a
grown ass man and you can do whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do choose to take these plants
outside, let me give you some advice that
[SPEAKER_00]: can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not take them out there and leave
them in the sun for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely introduce them slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take them out when the sun comes
up for a couple of hours, maybe an hour or
[SPEAKER_00]: two and watch them, see how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start getting weird, take them
back in, put them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them back under their normal grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe the next day, put them out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went an hour the first day,
maybe go two hours the next day,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe go three hours the next day,
slowly increase the outdoor interval and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay very close attention
because if they start acting weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get them back indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you put them out there for 12
hours underneath that natural light,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that may be a little more than
what they were ever used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be like if I just kept you in a
dark basement for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one Friday night I picked you up
and took you to see the Pink Floyd light
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes would blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't be able to handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants will kind of feel the
same way if we go put them under the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight for too long right away without
any protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got kind of a shadier spot to
put them in at first and then move them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the sun, that also may be a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not look like you're getting a lot
of light out there in a shadier spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you are absolutely getting enough rays
from the sun for it to affect that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison to what you were getting
indoor under a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shadier spot outside is probably more
efficient light than the grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, even if it's shady because it is
the exact spectrum of light that your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to dim the sun too much,
even with a whole bunch of clouds,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in a shady spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe start that plant in a shadier
area on your deck and then move it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight as the day goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pay very close attention to your
plants that those plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that all three are going to
enjoy the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you've got three different
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get different responses from these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much this will apply to
your plants, but those plants have never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know that there is sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may introduce them to the idea that
there is a light outside much greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: they have ever experienced inside that
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, they are growing because they
are adjusted to the amount of light that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're meeting their DLE because of the
amount of light that they are getting from
the sun.
They're not going to see the sun.
They're going to see the sun.
They're going to see the sun.
They're going to see the sun.
They're going to see the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take them outside, they may get
used to having more intense light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring them back indoors and put
them under your grow light, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be enough light to stimulate the
photosynthesis that they were receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may begin to stretch ridiculously
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be genetic dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that could be a thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like introducing somebody to ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who has only eaten just a plain
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have breakfast, lunch and dinner
and no snacks, nothing sweet, nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kind of personal treats for their mouth
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day you take them out to some
fancy place and you give them just pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like, holy shit,
ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never going to be satisfied with
basic breakfast, lunch and dinner anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because you introduce them to ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cool before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know ice cream was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're like, bro, ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some of that shit because you
introduced it to their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe the plants will react
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, hey, I was used to getting
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep stretching for it
because I know that it is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take them indoors,
that may backfire on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would completely not take these
plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're risking bug problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're also risking snitches and
thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my next suggestion is if you're going
to take them out there, if you insist on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it, I would leave them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take them out and bring them back in
because then you're going to contaminate
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that the light cycle is
probably not appropriate at this time for
[SPEAKER_00]: your auto flower plants to go outside to
continue their flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be the best case scenario
would just be take them outside and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: them to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that is probably not an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you want to bring them back in
and put them in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scares me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of time and effort into these
grow rooms and to take plants outside just
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them a little bit of sunlight and
bring them back in and then bring the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really makes me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a commercial cultivator, I've got a lot
at stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one bug can become a problem very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your medicine that you're relying
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's helping with your PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't risk it, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just keep those plants in the grow
room and keep them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said before, you're an adult
and you can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to do what makes you happy
because I know there's nothing like taking
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant out on the back deck,
watching the birds fly around and the
[SPEAKER_00]: squirrels run around and smoking a fat
joint, maybe taking a couple of pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how good that's going to
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do that, feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make yourself happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just understand the risks while you were
doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to thank you for a great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a lot of great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very useful information for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one more sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you know anywhere that has
feminized lemon Jeffrey seeds in stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a great strain,
but I can't find it in stock online
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all of your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will send a pics when they finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again from prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really look forward to those photos when
they are finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now about the lemon Jeffrey, feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any lemon Jeffrey,
feminized seeds for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they are in stock
anywhere at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything goes according to plan,
there should be lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds available at Oregon elite
seeds around the beginning or middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: July.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the earliest I can promise those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This breeding batch was very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very limited on our numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this batch was a very small batch,
but around the middle or beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: July, there will be very few packs of
lemon Jeffrey, feminized seeds available
[SPEAKER_00]: at Oregon elite seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat just did a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take like seven fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and then I'll be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as promised, I took way too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good drink and now I am back
heavily medicated, well hydrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ready for a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great email in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ross, Jeff, I am in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no names.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use this on the show, Hey,
that's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I just wanted to say
that I really enjoy your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have listened to all of the grow shows
and I am very appreciative of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information and the help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me just to know that
I'm helping somebody makes it worth all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this is my first grow and I am
doing auto flowers under led lighting that
[SPEAKER_00]: I got from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants are about two weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not positive because they are
autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just not really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most are about a foot tall and they have
really exploded in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did use some LST and I have lots of
exposed bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said he's done some low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what he's done,
but he's done a little bit of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants aren't very big, but they're
taking off now that they are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably had them long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've reached their age where the
hormones have developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have triggered themselves into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in this email, everything seems
okay, but there is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, my question is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been using two kinds of cheaper
leds, which I got from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to your podcast,
I have decided to do a veg and flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cheaper leds are going to veg
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my new HLG 600 H led should be here
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's ordered a horticultural lighting
group, 600 H led.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time we're reading this message
on the show, it has arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he's got it hung up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'm not too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I have still got some useful
information for you in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your HLG 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say this light is supposed to replace
a 1000 watt DE, which means a double ended
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the par of my current lights,
but I know what the par of the HLG 600 are
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recommend to put the light 24 to
30 inches from the canopy because the par
[SPEAKER_00]: is so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously don't want to screw anything
up since I am so far along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any suggestions on height to start at the
new lights and what to look for if the new
[SPEAKER_00]: light was to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate everything you have
helped me with so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the grow podcast coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise to keep the grow lessons coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on this new grow light
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably already got the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably already hung up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably already got the plants
underneath there and you were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: already doing a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you were thinking and you
know that you need to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably paid close attention to
the plants and you saw how they reacted
[SPEAKER_00]: and you adjusted accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what I would have
recommended had I read this email before
[SPEAKER_00]: you got your light delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume and hope that your new
light is quite a bit more powerful than
[SPEAKER_00]: your old light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are absolutely correct in thinking
that you may need to hang that light a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher than the previous light
was hung.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the light that was in there before
was, let's say, 16, 18 inches above the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, this one you're going to want to
start off maybe 24, maybe 30 inches away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that they recommend 24 to 30
inches from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start off at least that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the light at full power and pay close
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I should recommend you
make sure to do is to keep this light on
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same cycle with your old light
was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a flowering phase,
stay at that flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that light cycle the same so that you
don't disrupt anything, so that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have multiple variables to mess up our
experiment, so that we can see what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening from the new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang up the new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a thermometer and a hygrometer in
this environment so we can see if that new
[SPEAKER_00]: light is heating up the room or if it is
drying out the room or causing excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a new light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pay attention to what happens
in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to pay close attention to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked what we could watch for for
these plants to see if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to pay attention to the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get too hot, they will start to
make what I call taco leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, the leaves should be basically
flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start to curl up, you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see a taco leaf, you'll go,
oh, that's what he meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to make like a canoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle of the leaf goes a little
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outer edges come up higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaf, you could almost pour water in
there and it would sit right inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a taco or a canoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sign of too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were getting that, you've got too
much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your thermometer and that
indicator right there on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your temperature on the plants to
see if the heat has increased to a level
[SPEAKER_00]: that has made that plant uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you need to lower the heat in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is obviously the solution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing we want to focus on after
worrying about the heat is do we have too
[SPEAKER_00]: much light on our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we just increase the light to a level
that makes them uncomfortable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on the leaves of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they start drooping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they start pointing straight up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are indicators of how happy your
plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves begin to droop throughout
your cycle, That means they have reached
[SPEAKER_00]: their daily light integral and they simply
can't take any more light and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: put themselves to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see those leaves just start to
droop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nap time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start doing their
nighttime stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had enough for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to reduce your light cycle
if you see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to reduce it by an hour or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your light is intense enough,
if your new light is giving off enough
[SPEAKER_00]: increased intensity, your plants may be
reaching their daily light integral
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier than they did before because
they're receiving so much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts to droop, maybe an hour
before you're used to, that is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to bed a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an indicator that you may be able
to adjust that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an auto flower grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know enough about auto flowers to
know if you should adjust your light to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you will answer your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person I think of when I say auto
flowers, is Mephisto Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is who I would recommend and suggest
and all things auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take your auto flower questions to
Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be able to give you more details on
that, but let's talk about this light
[SPEAKER_00]: because I do understand this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you're going to see is
leaves drooping or leaves pointing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start drooping way early,
that means that you are giving it too much
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like within an hour of putting the
light above those plants, they should not
[SPEAKER_00]: droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see them droop, that means they're
getting too much light and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a couple of days, if your leaves
begin to twist, that means they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: too much light and they're pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much light is kind of a rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that you can do it with an
indoor light setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going from an LED to an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants should be excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put that light up there and pay
attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang it as high as you can get it within
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off, it says 25, let's see,
it says 24 to 30 inches above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it for two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if everything is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower it six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it for a couple of hours like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that knows those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to see how they are
reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been working with these plants for
their entire veg phase plus two weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a good idea of what these
plants look like in the morning when they
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should know what these plants look
like in the mid afternoon when you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should know what the plants look
like when it is almost bedtime when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: the before bed check on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep those things in mind and compare
that to how the plant is reacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: this new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main things you're going to watch for
is the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the leaves drooping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they falling off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the plants look sad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look over water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it start to curl downward or upward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are signs of too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the whole tip top of the plant
starts bending over, it is trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely need to raise the light or
reduce the power at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think since you're going from LED to an
improved LED, your plants are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things you need to pay close attention
to are the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to think about is the VPD
in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you changed the VPD by changing the
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you are getting a whole different
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a different humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are getting a lot of different changes
that you're going to re need to dial that
[SPEAKER_00]: room in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to readjust all of your climate
controls if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is grab those
plants and see what they feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the leaf surface temperature in
your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the plants feel cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they feel too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the plants physically sweating?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are sweating, they're too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them touching in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can tell by looking at the plants
how they are liking or hating this new
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are drooping, if they look angry,
they obviously don't like the new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If over a couple of days, the leaves start
to twist and curl, they absolutely do not
[SPEAKER_00]: like this new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, like I said before, since you
went from an LED to an upgraded LED,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants should be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start out about 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop it down to the 30 mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go to 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see any adverse reactions,
maybe go a little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how low you want to go with
the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a distance where you kind of,
it becomes a point of diminishing returns
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get your plants too close to the
bulb because that super intense coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the blight bulb there isn't even usable
by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to back it up to make it usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best way to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing what I call they get
their nails done, just the tips of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves start to look like shit,
that is a good sign that you are giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what will happen if you continue to
develop buds, the buds will get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those tips of the buds will start to
bleach themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that in a few magazines when it
just looks like a little white tip on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the bud or the top of the bud is
just bleached.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is from the plant being exposed to
too much light during the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply bleached the chlorophyll out of
the plant and that can absolutely happen
[SPEAKER_00]: with your LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to have a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at this light right now on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high quality light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, HLG, if I can get you to send me one
of these, what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: An HLG 600H.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would gladly replace one of my thousand
watt HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run it side by side and we can see
what your HLG 600 versus my current HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: setup does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to work with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just throwing out a shameless plug
through the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does look like a wonderful light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a quite pricey light, but it is
going to save you money in electricity and
[SPEAKER_00]: in cooling costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you are going to love this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on the great purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope this does a great upgrade
for your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just turbocharged your whole setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you had the forethought to ask this
question, I think you are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: right on top of paying attention to your
plants and knowing if they have gotten too
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you were already forethinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were prepared and you know what to
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you enough helpful advice to
where you don't burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
you have got this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hung up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are under there and it is
rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictures or it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you because you have inspired
me to research LED lighting just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between this message and all of the talk
about HLG lighting on the Dude Grow Show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to reach out to those folks and
see if we can't do some work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
my throat and my voice are done podcasting
[SPEAKER_00]: today, so I want to thank you for hanging
