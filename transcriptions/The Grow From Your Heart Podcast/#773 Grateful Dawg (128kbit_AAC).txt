[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far on this episode,
I do want to make a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have misspoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have gave some semi inaccurate
information on a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an update and a message from a
friend here who was paying a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more attention than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend used to be
cool and it politely says, I am only
[SPEAKER_00]: writing to say, I think you made a mistake
when discussing the Joe Biden pardoning
[SPEAKER_00]: people with federal convictions for simple
possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do understand where I went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for gently correcting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to be gently corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do always ask for questions,
corrections, comments, concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send those to me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this one says, I think you
made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched Biden make the announcement,
but I do not recall him saying anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about a release of prisoners, which is
what I misunderstood and where I misspoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says his announcement was to say that
he was pardoning people with federal
[SPEAKER_00]: convictions, convictions for possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the result of any pardon would be to
release anyone serving time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you pointed out and which Biden
would have already been aware,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one was serving time for simple
possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says a pardon acts to wipe out any
conviction as if it never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what Mr. Biden has
accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does do some different things for a
few people that may have affected more
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about that briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, while Mr. Biden may have been
fishing for votes, he still did the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I would urge you to correct the
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs it with his cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I appreciate these types of
updates, these types of corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I get stopped from saying
crazy stuff on here is if somebody does
[SPEAKER_00]: correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the correction and the
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about that real briefly
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dwell on old news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I misspoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that nobody was going to get
released from federal prison, which that
[SPEAKER_00]: is that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is some people are
going to be pardoned, which means their
[SPEAKER_00]: federal cannabis crimes will be wiped
away, which will help people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would this be beneficial to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on a lot of job applications,
it says, have you ever been convicted of a
[SPEAKER_00]: crime?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you don't have a federal
cannabis crime on your record,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably open to a lot more job
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably also open to a lot more
educational opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you apply for colleges, it says,
do you have any drug crimes right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, I got a federal cannabis crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They deleted that more opportunity for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this could give people the
opportunity for more loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people will be able to start their
own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing that this did is it
wiped a dent off of a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people got a fresh start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We erased some junk, some some cannabis
crimes that will help people out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will give people more opportunity,
which is what the world, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: states, need right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is more opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will be able to get more jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to get more loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to go to more schooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to better themselves and
make a better future for themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: not be stopped or blocked or have a hurdle
of a federal cannabis crime in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great update,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for keeping me on my toes and
keeping me straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, like I said before, don't be
shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear me say something silly,
something you don't agree with,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Jesse will send me a text
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be like, hey, bro, you should have
said 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said 24 or 18, six or 19, five or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to correct it and come on and
say, hey, I messed that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep me on my toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a show and sometimes I will
make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for keeping me on my toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do want to keep talking about some
things before we jump into the main topic
[SPEAKER_00]: of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to announce that, uh,
the blueberry butcher seeds will be back
[SPEAKER_00]: on irie direct for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry butcher seeds, then packaging
them up, getting them ready Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be on the website at irie direct
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that gets a pack of blueberry
butcher seeds while supplies last,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will come with a free pack of
platinum tangy cross to the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the catch you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need help naming the platinum tangy to
Jack the ripper cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a cool name for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys always have the greatest input,
the greatest feedback and advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we call platinum tangy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a platinum tangy female to a Jack the
ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that tangy candy goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some spicy dryer sheet sort of
aromas to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lots of lemon tangy aromas and a
really ripping soaring head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So help me out with the name to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, platinum tangy female pollinated by a
Jack the ripper male needs a cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also everything on irie direct does
get free packs with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough advertising here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great email that came from our
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he wants his name said or
not, or they want their name set or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but let's jump right into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to stare at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read it to the kind people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo, what's up rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just about to listen to episode five
90 and I'm super interested in testing of
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are interested in testing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of new things ready to be
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are contacting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've watched the tester episode,
watch that before you reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another requirement will be that you do
join the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were on the discord, you've got a
much greater chance of being qualified,
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted and approved as a tester because
I have everybody posting their tester logs
[SPEAKER_00]: on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can just go to one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go discord tester tab, scroll
through and see what everybody's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I start my mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some morning chores and I sit there
and my morning smoke is scrolling the
[SPEAKER_00]: testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, go watch the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still want to be a tester,
join the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a link in the show notes
in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'll get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I listen, I'm in NorCal in Shasta
County and I grow for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we don't need to read all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my main question right now is I
see that Ethos Genetics has a seed pack
[SPEAKER_00]: called Collin OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Ethos
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy Collin, the head
motherfucker in charge over there at Ethos
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I see Ethos Genetics has a seed
pack called Collin OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a strain called Collin OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, all of us breeders name a
strain after ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the lemon Jeffrey for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Jeff's OG that was really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll remake some more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, there is a Collin OG that is made
by the Ethos Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it's got Grateful Dog in it from
iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it absolutely does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this a collab on your part or did he
just buy a pack of your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much deeper than both of those,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he buy a pack of seeds then did the
breeding work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Made his packs and is giving you credit
after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything you do for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and respect your way from Lucas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend Lucas,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's okay that I said your name on
the show because too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to edit that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question is did he just buy a
pack of your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this a collab on your part or did he
just buy a pack of your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me unpack this a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the Grateful Dog from a... So I got
a pack of... A lot of people may not know
[SPEAKER_00]: this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gathering around and
turning up their AirPods to hear this one
[SPEAKER_00]: because people have been requesting and
asking for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of excited to deliver this
story right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within that bunch of seeds,
I got a pack of seeds called Deadhead OG
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Cali Connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, controversial company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel what you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think what you may.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the seeds came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opinions and feedback don't matter
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's straight up history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pack of Deadhead OG from the Cali
Connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several phenotypes that were
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of phenotypes that
were not fire in my opinion, but a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of more hot fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number nine was my favorite phenotype out
of that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the population, number nine was the
best looking plant in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a gassy... A funky gassy thing that
when you smelled it, your eyes kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: squinted like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it also had a earthy musky thing
that you went, oh, I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after, then I dried it and cured
it and smoked it and it had musky,
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy, skunky funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you exhaled it, a couple
seconds later, a berry thing would hit
[SPEAKER_00]: your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, well, now there's fucking
melons and berries in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it was really confusing,
complex, delicious weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Deadhead OG number nine is what
that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took Deadhead OG number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two clones of that plant because
you need two clones to do what I'm about
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put silver thiosulfate on one and
reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that female pollen on the other
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is there both number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Deadhead OG number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that came from there,
I selected one out of that one and I
[SPEAKER_00]: started calling that one grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I grew a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite keeper out of that,
I called it grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Deadhead OG, but I had selfed it
and made my own out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one became grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We later took, do I even want to tell this
part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I took that original pollen
and put it on my grateful dog and made
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that I called 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a grateful dead fan,
maybe I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 is just one of my favorite years of the
grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: 72, 77, that era, but 77 is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I had Deadhead OG, I made
grateful dog and then I made 77 from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 never got released.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can't have it, but that is how
grateful dog got made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Deadhead OG reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selfed it and then it's an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the selfed from the Deadhead
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, here's where the story gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm checking my notes to make sure I'm
staying on track here because I'm high and
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends for the lemon
Jeffrey concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a grateful dog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a bunch of seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find one that's a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep this one champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere I go in town, anytime I open up
my bag or pack a bowl or roll a joint or
[SPEAKER_00]: light a bowl, people go, bro, what kind of
weed is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was fire in my opinion on a lot
of other people's opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was top quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best herb I ever bred and or
grew and or smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you people hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's always sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to go see a concert at Red
Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I was at either reggae on the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was a reggae on the rocks and
revolution was the headlining act.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was way into revolution at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up going to this concert by
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that was supposed to go with me
backed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't able to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to reggae on the rocks by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a concert by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be 9,000 other people there
to make friends with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go to the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anytime I go to a concert,
I roll up a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, they used to be more
strict about letting you take weed into
[SPEAKER_00]: concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they don't really care very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, they used to be more
they would scrutinize you more for having
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would patch you down, search you,
take your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my theory was I'd put three joints in
this pocket, three joints in this pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: three joints here, three joints here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just be a walking joint
dispenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if they found these three,
they'd go I got your weed and they'd quit
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd still have 30 more joints tucked
away somewhere in my clothing that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a bunch of joints in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several bands ahead of
revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're smoking and just hanging out
dancing to the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept a joint burning the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just did not put out a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided here's where I'm standing,
lit up a joint, started smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that joint went out,
I flicked the roach, light up another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not going to run out of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that this kid next to me,
this dude next to me about my age,
[SPEAKER_00]: he looked cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was smoking weed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed every time I would light a
joint, he would look over like,
[SPEAKER_00]: damn, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would light his own joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would smell his weed and go,
nah, mine's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was better, I would have shared
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he had good weed that enticed me,
I would have been like, can I hit your
[SPEAKER_00]: weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would add a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, I got the good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna stay over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just hung out by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, after a few joints and me
lighten up a joint and that dude lighten a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint, me lighten another and he lighten
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my stuff smelled better than his
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the grateful dog is all I was
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually he leans over and he goes,
man, you got some really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, thank you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asks, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him it's called the grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this is like, this was Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around probably 2008, 2009, maybe
2010-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could check and find the exact date.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know when this happened and I know
the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around that time, this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around that time, everybody in
Colorado, every white guy with dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_00]: was a new seed breeder, had some new hash
company, had a new dispensary or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was like, I bred this,
he was just kind of like, eh, he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, where can I get a cut
of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, ah, man, I don't really
want to sell a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he introduced himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, well, my name is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I say his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is history, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get the history right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my buddy Noah said, my name is Noah,
and I am the owner of Mile High Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, so this was around the
same year that Mile High Green Cross won
[SPEAKER_00]: first place in the Denver High Times
Cannabis Cup for their Banana Kush or
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to reference that date when
Mile High Green Cross won the Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cup for their Banana Kush or
Banana OG, it's Banana that's all I needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same year that this story
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Revolution was at Red Rocks that year
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the year that this story took
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my boy Noah says, I own Mile High Green
Cross, and I've been smoking Banana Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: and it smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, I'd be willing to give
you this much money for a cut of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd been thinking that if anybody
wanted a cut of that plant, that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: number that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me the number that I had had in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acceptable deal, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about two and a half hours from where
we are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut the clones for you as soon as I
get home from this adventure seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in about two weeks, give me a
call, come to my house, and we'll fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you this clone for the money
that you offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, that's how Noah acquired
that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he followed through.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me into, I came home,
I cut the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half-ish weeks later,
he came down and picked up his clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he came down, he also brought me
other clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I got the Action Bronson Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Silver Chem, Chem D to Super
Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which order that's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I got the Action Bronson
Cut, which made a couple of great crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of really great plants actually
came.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hell's OG actually came from our
friend Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would just trade me and bring me a lot
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We established a pretty cool relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give Noah a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that when I was giving Noah clones
that my clone techniques sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut a bunch of clones of Grateful Dog,
hoping to get a couple of solid cuts to
[SPEAKER_00]: give to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted them to root so that he could
have something fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he got here to get them, he looked
disappointed in my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, my clone skill was
lacking at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't where I am now, which I'm not sad
to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to learn everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clones really sucked at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, bro, what you need is an
easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, the clone machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he showed me pictures and videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I need one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he wanted a bunch of cuts from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff that I wasn't really excited to
let go of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes you have clones you don't
want to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I'll share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some you can't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I want a couple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, he made an offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of us made an offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered to trade me an easy cloner
machine for a couple of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was he bought an easy
cloner and brought it to my place where I
[SPEAKER_00]: was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went into my mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut clones and filled up the easy
cloner machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me how to get it running,
get it dialed in, get it pHed and set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to cut the clones, how to put them in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about 10 days later, he got to come
back and pick up the clones of choice out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he got paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traded him those cuts for the easy
cloner and the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how my clone game got
springboarded, got leaps and bounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement was from my friend Noah from
Mile High Green Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear this, bro, fist bump,
big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of lost touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he's in the cannabis
industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of doing his own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of don't keep in touch anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing his.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never lose touch for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how this industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so my buddy gets the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We meet each other at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes to my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We develop a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches me how to fill the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got his grateful dog clone that
he takes into a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: He acquires a commercial grow in that
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lot of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lot of my plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would give him seed packs and let him
run the seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would bring me back the
keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a pretty cool setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Noah's got my clone of grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running it in his commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, Noah decides he doesn't want
that commercial facility anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws change so much that a lot of
people that were in it for the passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart, we couldn't come up with the
million dollars that we needed for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the new rule changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of doing that, a lot of people
just sold out, sold their business,
[SPEAKER_00]: got some money and got out of the business
because it went to corporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pushed out all the people with heart
and they gave it to all the people with
[SPEAKER_00]: suits and no knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's all commercial,
corporate, crappy weed now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries because the people that care
about it, we want to do a good job,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the people in the suits, they want
money coming in yesterday and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: messes it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my buddy Noah gets out of the industry
and he sells his grow to a guy by the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin is the owner of Ethos Collective or
Ethos Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how Colin acquired my grateful dog
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, he's got full access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can do whatever he wants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can breed with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got my beans, you're allowed to
breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a clone that came from me,
you're allowed to breed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just cough or fart or sneeze or
meditate one day or pull them out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make seeds out of thin air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to use seeds and or clones that came
from, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody invented cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all using other people's creations,
other people's platforms, other people's,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it?
Foundations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all using other people's seeds and
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel no territorial or no whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one of my plants in there and
you list it on the package, give me some
[SPEAKER_00]: credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe send me a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do everything ethically and cool,
it may be beneficial for you to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is one of my crosses in there that
makes things desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put something good in it,
people want that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colin acquires my grateful dog through
the purchase of Noah's commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, he can do whatever he wants
with it, which is where he bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he created his own Colin OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's grateful dog,
Sour Diesel and the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's flow in there somewhere,
I do believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have Googled that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is Colin's creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Colin OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there absolutely is some grateful dog
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's address that second part of
the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of touched on it just a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he buy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this a collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really a collab and he did not
buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did do the breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, he is making packs and giving me
credit after the fact, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: admirable and respectful of that guy to
give me credit after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the part about is this a collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, no, but un-technically,
yeah, we're all collabing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that I have put their pollen in my
seeds or their seeds in my pollen or my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in their pollen together,
we're technically collabing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always an approved or an endorsed
or signed or whatever planned out collab
[SPEAKER_00]: for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, anybody that all you guys out
there, if you use one of my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: a female or a male, and you breed it to
something, technically, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can say we collabed,
I can't deny it, because my pollen is in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, technically, we did collab,
but un-technically, no, it wasn't like a
[SPEAKER_00]: planned thought out collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just did his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't be mad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed with a lot of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon, what is it the lemon OG haze
that I worked with that came from Colin
[SPEAKER_00]: and I made the sonic boom out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't be mad about him working with
my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever hear this, bro, hope you're
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he's learning to play
piano pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can play some drums a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some funky jazz piano drums sort
of stuff together one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my notes and get myself back
on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I covered the main portions
of this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all collabing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other collabs when I do call
breeders and I say, hey, do you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we talk about it and we do plan
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, it's just me
selecting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun when you talk to,
I can't tell you who I'm trying to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with right now, but there's one breeder
and I'm like, hey, I want to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, let me find the perfect
phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like this, and we're kind of
planning it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to select one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to select the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to breed that shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't tell you too much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of those in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I think I should talk about for
this episode because I have said a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we just leave this episode
just grateful dog, it'll be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: standalone topic on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
