Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends and a Mystic Roots
[SPEAKER_00]: band for letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that was much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is actually
take two of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded for a few minutes and realized
I was not feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a little break, took a couple of
fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed some cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some dabs of a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have risen and I have cooled the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the podcast zone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're dabbed out just like I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smoking a blunt,
smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're smoking a twax joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're smoking some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're doing, I hope you're
feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're nice and red-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a
shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevate Glass at 517 South Tejon in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I scored two brand new Elevate
bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just buy these bangers from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mess them up real bad, make them real,
real chased up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just buy the cheap ones, throw them away
and replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate for
keeping me laced up with fresh glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of fresh glass, I got this brand
new carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is shiny black glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the black glass look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fresh, pretty sleek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a directional carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the shape of kind of like a chess
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like maybe a pawn on a
chess board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.

themselves 303 Goatweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they gave me a five star review
and it says, this is simply the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the great content.

you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome for all the great
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't owe the success of your grow to
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may owe some of the guidance to this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome, but you did the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listened, you learned, you took notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went in there and actually did the
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was shout out instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You followed instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The success was you and your grow and you
paying attention and loving those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you gave me some credit
for that, but you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to meet all you guys someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, dude, I am going to the dude
grows cup on four 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's April 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's kind of a private party.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to listen to the dude grow show
podcast for more information and come join
[SPEAKER_00]: me and some of my friends at the dude
grows cup in Denver on April 15th,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, tentatively plan to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise that my friends will be
there, but planned to be there scheduled
[SPEAKER_00]: to appear are myself, dab and granny,
the traveling stoner, uh, Bobo blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all goes well, a white Mike will be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemo punk 15 white Mike, Mike from the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't get out much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to get him up there to
the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be a chance for you to come
dab and meet all of us and get iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't happen because I spoke of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I sneeze here randomly,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a very professional podcast move right
there, but we're not even going to edit
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come dab with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in Colorado, there's a good
chance that you can get into this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a Colorado person,
if you're not going to be in Colorado for
[SPEAKER_00]: April 15th, let's make some arrangements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since your screen name was 303
goatweed, I kind of think you're a Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: person because that's the 303.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, listen to the dude grows podcast and
get to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by the time this comes out,
this will come out Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event will be Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have time to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you'll be able to get on the
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I've said too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: 303 goatweed, uh, five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said the title of the review was,
this is your go-to for cannabis grow info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you at an event in the very
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were at an event in Colorado,
I want you to find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got dreadlocks to my ass,
uh, almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them to one of them probably
touches my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually keep my hair in a bun on the
back of my head because I don't need my
[SPEAKER_00]: dreads tangled up in all your shit as we
walk by each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I usually wear a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my hat backwards crooked to the
left so I could reach with my left hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've usually got sunglasses on cause my
eyes are red and I don't need you seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: my red ass eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a ginger beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: My beard grows in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually wearing an iry genetics
t-shirt or quite frequently nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing a grow from your heart podcast
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now I got a little boo-boo on
my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hurt my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, give me a little fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be friends still, but I want you to
come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like hearing on social media when
people say, Hey dude, I saw you at this
[SPEAKER_00]: event, but I didn't want to come say hi
cause I didn't want to bother you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not bothering me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to meet each and every freaking
one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get onto the next comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next, uh, Facebook review,
Facebook, is that fucking Facebook?
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you could tell from those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review says it's from a person who
calls himself me 4437.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the review is wealth of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information is more comprehensive
than any book on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend hundreds, a hundred hours
filling your head with quality material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's straight into the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's exactly, I thought about
doing a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I started writing the outline to
write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that every week when I
would write about cannabis, shit would
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rules would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ideas would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that was available to us would
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, man, I can't write a book
because it evolves every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was talking to some friends at,
uh, Spence and Maddie's house and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I keep her repeating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should record this and just tell people
to go listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, that's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had another podcast with a friend
where occasionally I would talk about pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was, this show started off kind
of as a spinoff from another show so that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could focus on weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of doing a book, I thought
I'll do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely true that it's more
comprehensive than any book because I can
[SPEAKER_00]: update you every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something changes, I can tell you
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A book, once it's published, I got to make
a whole new edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go back and amend everything
that sucks with a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can jump in at any time and say,
Hey, what I said last week, wrong update.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way more comprehensive than any book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a hundred hours filling your head with
quality material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 196 episodes out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of those are old flashback
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's probably, I would say over a
hundred hours of quality material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys need something to listen
to, go back and check out the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I mentioned it, I am putting out
the old episodes in chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put them out at least three
episodes at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to make about a three, three and a
half to four hour file.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as large as my recording software
will hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's as big as iTunes really
wants to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you guys downloading podcasts,
it's probably a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the old episodes that I've been
putting out, I want some reviews and some
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know what you think,
how I'm doing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you love it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I do it differently to make it better
for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people wanted those old
episodes and that was the best way I could
[SPEAKER_00]: think of to put them out quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep promising you that some of them are
posted one through 25 should be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, I got way off track there,
but me four, four, three, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, another five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, iTunes asks you, was this review
helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click yes, because yes,
that was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on 303 goatweed, I'm clicking yes on
your review also because that review was
[SPEAKER_00]: very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thank you for the five star
reviews and thank you for the other
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the next review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, I look forward to this
podcast every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they gave me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left by a person who calls himself
selves B T L eight four zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this, the grow from
your heart podcast has a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting yet practical topics on every
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy the laid back manner in which
is, which it is presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is very informative and thorough,
but speaks in layman's terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone could take advantage of his
expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: As he is a plethora of gardening wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody just described me with the
word wisdom, which is kind of fun to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never thought of myself as a wizard
or an expert, but if you called me that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's official, didn't make that shit up
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I truly appreciate, I know I'm joking
around, but I truly appreciate that
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, interesting yet practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, laid back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be a laid back guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to get up tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't doing rocket surgery here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing a plant to make us relax and
feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be super stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just smoke a bunch of this
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're chilled out anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, informative and thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking layman's terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when, uh, when I go to the
doctor or when I go somewhere and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: tries to talk to me and using a bit,
they use a whole bunch of glossary words
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to sound fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're just schmucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, can't you just say instead of
using what I don't even have an example
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but instead of using some big
fancy word, you could have said blanket
[SPEAKER_00]: and they just made up some fancy word for
blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was 17 syllables and it makes them
feel good about themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they're trying to be little.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, I think, uh, I think it's better when
I just talk to you, like you're me and we
[SPEAKER_00]: just get along like we're friends and I
don't have to impress you with my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my plethora of glossary terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem useful to me,
but anyway, layman's terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plethora of gardening wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, honestly, the way I learned a lot of
what I was doing was just by fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of, uh, I'm brave,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try some stuff in the garden that
most people wouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not afraid to fuck some stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people rely too heavily on the
income of their garden or the medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're going to receive from their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate enough to have,
I live in Colorado, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the past two, or 10 years at least
I've worked or been involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always had plenty of cannabis
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been plenty of medicine
available to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also had plenty of grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my own grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had friends help me and let me help
them grow in their spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had large facilities to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a lot of places to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes if I had 10 lights,
I would dedicate two lights to trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck something up and see what would
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just by going in and seeing what
happens when I totally try to destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can they take?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Ooh, when I bent this this
way and broke it this way, it really grew
[SPEAKER_00]: like a champ like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a lot by screwing things up
and taking risks and being brave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that that could help
for most growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be so afraid to mess with your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't treat it like it's a little baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've joked about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has been, it's grown on the
side of a rocky mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Afghanistan, it got beat up by the
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got rained on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got pissed on by a goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got it's had a snake hiding underneath
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been through all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've evolved to survive through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made to protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can beat the shit out of them in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plethora of gardening knowledge and
wisdom, a lot of that has come just by
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and error and not being afraid to
screw things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BTL 840.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for looking forward to the podcast
every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear this review and I hope you
get kinda giddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am rambly tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dabs really hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good dabs, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna read another review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is says, the lemon G of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment because in
Colorado, the lemon G is sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lemon G turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be a Colorado person if you know
about that lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the lemon G is from is what I
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this guy calls himself Darrell
Straub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review, of course, five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm here for is to
contribute to the community, to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow better plants, to help you stay
informed and educated about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll tell other people about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll tell your grandma some stuff
about cannabis or your mom some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe make them not so afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes time for people to vote
about cannabis, they'll vote on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll tell some of their friends
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just here to support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that I try to keep it
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the five star review,
Darrell Strawberry Jr. And then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: one more review left on the same day as
Darrell Strawberry Jr. This one's left by
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody named Darrell Strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you might have two accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the double reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read them both for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says I and I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, Darrell Strawberry Jr. and your
partner, you got to have some Rasta belief
[SPEAKER_00]: in there if you say I and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, I appreciate the hard work you do
on the podcast and in the community in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to cannabis or an old
crusty fart, this is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just learning about growing
weed, smoking weed, consuming weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to do research about cannabis,
this podcast will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a crusty old fart, if you've
been smoking forever, if you smoked weed
[SPEAKER_00]: through a gun in Vietnam, this podcast is
still for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a dab kid trying to take three
gram dabs off of an e-nail, this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical smoker taking one puff
off of a joint every six hours to
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate some symptoms, this podcast is
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put this podcast out for
everybody who's interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that Darrell
Strawberry and Darrell Strawberry Jr. I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate all of the reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I'm
rambling about these reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love it if you'd go to iTunes and
leave me a rating and a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far everyone's left me five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 51 five star ratings, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to press
pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and then when we
get back, I'm going to talk about a worker
[SPEAKER_00]: protection safety class I took recently
and we'll talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made a marvelous discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new carb cap that I picked up at
Elevate today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a directional flow carb cap,
which means when you cap the banger,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to explain the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The banger, instead of using a titanium
nail, I'm using a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: A banger looks kind of like a glass bowl,
looks like a little bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits right where your bowl would go
kind of on your smoking device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just a little glass bowl and
you heat that and you put the dab in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you cover it with a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is kind of you can let
it get a little cooler and then you cap it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't have to take such a hot
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier on your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cap it, it kind of stokes the
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It traps the heat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lower heat cooks the dab a little
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You draw the oxygen over the trapped heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your dab a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cooler, it's softer, it's smoother,
it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just discovered that this carb cap,
it's directional flow, which means when I
[SPEAKER_00]: cap it, I can turn it and that will stir
my oil around on the nail a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: the banger a little bit better so that I
can get a more efficient burn on my oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of move it around instead of
puddling up in one spot where it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can move it around to a hot spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a better dab, but also it's got kind
of an extended piece on the top of it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a hole in it, which of course it's got a
hole in it so that the air can flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I figured that if I put my finger on
that hole, I can really control the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of airflow I get up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got a really killer dab with
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best dab I've had with it so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my friends at Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I know I'm kissing their asses
a whole bunch on this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they take really good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this really cool, this torch,
this coil condenser torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the monkeys on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some bananas on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my Hitman Hammerhead side car rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my brand new banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my brand new carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm using my Taterglass pencil
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all laced up from our friends at
Elevate, and I couldn't be happier about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't park on the main streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Park on one of the side streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take advantage of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course let them know that you
listen to the Girl From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, recently I took a
class in Denver sponsored by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: State University and the Department of
Agriculture and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Protection Agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The class was a worker protection safety,
train the trainer class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now certified to train people in
worker protection safety, which involves
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in agricultural applications,
which means now I can train my employees,
[SPEAKER_00]: my coworkers, and other growers and other
workers in other facilities on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: safely handle pesticides under EPA
guidelines and under Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course under the Marijuana
Enforcement Division guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the class cost me $65 to take,
but it was definitely worth every penny
[SPEAKER_00]: because I learned, it was invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned more information than I could
have ever imagined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a four hour class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it could have probably have been
condensed to about three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the host, the lady that taught the
class, her name was Thea.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a great instructor.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kept my attention the entire time,
you guys, usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not the ideal student in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to keep my mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to sit still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to pay attention for the entire
four hour class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like I needed to get up and
run out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job to Thea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I really did learn,
you guys, was that pesticide safety is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: As growers, most of us are not paying
attention to the safety of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might read the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might follow those guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we overlook everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk a little bit about important
stuff here when it comes to pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I learned things that home growers
will benefit from, that commercial benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: growers will benefit from, that indoor and
outdoor growers will benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coughing from the dab I took.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally creeping up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big old fat dab of some cactus
cooler that's starting to set in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pesticide safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing is to read the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every pesticide that you buy on the
front, it's got that little booklet that
[SPEAKER_00]: opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peel that open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need is
going to be on that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell you what kind of
protective equipment you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying a product, a pesticide,
you almost always need long sleeves,
[SPEAKER_00]: long pants, shoes and socks, and gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, they're going to
recommend some sort of eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to wear some sort of
goggles that have protection all around,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the kind of goggles with holes in the
side for air, but the ones that protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should also wear protective gear when
you're mixing your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly wear those goggles when you're
mixing a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes one little splash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you're pouring, I'm just going to
pick evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you've got some evergreen or some
Pyganic, something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pouring it from the bottle into
whatever you're going to pour it into to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: One drop, just when that liquid hits the
other liquid and it drops and splashes,
[SPEAKER_00]: one drop into your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to the eye doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucked up for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to ruin your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got an incident report.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at a commercial grow,
you got paper to fill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got to explain how you got
evergreen in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good idea to get shit in your
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of pesticides will require
some sort of a respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to go get an expensive
respirator and keep the cartridges
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pink cartridges that pop onto the
sides, they're not very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth your health to change
those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what kind of personal protective
equipment you need for the pesticides that
[SPEAKER_00]: you plan on applying and get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in a commercial grow,
beyond the long sleeve shirt, pants,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes, and socks, it's up to your employer
to provide proper personal protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to them to get you a
respirator, goggles, maybe a Tyvek suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a Tyvek suit if you're
spraying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Ag does require that you
throw them away after each use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use it for your own
personal grow, maybe you can use it a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say much about that because I am
trained on how to teach you how to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, so I'm supposed to tell you
throw those away after each use if you use
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is because it's got
pesticide on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to store it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going to be until you use it
next time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you not going to spread pesticides
from that to your skin when you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and putting it on next time?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are concerns with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much pesticide is going to penetrate
that suit while it is sitting there?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is not just the pesticide
that's a contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the solvent that carries the
pesticide, because maybe whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying is not always a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to put it in a liquid to carry
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's a solvent and will cause
problems, which reminds me to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you are mixing and applying a
pesticide, that those nitrile gloves we're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying at the grow store or that we're
getting at, what's the place called over
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harbor Freight or that you're buying from
Uline, those are probably not approved by
[SPEAKER_00]: the EPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a 15 mil or thicker glove if
you're going to be mixing and applying
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gloves that we are probably using are
probably around six mils, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones you're getting from Harbor
Freight that you get from Uline or the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow store, those are six mil gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're millimeters, 15
millimeters thick to prevent from a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide leaking through that glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that the Department of
Agriculture and the EPA recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get myself back on track, read the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you peel back that little booklet on
the bottle, it's going to tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment is required
to use that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you use all of the stuff it
recommends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's going to have what's called a
re-entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell you how long after the
application ends, how long you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait before somebody re-enters that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from the time you stop spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spraying, spraying, spraying
when you stop now, that's when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the products that we are using,
they usually have a four-hour re-entry
[SPEAKER_00]: interval, which is not too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do most of your work, you turn off the
lights, you spray the plants, then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to wait four hours before you can go
back in there and turn them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is stuff that you can do if you need
to go in there early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would do what's called an early
re-entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to probably have to suit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to come in contact with
the plants, you need all of the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to suit up and be safe in there
so that you don't come in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: these pesticides and end up spreading
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we're going to talk about
in the next rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, inside that little booklet is going
to have all the instructions of what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do mess up with this pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spill it, if you get some in your
eye, if you get some in your mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you get some on your skin,
all of what to do will be listed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: booklet inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read that before you use the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not have some sort of idea what's
going to happen if you do fuck up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody thinks I'm not going to
get this in my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get it in my mouth,
but shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never plan on getting into a car
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never plan on making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never plan on having accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're called accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what you may need to do,
especially if you're alone, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nobody else around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're far from places or whatever,
be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you put the phone
number to Poison Control in your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very easy number to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, here, I'll make it easy so nobody
has to search for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phone number for the American
Association of Poison Control Centers is
[SPEAKER_00]: 1-800-222-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 1-2-2-2 at the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked that up a little for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1-800-222-1-2-2-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Poison Control Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever got a problem, hopefully
you've got some voice dialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hold down the button and you can
say, I need poison control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll call you or you can call that and
they'll help you figure out if you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the hospital, if you need to flush
your stomach, if you need to puke,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you need to not puke, if you need to
rinse your eyes out, if you need to just
[SPEAKER_00]: set yourself on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to explain what you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will certainly help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that number in your phone,
but read what could go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spraying, maybe you're just
spraying, I keep saying evergreen or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're going to use in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about evergreen recently,
so it's on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're applying whatever
pesticide you're applying with a sprayer
[SPEAKER_00]: and you forgot to turn off a fan and you
spray it and it hits that fan and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: blows right back into your eyeballs
because you're not wearing protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for your eyeballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now your eyes are all fucked up,
so now you can't read that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to call one of your friends,
you're going to call 911, or you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to call poison control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have read the label before,
you'd have a little bit of an idea what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper thing to do would probably be
to start flushing your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, this may sound crazy,
I highly recommend having some sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye wash or an eye flush in your grow near
your pesticides, near something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it near the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scratch that I said that because you don't
want to fuck up and go thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pouring some rinse in your eye and
end up pouring more evergreen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in your back pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it somewhere safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just need some water to rinse your eyes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidents do happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the labels of every product you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may also change your mind on if you
want to use it in your garden or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you've read the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have properly mixed your pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wore the proper protective equipment
while you were mixing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've applied it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you were waiting the proper
re-interval time before you go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and check on how everything went.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know if those plants got fried
or if you killed the bugs or if they look
[SPEAKER_00]: better, or you just want to go in there
and get back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wait a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing to do after you have
applied these pesticides is to carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: take off all of your personal protective
equipment and clean yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wearing a respirator,
think about when you grab that respirator
[SPEAKER_00]: to take it off, do you have pesticides on
your hands or gloves that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: rub onto your face that's going to move up
into your eye?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you go scratching your
face or balls or wherever, are you
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading pesticide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your gloves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your suit off in a proper order to
where you're not spreading shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take off the gloves because
it's all over your hands, then you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab the respirator and take that off,
and then you want to take off the
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing, and you want to clean your hands
very well before you eat, drink,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, use gum or tobacco or go to the
bathroom because, let me explain why going
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bathroom is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, your genitals,
your junk is the most absorbive,
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb, what the fuck's the word I'm
trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me rephrase it so it makes
more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your genitals will absorb more pesticides
than any other part of the skin on your
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little softer, has more mucous
membranes, more nerves, more veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll suck up more of the pesticides,
so wash your hands before you grab your
[SPEAKER_00]: junk and go to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly wash your hands before you eat
or drink or anything, and if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke or chew gum or tobacco,
certainly wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get those pesticides in
your mouth or in anything you're eating,
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking or smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them taste like shit anyway,
but they're toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it when you're unsuiting after
you've sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it in the proper order so that you
don't spread stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash your hands thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all of your dirty clothing,
all of your dirty gear somewhere that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get washed with your family's
normal clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to wash whatever your
spouse, your boyfriend, your girlfriend,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mom, your baby, your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to wash your clothes that
have pesticides in it with their clothes,
[SPEAKER_00]: so think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash your clothes in the washer
separately, then run it with hot water
[SPEAKER_00]: again or cool water to rinse it if you
don't want to waste hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then wash everybody else's clothes after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go washing straight one after the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying not to spread pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the part that I've labeled
pesticide spread in my little note here on
[SPEAKER_00]: my iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we put just a little bit of dye
inside of the pesticide sprayer,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you use as a pesticide sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I dropped what's called tracer
dye in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tracer dye is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's invisible to the naked eye,
but if I shine a black light over it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show up like DNA on a blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some of this tracer dye inside of
the pesticide sprayer, and then you apply
[SPEAKER_00]: your pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go shine that light everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticide is going to be on the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be on the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be on the floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to be on your shoes,
your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be on the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be everywhere, so that
pesticide has now gotten all over your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room if you're in an indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the light reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to walk out of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those shoes and spread that pesticide
into your car, and then put those
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides into your house, because it's
on your shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to bring that home to your
pets, to your family, to your children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that is sick, that may compromise
their health.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to apply pesticides,
please have a dedicated set of clothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like I said earlier, hopefully possibly
a Tyvek suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing cannabis, you can
probably afford a couple of Tyvek suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that fits in your budget,
but think about pesticide spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring pesticides home to
your family and your pets, so have a
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated set of clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've applied pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you go back in there and you work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were rubbing up against those plants
that have been treated with the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those walls have pesticides, like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in there is now a pesticide
contamination zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to wear long sleeves in your
grow, and you may want to take those
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes off before you go anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to shower before you go
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about pesticide spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a lot of people
paranoid because a lot of people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying pesticide willy-nilly for the
past hundred years and haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to think about it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to make other people sick,
and we want to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep the environment healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis to save people's
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to make ourselves and other
people sick in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I want to touch on while
I'm talking about the tracer dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you're washing your hands
and cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you shine the light over the sink where
you're cleaning up, the knobs are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show the tracer dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sink where you were cleaning up is
going to probably have tracer dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to clean up the
cleanup area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend cleaning up your
respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend reusing the gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a one-time use thing most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 15 mil latex gloves or the nitrile
or that butyl or whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the word right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are one-time use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is they don't want them turning
inside out when you swap them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much at this pesticide class,
you guys, that I just feel like I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide nerd now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they don't want them turning
inside out when you take it off and on
[SPEAKER_00]: because then you're going to get the
pesticide right back on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe with the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a very useful hint that the
instructor of the class taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said if you spill something,
kitty litter is probably the easiest way
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle some kitty litter on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kitty litter will absorb the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dispose of it
properly because it's a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have to go into the
hazardous waste container somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot pour it down a drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot dump it in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be disposed of properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of areas do a disposal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a year, they have a big party at a
park or something where you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: come bring all your shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small home grow,
that's a great way to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a commercial grow,
you're going to have to pay for hazardous
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean up shit with the kitty
litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a hole in a bottle,
you can drop a chunk of kitty litter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottle and it will expand in the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of cause a little temporary
seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a piece of duct tape on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably make that bottle last a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are done with the pesticide
bottle, you're supposed to rinse it out
[SPEAKER_00]: three times so that it is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, they were never clear about
where to rinse that because you can't pour
[SPEAKER_00]: that rinse down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably put it into a sprayer and spray
it onto some plants if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're supposed to rinse the bottle
three times and then you're supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: poke holes in it so that if somebody finds
that container, they don't try to drink
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it or use it as a vessel for a
beverage or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that's a little excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, trace or die, it'll teach you a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about disposal of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you are done spraying,
when you're done applying a pesticide and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some leftover, like I said
earlier, you are not supposed to dump that
[SPEAKER_00]: down the toilet, down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to go in the dumpster
that is now hazardous waste that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be disposed of properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please dispose of it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing you could probably do is
learn exactly how much pesticide you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to mix up, mix up that much and spray that
much and don't have any leftover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take two or three, maybe four
or five tries before you get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please just learn how much you need,
mix up the proper amount, apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you need to, just spray the
rest of it on on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a little excessive,
or you can find another crop that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable to spray that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got other plants outside,
you can spray those plants with that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go crazy, just spraying
pesticides on random ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be wasteful with pesticides and
learn how to mix up what you need and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to just properly dispose of what you don't
need, which is just waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just learn how to mix it properly
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work in a commercial grow like I
do, we've got at least 100 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on another facility with 400
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are next door to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll basically be me running a 500
light project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very careful when we mix up
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning how much each room needs if
we're going to apply something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning how much water we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to water each room because if we
mix up too much nutrients, we have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of that properly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth, hopefully you never know with
the way shit's going, but hopefully this
[SPEAKER_00]: earth is going to be here much longer than
you or I and our children and their
[SPEAKER_00]: children and their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this earth sticks around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your part to make it pretty for your
grandchildren's grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a selfish bitch with your
pesticides and your nutrients and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep it clean for our kids because
they need some more to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I've been ranting for a long time,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you for listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're learning something about
pesticides because it is a very serious
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very overlooked in commercial grows
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everybody that was in the
class, there were 16 people in the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five of them were actually
dispensary and grow owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of them were grow managers or
cultivation managers or somebody that was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for applying pesticides in a
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all marijuana people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people, everybody in the
class seemed to have one of those oh my
[SPEAKER_00]: goodness moments where we all learned
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of my questions were answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you guys learned something from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at the beginning of the show,
I did not mention that the event was also
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by the MIG, the Marijuana
Investors Group is what I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left them out when I described who
hosted the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in a marijuana enforcement
division, regulated grow, or if you work
[SPEAKER_00]: in any sort of agricultural place where
there are pesticides, I think you would
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a lot from taking this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only $65.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a link, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can set you up with Thea, the host of
the class, and she can let you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's time and room for you to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time it was at the cash register
building in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part is finding somewhere to
park.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in a Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division regulated facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are actually required to be worker
protection safety trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your employer's responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you touch plants, you need to be worker
trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply pesticides, you need to be
handler trained is what I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have that done very soon
before the Department of Ag comes in and
[SPEAKER_00]: does an inspection on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a good idea if you have a grow
in Colorado to call the Department of Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: and schedule what is called a compliance
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come and make sure that you're
compliant before they come in and bust
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they can show you all the shit
you're doing wrong and you can correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Ag wants you to get it
right there on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, anybody that takes the class
that I just spoke of is allowed to train
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all of the training materials
right here next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on a thumb drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got two giant books,
one from the Environmental Protection
[SPEAKER_00]: Agency and one from the Colorado
Department of Ag sponsored by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big, thick, giant books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trainer certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can train anybody in the state of
Colorado for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: On how to be worker protection safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need training, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to come to your facility for
a small fee and teach your employees on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to handle these pesticides safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all jacked up on dabs and Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm going a million miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time for me to wrap up the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
