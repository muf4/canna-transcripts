[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 366 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome to the show our buddy,
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Managed to sneak out and record a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm glad you did not freeze to death
on the way here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a frosty, cold Colorado night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate being correct with predictions,
but I always say that we have to arrange
[SPEAKER_00]: our Halloween costumes around the first
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you fully do?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually the third snow,
but we totally got shit weather and we got
[SPEAKER_00]: snow on Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, if you're going to do a
costume, you need a winter insulated
[SPEAKER_01]: backup or just plan for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just maybe you got to be sweaty
all night inside it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to be Tinkerbell or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like slutty nurse has a shit night.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado every year because it's 20
degrees here on Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you went with slutty nurse
as the next option of costume choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in a nicer part of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as jacked up as other parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other parts of town I live,
we didn't expect trick-or-treaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get none, didn't expect none.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knew that shit was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my new neighborhood, you'd expect
trick-or-treaters pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw maybe six kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not much traffic in my
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you live in a nice part of town too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd expect kids coming here all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was cold and there was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I was Chewbacca and that is just a
giant furry bodysuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wearing a fur all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wearing a shag carpet bodysuit,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a big giant mask that is basically
like wearing the IPM suit all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the respirator on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least you're not under grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was at a show that was quite warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were blowing glass right next to the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the glass blowing heat was
coming and then they had live fire
[SPEAKER_00]: spinners at the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Heady Halloween event hosted
by Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know my life listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you don't know, he's got two
kids, which means he's pretty much at
[SPEAKER_01]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sneaking out to record a podcast is the
only interesting thing I get to do that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not child care related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a good Halloween,
bro, since we're talking about Halloween?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little kids and Halloween are made for
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Halloween smile is magical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mall here does a thing for the
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of people dressed up
in fun costumes tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mall lets you go trick or treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really cool event, especially in
Colorado where your Halloween can be
[SPEAKER_01]: miserable and you know, 25, 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no fun when you're a five year old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a place to go where you can
trick or treat for an hour and not freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: to death is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you're fairly safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't cars going to run the kids
over there in the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, a kid got hit in Pueblo West
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that right before I came over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put this podcast back on a
positive note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Halloween, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a safe Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make an Edibles joke,
but we're not even going to make that a
[SPEAKER_00]: tasteless joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I'm going to give Mike some time to
talk about election stuff here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to talk about politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to talk about elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to talk about getting people
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I turn it over to Mike,
and we start talking about elections and
[SPEAKER_00]: politics, I want to talk about a recent
visit to a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked to come visit a hemp farm and
do a little bit of consultation to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with the project they have coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably shouldn't talk about their next
project, but there is plenty of other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hemp farm is huge, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want to hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This place is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to a legal Colorado hemp
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to an illegal Colorado
hemp farm either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know hemp farms from Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never thought of working or being
involved in a farm that large.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants are harvested in their
outdoor field, but the field, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: see the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey, I'm looking for this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, he's way out there at
the end of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, he'll be out here
in like 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it took him like 20 or 30 minutes to
walk from that field to where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was way out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was only an inch tall from how far away
I could see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That field is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a lot of plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive farms here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of camouflaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a hill to where, if you're not
looking for it, you wouldn't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the buildings and the
greenhouses and the farms, but the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space is kind of tucked down into
where when you're driving up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: highway that takes you to it, you don't
even see where the plants would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a bunch of gigantic plants
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got several greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got several barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got more plants in that
facility, the capability of more plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: that facility than probably 10 of the
indoor environments that we used to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size and the plant counts at hemp
farms are nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've seen some of the background info
and I followed this stuff closely enough
[SPEAKER_01]: in the press that, you know, you catch
some of this tangentially, but the numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: you see for hemp are insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of plants and they were
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say where I was so that I
can say more about what I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can't do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to reveal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell us about Bob's house if you
don't name Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw, I don't know what the names of
these containers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you took a mail carriers
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that like durable canvas work type
material.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the size that you could put a
Volkswagen Beetle into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they filled these canvas bags with
ground material ready to be turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD oils and concentrates to go into
salves and rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tinctures and lip balms and anything
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put CBN CBD in to apply to your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got that sort of delivery method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a whole bunch of extraction
equipment that is beyond where I've even
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their own lab testing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do a roll for national.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are trying to be prepared for when
things go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me they're ready for when the
FDA comes that they can already pass FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's strong odds that happens well
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or high THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get into sort of what exactly
is hemp in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you want to go that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The odds are strong that the feds lay off
hemp in CBD long before they lay off
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Paul Ryan, if you follow politics,
not a pro cannabis guy, not a liberal guy
[SPEAKER_01]: was just in the press touting CBD and
industrial hemp and lamenting the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that federal law still prohibits just like
it's high THC marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you that CBD will be more
acceptable legally before THC because it
[SPEAKER_00]: already it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the production facilities,
if you look at the way it's done,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have more than point three percent
THC in our plant, it is now considered
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and it can't be grown in a hemp
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a legal distinction here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the that's what declares the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk more about that in
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I noticed,
I am from the commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, the recreational and medical
cannabis environment where you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a badge with a long, extensive
background check.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can renew your stuff online,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me 15 minutes, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I re up right after they instituted that
process in the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, you're dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an easier way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, you can do it online,
you guys, if you need to renew your MED
[SPEAKER_00]: badge, it's super simple online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have the form notarized
and you don't need the fingerprints unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you were going for an associated key badge
or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just have a basic key badge,
the lady at the MED told me I do not need
[SPEAKER_00]: a new fingerprint card.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told me to turn in the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I need it, they'll email me and let
me know what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just turn it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: She seemed confident that nine out of 10
people are going to have issues and she
[SPEAKER_00]: has to call them back and it's no big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, just turn it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to work in the Colorado, Maryland,
marijuana regulated marijuana business,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have a marijuana enforcement
division badge, which you have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal background check.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do at least one fingerprint
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to fill out a bunch of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any legal background,
you have to clear that up and prove to
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado that you're going to be a good
kid and you're not going to go crazy in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people that had to drive across the
country and go to the courthouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got sentenced and in poll paperwork
by hand that said their shit was
[SPEAKER_01]: adjudicated and completed successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an actual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nightmare applying for that badge
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people that are in the hemp
industry are there because they have been
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked from the cannabis industry because
of their colored past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not a lot is colored past racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that rude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be politically correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checkered past.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're checkered past, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be in the industry because of
their checkered past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if anything I said came across as
politically incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be accurate lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play the TBI card real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get words confused anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listeners, if you're confused about
what the difference between marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis are, I feel like this is
the time in the show where we should cover
[SPEAKER_01]: that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get there, but I was
teasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really teasing about we have to have
a badge to work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the facility has to be, you have to
check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go into the facility,
you ring the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ring the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike or I runs to the door like,
oh, it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a reason to be in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had building inspectors a little
surprised that they were having to sign in
[SPEAKER_01]: and put on a lanyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, this is a secure facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just open my door and run from
the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secure facility is the greatest words.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sign in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to show me your ID that says who
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sign in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I give you a lanyard that says
whatever the name of my facility is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says visitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say Mike and Jeff's Grove
visitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have this big thing and somebody
has to be with you the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be escorted in visual sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, nothing can be visible in a
marijuana grove and a cannabis grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drive by and you can see cannabis
through the fence, they are in violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a hemp grove, dude, just a fence,
just like a six foot tall fence and 12
[SPEAKER_00]: foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can see it, that's a hard and
fast store rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with some of the production
facilities, especially here in public
[SPEAKER_01]: county, we allow outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fencing rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can see over the fence,
that's not one of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys, there are no MED requirements
in a hemp farm is where I'm headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I want to see in
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No badges.
[SPEAKER_00]: No badges at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody had to have a badge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no cameras that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to say go do anything,
but there are no cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a MED regulated facility,
you can't walk from one part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building to the other and have any gaps
where you are not seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be fully on camera at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are wiping your nose,
picking your nose, scratching your butt,
[SPEAKER_00]: itching your balls, you're on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Redundantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this room, there's a camera on that
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a camera on every wall in the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MED requirements for legal cannabis in
Colorado are nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fencing, like I said, was minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like a relaxed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as uptight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like a hospital and like a
prison at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets more of a grow feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with people who just came from
that industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rules that the MED has us
following, watching them adjust to those
[SPEAKER_01]: was really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if we were MED regulated or not,
we would have to tag plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to keep notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't have to do anything,
involving the MED, how much time do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you would save in a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it depends on the size of the
building, but I'm just thinking of the
[SPEAKER_01]: last facility that we kind of ran
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about several people that
aren't on the payroll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not on the payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other outside consultant that helped
with compliance probably wouldn't even be
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least three people in our
immediate work team.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that was right underneath you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that was right underneath me and
the two people right above me.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those people need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be gone because there's no MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two above you were high salaried
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not super high, but I mean decently
salaried people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we could get rid of four
employees, two hourly, one entry level,
[SPEAKER_00]: one managerial, and then two consultant
level employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about grow team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do hemp farms need to weigh their
waste leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they need to pulverize their garbage?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many hours did we kill on that
shredder?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a man hours in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to let you guys know what we're
talking about, in a MED regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, after you harvest a plant,
you've got all the sticks and stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just throw it in the trash that
the city picks up or that a private
[SPEAKER_00]: company picks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to run it through a wood chipper
to make it unrecognizable so that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: can identify what it is or was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MED wants it into tiny little pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would also run a bunch of old leaves
through that chipper because we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anywhere else to put them and they
had to be shredded and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would send Brian out there with a pack
of cigarettes and a wood chipper and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would honestly spend Saturday,
every Saturday, just chipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his whole job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards the end there, we had it on a
rotation and I'm trying to remember how
[SPEAKER_01]: often we had to run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was once or twice a week for at least
five or six hours of sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was before we doubled our production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the boys out there,
you have the bags of material out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the chipper running,
it's all fired up, it's out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trailer, it's a lot of work to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not required on a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start researching the different
applications for industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things that they're not really
explicitly about upfront when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about this is that you have to
pick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing for seed oil production,
you run your harvest one kind of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow a certain variety of hemp that
produces heavily for what you're seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to make clothes from
fiber, different genus of hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: both of those two different varieties are
going to have very low percent THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: less than 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to produce a very different
looking plant and you're going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: very different equipment, very different
retail markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't grow for fiber and for seed oil
and for replacement seed and hempcrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: This farm actually, I'm not going to say
who they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may figure it out, but I feel like
I can talk more about their business if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't say who they are is what I said
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They received a delivery from another farm
that they're going to turn into products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they were breaking it up, they
discovered seeds in it and they realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have to pull out every seed
because if they leave the seeds in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will change the spectrum of the oil
they're creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of their levels of quality
control that they go through out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different things that you
can do with an industrial hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The setup to get into it and get it up and
rolling is very intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a really nice setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine farming cannabis on a high
THC or on that scale, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between producing
high CBD flowers out there and producing
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC flowers out there other than a
lab test and a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said earlier you wanted to talk about
what constitutes hemp and what constitutes
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drove up and you didn't know the
difference, you couldn't tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in those plants by looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like high THC cannabis
plants that we grew in a facility
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no visual difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smell them, they do have a cherry
aroma that since I'm experienced and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I'm looking for, I can identify
that as part of what comes with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are structurally the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower just the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves, they were flushing one batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves look just the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no visual difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that gives you in Colorado,
the only thing that gives you a variance
[SPEAKER_00]: between marijuana or cannabis and hemp is
that lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant has 0.3% THC or higher,
it is considered marijuana or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that 3%, you're now working with
legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not entirely sure that I had put two
and two together in my head that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting the CBD from the bud material
just like we do with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, I was thinking something
out of the seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably knew this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't realize it and put it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're growing full blown flowers out
there to finish, to maturity, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they do it exactly,
but I saw several different extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: methods out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw large batches of crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw batches of distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw crystalline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They explained a few different ways that
they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They explained the ways that they prefer
to do it and their optional methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't like to do, but they will
because it's required sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their own lab test to make
sure that there is no THC in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they've got the capability to remove
the THC molecules from the products or the
[SPEAKER_00]: oils that they make, the extractions that
they make.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my questions was going to be,
are they working with any other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're banned from working with THC above
0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3%, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could work with any of the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not THCA, but you get what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the legalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they could work with CBG or CBN.
CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the legalities on any of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN was what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN is the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are thinking that one plays a big
part in anti-inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people looking for a
high CBN strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to keep down the
inflammation and combine that with the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only difference that we have
decided is that 0.3 test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd keep going back to that for some
reason, but that 0.3 makes it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than that makes it hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the extractions just like they
would if they were going to run a THC
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except they're aiming for just a pure CBD
product and no THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of a good section to segue
into my next note.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next note says hemp CBD is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people in the cannabis
community, the recreational and or the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical community that will argue that
hemp derived CBD is less quality or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the word inferior to cannabis derived CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you back me up?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a very valid argument to be made
that knowing and trusting your CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier right now is crucial because the
place you just toured isn't the only place
[SPEAKER_01]: producing CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are countless places around the US
in the different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably 12 or 15 different states
that have a hemp industry right now on
[SPEAKER_01]: some scale or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's countless CBD producers that are
producing god only knows what and slapping
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Chinese CBD and Russian CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all of this stuff coming in from
around the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these places just write CBD on
fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other places you're legitimately getting
exactly what's on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: But distinguishing the two is not
something everyone's capable of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will believe in the placebo
and keep buying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But buying hemp derived CBD from a trusted
supplier and buying CBD that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted from high THC cannabis
varieties, there's no difference in those
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDs other than one of them was grown in a
flower where it was in a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration and one of them was grown in
a flower with a lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were both extracted to whatever
concentration the extractor wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just why they're getting their source
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the reason CBD is so
expensive in the medical and recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: markets is because they're growing high
THC plants and trying to extract the 1% of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD into a whole gram jar takes for
fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a big push from the,
I mean, when I say established industry at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point in time, they weren't much more
established than like your local hot dog
[SPEAKER_01]: vendor, but the established industry at
the time when Colorado first was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, fuck, we might as well write the
hemp rules that were forced to write by
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go ahead and write those this next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they started to do that, the medical
industry that had been around for a minute
[SPEAKER_01]: in the emerging rec market were like,
yeah, it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally different molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to buy your shit at a higher
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that argument flared back up big time
when the FDA had to send warning letters
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of the Chinese imports saying,
knock that shit off and knock it off with
[SPEAKER_01]: the bogus health claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't prove.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat myself up a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab of high THC
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a high THC or if you would like
a high CBD dab, I've got that to offer you
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we've been talking about CBD so
much, I don't prefer to consume CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought I would offer that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we take these dabs, Mike,
we've been going for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should wrap up this hemp farm talk
and we should start talking about all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the political activism that you bring to
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just before we close out, I'm a little
jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go see a huge hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having fun picking it apart in my head
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll be doing consulting for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'll just take you out there and
say that you're my assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these days you just carry a
notebook and write down weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop pictures of weird stuff the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just carry it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure out something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a high likelihood I'll go see a
new grow tomorrow, but it's not a hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need an assistant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see new grows also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dab some copper chem from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the copper chem full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is chem four and Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says perfumey chem assorted
fruit bonbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get fuel and funk, so I'm going to hit
it and enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like gas and old fruit to me,
but that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't take that as a good thing,
but I fully think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're hitting that dab,
let's dive into election stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready for some politics listeners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go hit something on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll finish this dab of Jeff's real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely didn't take all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to choke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this episode drops on the night,
we think it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will drop Monday before Tuesday's
election.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully everybody listening is
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully most of the people listening
have taken advantage of early voting in
[SPEAKER_01]: some fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, it's all mail in elections
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You register to vote when you do your
driver's license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit shows up at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drop it off or mail it back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't be easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is on the ballot in several
states, including Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to take a minute on today's
show to encourage everybody, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: which way you lead on the political
spectrum, to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super important that people vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not be led by an angry orange
Cheeto if more people voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over half the country doesn't vote every
election.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just drives me insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like half the country has
felonies and can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the country decides it's unimportant
or their vote doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up with some other lame-ass
excuse to dodge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we end up with assholes who want to
be assholes getting to make all the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, well, my vote doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let me have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is you got to go do it for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, just listen to Mike and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vote matters to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that for us, even if you're not
doing it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my younger years, my non-parent years,
I would identify the people in my
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate social circle who were going to
come up with one of those ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just show up on election day and be
like, what up, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fill out that ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, get in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down to the polling place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing we got over the social
pleasantries when you got here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, buddy, how's life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, how are the kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're like, have you voted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you fill out your ballot yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: You totally got on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, sorry, Mike, there's one or two
I'm still thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, they word things so backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to Google it all just so you know
you don't vote against yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I love about the mail
ballot or the mail-in election is you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got your ballot at home for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all the time in the world to
sit down and go, okay, what does amendment
[SPEAKER_01]: want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I agree or not agree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what's amendment two?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does Billy Bob, what has he ever done
for Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I vote for him or should I vote for
fucking Jimmy Bob?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go through and check all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not some old lady in line behind
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not trying to get to work in a
minute or trying to get home from work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just do it in your off time at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't live in one of those
states, you can look everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be up on your ballot online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a picture of your ballot,
how it's going to look when you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: the voting booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing that says you can't
take a cheat sheet that says I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: vote this person for governor,
this person for treasurer against
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take your phone in there?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just write yourself a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could fully do it notes in your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Text yourself a note so that you have it
in your phone accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know where the text messages are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open that, read a text from yourself
and it says vote for this guy for
[SPEAKER_00]: governor, this guy for mayor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started doing this,
like you just had to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd get in there and you'd have the
little quarter paragraph of legalese and
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had to try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much easier now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least 30 million cannabis
consumers in the U S at least minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are a couple of times a year or
more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the hard data,
like 20 plus million of them are more like
[SPEAKER_01]: you and me, then they'd like to admit to
their parents or authority figure like
[SPEAKER_01]: their boss.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have any political cloud
anywhere until very recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still pretty piddly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you think of a group like the
NRA, like the NRA, they run politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come out against something they're
for, you're going to face endless attack
[SPEAKER_01]: ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shit show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to get involved in,
if you're in politics, they've got 4
[SPEAKER_01]: million members for as in one,
two, three, stop counting cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 million compared to four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at our influence
abilities, those numbers are reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: because they vote and they make sure
everybody knows they vote and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: really happy to be like, you know what I
did yesterday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna vote again in a different
election when it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not double voting because that'd be
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any, any chance I get, I'm going to
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every election.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Colorado does a thing now where I got
it a couple elections ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a thing after the election that was
like seven in a row, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that's a nice little
attaboy from our county clerk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but shout out to Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, do voting is pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't know anything about
politics, you've never seen your ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't watch the commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're clueless.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to vote in this election and
you want to do it in a way that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: idiotic and you want to be a little
informed about it, you're looking at half
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour with your smartphone from going
from totally uninformed, never heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: any of these people or any of these issues
to fully understand what I'm voting for
[SPEAKER_01]: and why I'm voting the way I'm voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at 30 minutes tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very much worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening from prohibition land
and you wonder how we got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got here because we convinced donors to
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we convinced our friends and
family to vote with us by talking to them
[SPEAKER_01]: about politics over dinner, which was
uncomfortable, just like you think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but this stuff's really, really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that drives me nuts about
our community is we've gotten really close
[SPEAKER_01]: to federal legalization a couple of times
in the not so distant past.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really close in 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were close again in 71.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were close again in 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: And near like the community doesn't come
together for anything other than a concert
[SPEAKER_01]: and or a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and a party or an event, but if we
came together even a little bit for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of elections in a row, we would run
the country top to bottom, coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be unparalleled with our ability to
fundraise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And message distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much of it is people being afraid
to stand up for something that could get
[SPEAKER_00]: them in trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much of it do you think is just
lack of participation because laziness or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever random excuse?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, there's so many people,
there's actually a huge chunk of politics
[SPEAKER_01]: is convincing you voting is pointless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I can convince you not to vote,
my vote doubles in impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every person I convinced not to vote,
I get their power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you convince someone not to vote,
building that into a habit is super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a shitload of people that are like,
no, one vote never changed anything or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all rigged or there's only two
parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I still run into people that think
Hillary and Trump were the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if even if you don't pay attention to
politics, it should be fucking obvious by
[SPEAKER_01]: now that shit would be different today if
we had gone a different way as a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, I'm a comedy fan, so it's
working out pretty well for me that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got Cheeto Bandito as our president.
Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we could just get even a little bit of
the community focused enough to regularly
[SPEAKER_01]: vote and see, I'm encouraging you to vote
if you're voting against me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause right now the people that vote
are angry and afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those two things, those two emotions
don't lead to rational decision making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people listening are probably,
they would agree with us politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to imagine I, I'm not going
to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it how you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we've gotten worldwide,
who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of us did not vote and look what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis community not voting is
why cannabis is still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't vote for local people,
your local rules always get chosen by
[SPEAKER_01]: people who don't agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't vote for statewide elections,
the statewide rules get created by people
[SPEAKER_01]: who don't agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't vote in national elections,
it's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that one person in
Alabama doesn't feel like their vote isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have the same kind of impact that
it would elsewhere, or it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: sway anything or change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But literally every single vote does
matter and does change shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mentality seems to hover in a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like the whole whatever,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff and his crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them are going to go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all talking about it in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if one guy can convince Jeff and his
crew, now you've got six people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: all like-minded that are going to go vote
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually six votes that you were
just all going to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can convince those people that
are at the throwaway, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can convince the leader of that
silly group, you can get a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: them to go all vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting people not to vote is by design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on where you are,
the design may look a little different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a reason there's deadlines for
registering to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some of these, for some states,
this was months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other states, you can register day of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states, you need two forms of state
issued ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other states, you don't need any ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states, depending on what your felony
crime was, you automatically get your
[SPEAKER_01]: voting rights back the second your case is
completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to vote for the five years
you're on parole or the three years you're
[SPEAKER_01]: incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once all that's done and you're just a
regular free person who did some time and
[SPEAKER_01]: is now a free free, you get your voting
rights back.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other states, you never get them back
at all, or you have to go through a long,
[SPEAKER_01]: insane process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a long, insane process that is also a
hundred percent arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't watch last week tonight with
John Oliver listeners, you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a great episode on some of this
voting rights stuff not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the fact that there are people
spending millions of dollars to convince
[SPEAKER_01]: you not to vote because you're young and
you like cannabis, doesn't that make you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to go vote?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spending fortunes to convince poor
people and minorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a member of anything that can be
considered a subculture, they don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: you to vote because the odds are you're
going to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your interests and not theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: This messaging has been so effective in
different communities and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community got hit hard with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the was the tune in dropout or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn on, drop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got taken way too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even people that are like more like me
than you took a look at a part of that to
[SPEAKER_01]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember a part of that,
of fighting it when I was in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know that I should vote and voting
is important and I should pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: politics, but fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to be any part of the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, I thought it was
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a waste of time to go
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends would go vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come back from, from school or from
lunch and they'd have that I voted sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'd be like, Hey, you wasted your
lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove around and fucking smoke bowls in
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I thought it was just a dumb thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I am old enough to see the
effects that the elections have either
[SPEAKER_00]: small or large elections, local or
national, I feel like I may have wasted a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of opportunity by not voting when I
was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably several years of my
life that I skipped voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a number of important elections
where we could have used your vote,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this has to stay true.
[SPEAKER_01]: This November 7th, we could see massive
cannabis turnout.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen that across the country
during recent elections where one side or
[SPEAKER_01]: the other really goes for the cannabis
vote, knowing that it's going to bring out
[SPEAKER_01]: young, more than likely liberal voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worked for some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't worked in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Pueblo County, the last election in
2016, when we elected Trump, we went for
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping the marijuana industry and for
Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a bunch of places around
the country that went for Trump and for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And watching the pundits the day after the
election.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know what the fuck happened,
but this is the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to watch, but at the same time,
a little bit terrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this election kind of has the same
feel to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of important shit on the
ballot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: North Dakota and I think Michigan are both
voting on legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen much from the
pro-legalization campaigns in those
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot from the anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization groups in those states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that's who I follow, not the
messaging on the ground, but that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: two states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's at least 10 voting on cannabis
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's got a hemp amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendment X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is kind of sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely encourage people who haven't
already voted in Colorado to really look
[SPEAKER_01]: at Amendment X before choosing yes or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of important shit on your
ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just marijuana stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Politicians too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I received, and I want to actually give a
shout out to a politician for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time ever on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't quite an endorsement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although cannabis community, the candidate
I'm about to mention is very pro-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and his opponent is very anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jared Polis of Colorado, who's
currently a senator and running for
[SPEAKER_01]: governor, I got a mailer two days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: One side of it is just a pretty nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it needed to be trimmed, but it was
just a nice nug on a high gloss print.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right out of fucking high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one fat bud that needed some scissor
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side, it outlined his
pro-cannabis stance and views for the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you guys can hear the dab
torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heating up the nail for Mike to hit
this CBD dab for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to start wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm fucking 36.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought I'd see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where a serious candidate for governor,
not a fringe candidate, not a Green Party
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate, but like one of the two who was
going to get it would put out something
[SPEAKER_01]: that pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blatantly, explicitly pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was pretty pro-cannabis for his
last Senate run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw anything like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big flame.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is your friendly reminder that
smoke burns, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke will burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke will burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the leftover oil in that nail
from not burning the dab last time from it
[SPEAKER_00]: being a little bit too cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll speak into the microphone like a damn
podcaster here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry listeners, for those of you who
aren't psychic and didn't see what we just
[SPEAKER_01]: saw, Jeff's heating the dab nail and my
weak lungs took a cool dab last time and
[SPEAKER_01]: left some residue in the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab the other torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's within reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: While Jeff was heating it up, it produced
a little cloud of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he moved that torch up a little bit,
the flame hit the smoke and produced the
[SPEAKER_01]: fireball the size of his dreadnought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke does burn, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a friendly reminder to keep a
spare dab torch or an extra can of tan
[SPEAKER_01]: around whenever you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know when a torch is going to
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That torch just quit lighting on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was bragging on it the other day saying
how good it is, and it just took a
[SPEAKER_00]: poo-poo, so we got to use the backup plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made that mistake with the wife the
other night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her, I was like, man, it's been
three nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the kids has slept all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you sure as shit, homie,
was up twice that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably within five minutes of you
saying that, that's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an hour and a half after I
said it, and then again at 5.30 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, when this nail is hot,
you've got about 50 seconds to give us
[SPEAKER_00]: your final thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got anything else to say,
yeah, if you've got anything else for the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, now's your chance to get it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote, vote, vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get a chance to vote this
election, you should feel like a piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit for at least three hours,
and then you can let that guilt go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But get registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not registered to vote,
it's super simple to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably do it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, a 15 minute visit to the DMV in
your area will get it cleared up in most
[SPEAKER_01]: places, unless you're black and in the
South.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, should I edit that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are huge porches in the country that
make it super hard for different groups to
[SPEAKER_01]: vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't at all mind somebody coming to me
in five years being like, do you remember
[SPEAKER_01]: when you said it was hard for black people
to vote in Alabama?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you feel like yelling at me for
that, it's at NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be one of the next things
I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab time, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Mike on all the
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws,
not Cannibal Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big difference than Cannibal
Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different, totally different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, this is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't follow the Cannibal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do follow the Cannibal Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your thing, I'm trying not to be
judgmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to embrace everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a Pueblo for
Sensible Cannibal Laws, but I'm wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: start it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a fun troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, support Mike's Facebook group,
Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more appetizing and it's not as
awkward to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave his mic on so you can
hear him cough over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow him on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is at NemoPunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is getting cross-eyed and small tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't focus them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I can't focus them and did little
eye movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did superstar eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot we were recorded there for half
an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got headphones and a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that CBD cherry flavor is just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I thought of giving you a dab of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listeners, thank you for listening this
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're still listening, we totally
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag, they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be a couple of days before I can
get back over here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely more grow lessons
coming after this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put a lot of grow lessons
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have been following the show,
I've been doing a long series of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me take a break on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting Mike hang out for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lessons will be back on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've made promises and set
expectations and I will meet those
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty much what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp farm was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference between hemp and
cannabis basically in Colorado is a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp CBD is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit acting like quit poo pooing hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great medicine for people who are in
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affordable and it's reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote, get off your ass and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're going to vote against us,
participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get out there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important that everybody votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculously important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all we got for today,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
