[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we've got people here from Texas

[SPEAKER_01]: There are ladies here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dudes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more ladies than men here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty rare for a cannabis club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaving the club right now is my good
buddy, Jason Margulies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be safe on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting to my right, I'm going to
introduce the man, the myth, the legend,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about yourself, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I am great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be at a club in Springs
where we could just take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This place has such a great vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely one of the first spots I
go to when I come down to the Springs now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm actually here now, so,
you know, the first places I go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing shows from here a
lot, I feel like, because this place has a
[SPEAKER_01]: great vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Camille for inviting me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the whole staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they treat me like a VIP when I show
up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard not to feel special when I come
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't turned a doorknob here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I show up, somebody opens a
door for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry my goodies in for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the sweetest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend Fox here, I know you mostly
as Fox.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably call you Foxy most of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are who I refer to as my CBD expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got a CBD question, I usually call
you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess what I should start with is,
can you tell my listeners a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about what CBD is?
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, just like THC, is a compound
cannabinoid in cannabis that is
[SPEAKER_02]: non-cyclical.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC is a psychoactive compound,
which obviously gives us a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that
has different qualities that THC doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of 138 found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: 138 cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know of maybe 12 or 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, PhD was sitting down with me and
telling me all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, go on, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tell me more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear about them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get that PhD guy on here one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring him next time.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC is the one that we all love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets us high, it gets us blazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said there is no psychoactive effects
to CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's more like a euphoric effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in high doses, you can get kind
of like an elevated euphoria, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing like a psychoactive effect where
you feel high per se.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being in Colorado, we're blessed to have
CBD available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke a lot of CBD myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a medical marijuana patient,
but I don't need the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to save it for the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did talk about it on one episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk a little bit later about the
effect that it had on myself and a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to hear more about,
so why are we going for the CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it really do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you so enthusiastic about CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, my story with CBD is a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long, but we've got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so in the long terms of it,
when I was young, you know, I'd lost a
[SPEAKER_02]: child to epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so your own child.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, it's fine, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm here and that's why I raise
awareness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my second child to epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very young when it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea about epilepsy at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, it it took me by storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a good seven year period where I
had went to a very confused place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It put strain on every relationship around
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that I continued to focus on at the
time was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea that it would bring me
round circle to something that I had dealt
[SPEAKER_02]: with and not really knew about what had
gone on until I met a parent going through
[SPEAKER_02]: something similar with their nonverbal
autistic child who was a cannabis patient
[SPEAKER_02]: in their state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started telling me all about the
wonders of how CBD is working for them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they have problems getting it,
problems obtaining it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD that they were getting was tainted
and making their child sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's from another country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had random shit in it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't know much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say this is two years ago that I,
you know, contacted other parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know what we know now and what
is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now definitely wasn't them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash that you brought today is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of that did you make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one of these, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of them are from companies that I
love to support, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can shout them out if you feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a little bit of a craft
concentrate as well as viola, live resin
[SPEAKER_02]: and some wonderful full malt extractions
from natural mystic caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some blueberry, cherry CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to make mix it up,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, usually if I run something,
it's out of my garden and it's first done
[SPEAKER_02]: into the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very limited on the, you know,
very limited small batch drops that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I rather just, you know, luckily in a
great place where a lot of our friends are
[SPEAKER_02]: in the community and the industry and
they're killing it at what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to support any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way you do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should let people know how they can
follow you on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they find you on Instagram and
Facebook while they're listening?
[SPEAKER_02]: On Facebook, I am Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fox and on Instagram I am at Foxtracks,
F-O-X-T-R-A-T-C-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check them out while we're talking,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go make sure you stalk them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coughing into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a big old fat dab of some
solvent a few minutes ago and I'm still
[SPEAKER_01]: sweating a little bit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off of, we got to give a shout out to Bear
Mountain Glass for the gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: What colors exactly are those?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that is my Bear Mountain Studios
custom one of one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raindrop and purple lollipop, Kleinda.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Klein, but it's kind of a Klein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he calls it a Kleinda.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I've kind of been calling
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of compliments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of got almost an egg sort of a
feel to it as well with the way that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hollow there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like a hollow honey jar of sorts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opals really do kick it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys follow me on Instagram,
it's iree underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will post a picture that I took a nice
picture of you guys, and I'm sure you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It on Fox's Instagram page, so go take a
look there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be resharing all those photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take a pic of that and take a pic of
us together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, man, that's why you've got the
passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I understand what put passion into
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you came out of nowhere and
you're winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, congrats on the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that Jason, who is actually
here, it was my material that I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ran it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran it together on a wonderful unit
that he had, I think a sweet leaf or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Caleb over there got the oil and
cranked it out into the award-winning
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate bar that it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny that you had all those
people in the room at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of in a room full of rock stars
and beautiful ladies right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could not have gone any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely give Caleb a little
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shumit bars, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's definitely cool with the CBD work
he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Shumit bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few left on the shelf down
there at the Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you how you can get a hold of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try the peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite was the banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that, a banana something you gave
me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the entry, the banana cream
pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked around just slow for the rest
of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It put a little slowness on my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oil that we used for it, it came back
testing out at 71.3% CBD, 10.95% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: so a really strong 7 to 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we cranked out and did the math
and he dosed it out, it came out to like
[SPEAKER_02]: 160 milligrams to that bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was almost the perfect
ratio for just literally having the
[SPEAKER_02]: calmest day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was calm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave some and donated some to some
autistic patients that were having some
[SPEAKER_02]: rage issues, pediatric nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, you know, it's hard to gate
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results that we were getting back
from the parents were almost immediate,
[SPEAKER_02]: saying just from a few chips of this
chocolate bar, they were getting calming,
[SPEAKER_02]: soothing effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really helping with those
serious anger conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that I could be rageful or
angry after eating that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just completely calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was walking around day two of the
cannabis cup, just in mellow mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bubble around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said that really helped the
autistic children with their rage.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other things does CBD help with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to educate my listeners a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get these guys up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD is a neuroprotectant, anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me pause for a second when I say
anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know that THC kills cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD freezes the cancer cell in its tracks
so it can't progress or grow any further,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it will not kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anti-cancer is freezing it at bay its
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically causes cell death in the
mutated cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that the tumors can't grow anymore,
but they remain where they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll still exist if they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use a conjunction of a high CBD,
high THC regimen, and with cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're bound to basically stop,
freeze, and kill those mutated cells and
[SPEAKER_02]: get back to a healthier way of living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD is a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously it's very popular with
epilepsy and other neurological diseases,
[SPEAKER_02]: Asperger's, autism, children on the
spectrum, Crohn's, PTSD, anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost anything that an adult would be
suffering from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take CBD for my headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even take any form of aspirin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have completely separated all that with
different regimens of CBD and THC and just
[SPEAKER_02]: a healthy cannabis regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeding that endocannabinoid system is
very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all as medical patients have our
own deficiencies in those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is one of those all around
protectants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the multivitamin of the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make a sticker out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Centrum sticker of cannabinoids.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does so much in different variations
and ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can help so many different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parkinson's, cerebral palsy, nerve damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In CBD itself, there's other spectrum of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN, CBG, CBC, that all have different
medical attributes that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive, get you high kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these is an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these is a antibacterial.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these is a bone regenerant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a CBG cream for a couple of
patients that have this rare disease
[SPEAKER_02]: called Keenbox disease, which is where a
bone in your wrist is basically dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came up with a salve that literally
supplies immediate relief for people that
[SPEAKER_02]: have had the surgery and have that pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to make that more readily
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should definitely sway some of the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage people that don't know a lot
about cannabis to listen to my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should sway them to believe a
little bit more in medical marijuana and
[SPEAKER_01]: the uses, the practical uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we're not just in this just to
get as high as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, a lot of us are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to take fat dabs and get wrecked,
but there is definitely medicinal value in
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actively use CBD in the part of my
regimen all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't just advocate it or do what we do
with the genetics and the breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: just everything in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally I know I'm happier with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm calmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a much more productive person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have going through some of the
things that I've gone through at a young
[SPEAKER_02]: age that kind of weighs on you a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it gets hard sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, as soon as I started enriching
my cannabis diet with CBD, I've noticed a
[SPEAKER_02]: wide spectrum of problems that I was
having day to day really kind of just have
[SPEAKER_02]: more control over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't let it get to me anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just find myself being incredibly
more productive when I have it in my
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I feel the same way about
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and I'm glad that we can sit here and
talk about that, because like yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're obviously a wonderful
advocate for THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends, Team Landon,
they care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Sierra.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they'll be coming back soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just did their New Year's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm stalking you guys on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're both beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the roomies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he cured his leukemia with THC
strong cannabis, though he started with
[SPEAKER_02]: the realm of caring, which is obviously
known for Charlotte's Web and the strong
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the CBD oil, which he actually wasn't
even using for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they use it as a supplement
because they noticed it was stopping what
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemo is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they made it very they were very
adamant that THC is what killed and
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped his leukemia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, shoot, it's been,
I think, over six months since he's had a
[SPEAKER_02]: clean bill of health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No forced state chemo anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: State forced chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the tests have come back completely
negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He still maintains a healthy regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sierra maintains his caregiver and we
oversee, you know, all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen what both sides of it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, though,
we advocate for our different compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: our different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole plant cannabis is what I think is
best all around the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Team Landon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to hear that he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They play this episode for me,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I put them up by the iPhone and let
them hear this, Judy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to hear this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever need anything, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs is so neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking a minute ago about how the
medical community here has united because
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the there's not as greedy
of a vibe in cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking up at the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of people just hanging
out in line just waiting to get a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got people up there whipping up dabs
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pressing up rosin and everyone's
just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys come on down to the can of candy
and get a dab with us one of these nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely come by.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a CBD dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So earlier you told me we talked a little
bit before we hit record.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we hung out and got comfortable,
took a bunch of dabs together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were telling me that you made
extracts before you even grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole thing started as me just being
a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just made oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of devalues what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand the term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we were, whatever the case was,
it started one way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started becoming clear that we
couldn't control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only control so much of what you
make because it's all in your starting
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to start controlling the type
of medicine that I was making instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: just processing other people's material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's hit or miss, you have some
people that put their love and their
[SPEAKER_02]: everything into their material and it
shows when you end up pulling it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got guys that put their fluoramide
and everything else into their oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most wonderfully nice way I can
put it to start off this new year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so started processing the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Found out that I kind of really love doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut back to my roots in chemistry and just
little things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing what people are doing with
distillation even a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing how we're coming along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're still a budding baby
industry in the can of chemistry world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's amazing to see what we're doing
now with technology that's been around for
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have these wonderful new ways
and freedoms to apply these new
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great to see what these guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are coming out with new
extraction techniques, whether it's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: solventless world or whether we're using
non-polar solvents or whatever the case
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's exciting to see across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the things you make?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you make a bunch of different
types of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run us through the list of what you can
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've made suppositories for some
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made dog CBD biscuits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also made one-to-one treats for the
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our old canine friends have fatty
tumors or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, poor dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do what we can and started coming up
with some solutions to try to help those
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people, those parts of our family
that we love.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a few myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from there, salves, balms, different
ratios of capsules for a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: From everyday cannabis regimens for a
normal medical patient to an extended
[SPEAKER_02]: hospice patient where what we do at that
point is make them as comfortable as we
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: These patients are in the excess of taking
anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis a day to make them comfortable
because that's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're able to produce that reliably
for these people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's commendable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that we do, we make per
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's specifically per.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nothing minus the salve that
I've talked about, the CBG salve,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then any collaborations that we've
done with friends like Caleb or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that are things that are even close
to being mass produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is small batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is individually made per
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done cannabis saline infusions as
well for those children that have to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: through G-tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done... You guys are thinking of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've done some medicated lubricants
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done... Those work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, different concentrates,
water extracted, butane extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the white CBD stuff I've seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isolate, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends team Landon have a company
called Landon's Health Hut, and they work
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lab here in the States that
produces this hemp-derived 99.57% CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, she started telling me about it,
and I was very skeptical, and I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we got in touch with the
lab, and I found out that they were using
[SPEAKER_02]: American Source Hemp, and they kind of
walked us through the process of
[SPEAKER_02]: distillating and then crystallizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it just made it sound like it's a
simplified process, but it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of getting the right
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you said you've got a chem background,
so for you it probably is just basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I skim the pond with the rocks at times,
but what catches really catches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through a lot of trial and error,
you will learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this industry is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trial and error is your friend,
and that's how I do everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to focus and don't get anything out
until it's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the series of things, I can really
only think of one little thing that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever gone through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through making edibles for someone,
I learned my mistakes and putting flaxseed
[SPEAKER_02]: in there, because some people are very
susceptible to that allergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I can't think of what
we make has really helped a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: across the board for all the different
ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stay away from alcohol extractions as
far as RSO, any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because we mostly started with
pediatric epileptic patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medications that they have to take for
the most part, even trace amounts of that
[SPEAKER_02]: could affect and totally just give them a
huge variety of complications with their
[SPEAKER_02]: medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also very hard on their digestive
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Children that are going through chemo,
children that have autism, children that
[SPEAKER_02]: have epilepsy, they all have compromised
immune systems and compromised digestive
[SPEAKER_02]: systems in their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the problems that I've seen with
pediatric patients using RSO is that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have problems holding down that medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started going around and promoting
different carrier oils, different ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: taking this non-solvent or solvent extract
and decarboxylating and putting it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthier carrier oil for these children.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's an example, maybe coconut oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Avocado oil, coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone is diabetic and they want to
try a healthier route, there's always hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: seed oil, which is the healthiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's protein juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely wonderful for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll always say hemp seed oil first,
if not avocado oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grape seed oil is another wonderful
example of something you can use other
[SPEAKER_02]: than coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people are very happy with
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it works, then it works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people are on the coconut
oil cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be real popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first questions with that is if they're
a Crohn's patient or a diabetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask them right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transparency is everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This knowledge is all open source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more you can be open with the
patient and explain it to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more they leave knowing at the end of
the day, the better it is in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about going to
dispensaries and maybe to medical shops
[SPEAKER_01]: and teaching the bud tenders this sort of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely think there's a really
important part in people bud tenders
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically getting some form of
education because a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be very blunt when I say this,
a lot of them look at it as just a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them come in looking at it as the
retail job.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of retail aspects to what it
is because it is a point of sale system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, you're dealing
with medical patients and what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: providing, what you're helping sell is a
medical product based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be taken seriously like a
medical industry like we're trying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should take the time with the medical
patient as required.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone ever got too mad at a
bud tender for knowing too much proper
[SPEAKER_02]: information about their meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a bud tender and I've annoyed a
few people with my weed nerd skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you tend to feel them out and people
that are just there for what they want are
[SPEAKER_02]: there for just what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those curious patients that come in
and they have genuine real questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: things that they don't know, it's always
wonderful to have somebody there that
[SPEAKER_02]: knows what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make them feel more welcome and more
often than not you build wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: business relationships with your patients
and they feel comfortable coming back and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting their medicine from people that
actually know and care about what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather go eat at the restaurant where
the guy remembers me and remembered,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you liked this last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to go back where you built a
relationship and aren't treated like
[SPEAKER_01]: customer number seven for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you say you don't make a Rick Simpson
oil type of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an alternative?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally will infuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the oils that we make in
comparison are either infused with hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: seed oil, the tincture per se,
or we crank the ratios out with raw,
[SPEAKER_02]: veganic hemp seed or grapeseed oil or
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll use that as the carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen, I can get the dosage
almost down to similar to what it would
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your body is going to love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that black tar, that black sludge
is super hard for our bodies to digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people get nauseous and change
colors from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people still eat that stuff raw and I
don't understand how they can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, so we're just trying
to find better ways of easier ways for
[SPEAKER_02]: this to get into our system and healthier
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick Simpson was an innovator for what he
did, but now knowing what we know about
[SPEAKER_02]: NAFTA and the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we're at a different place now
medically, so we know better and we should
[SPEAKER_02]: provide that to our patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like your integrity on that aspect.
No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing to knock about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing but respect for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about you started making
hash before you started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you end up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you weren't satisfied with the
material that was around, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cali in the Bay was kind of,
people were on that cookies trip a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was all about the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the CBD flower that was coming
out was looking like grass clippings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to be mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the CBD heavy plants are not as easy
to grow as some of the more THC or Citivo
[SPEAKER_01]: or Indica dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're recognizing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder and a grower, I recognize
that heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like CBD dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a grower that started out just growing
CBD dominant plants, the first time I
[SPEAKER_02]: popped some seeds that were THC dominant,
I was like, this is really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the curve now and you just took
off the training wheels and wanted to fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The curves that I had to deal with for
growing the CBD were not what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with growing some very wonderful
THC genetics that I had been gifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, oh my God,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those CBD plants will harm on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grow very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be happy all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your ratios will be affected severely if
there's any sort of stress during the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative state whatsoever, because that
CBD is already there in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: state before it's been flipped or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People often completely overlook their veg
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched people build $10,000 flower
rooms and spend six or 800 bucks just
[SPEAKER_01]: fixing up a shitty old bedroom to make a
veg space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, come on, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's like you said, that's where
the plant starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The starting stage of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing from seed, you obviously
want to flex your tapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make your plants as sturdy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good strong adolescence before you put
them in that adult room.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that with CBD plants the very
hard way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time something happened,
I would call one of my friends and be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, look, this is what I'm going
through, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank, I just want to say
this now, and if it's okay if I shot them
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Offer Chronic Genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Clancy has been one of the most
standup guys that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have free CBD seeds in my book
bag from him right now that I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: remembering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will gladly donate free CBD seeds to
anyone that wants them right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope people in this room heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll gladly say it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he's been a wonderful,
wonderful friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Josh from La Plata Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, yeah, every breeder, every person
that I've talked about what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with CBD has been completely open
source with me and helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any little thing that I, it's
literally fast tracked me so much that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, I'm completely grateful
for the knowledge that's been dropped on
[SPEAKER_02]: me because it took me from trying to
provide for my patients and struggling to
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing things that I just would have
never grasped before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I said, it's I'm truly
grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I started as an extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just took one of my friends getting
screwed over basically for me to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what, dude, I'll grow for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Became very public about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started growing,
my problem was people hoard these or they
[SPEAKER_02]: were hoarding these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, well, let's share them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, you know, let's pull cuts and,
you know, give them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you can only help as many people as
you can get this cut out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is something I'll touch into later,
but my main source was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, let's make this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my time in Cali, people were on this
crazy cookies craze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going from NorCal to SoCal and
really in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: no hits at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: No progress whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California is where I fell in
love with a wonderful plant called Sour
[SPEAKER_02]: Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met an amazing group of breeders in
the Emerald Triangle that changed my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were already caregivers for some of
the children in the state going through
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: These men showed me what real compassion
was at the very starting point when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: in this industry and blessed me with some
genetics and knowledge and pointing me in
[SPEAKER_02]: the right directions of things for what I
wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they have a name to shout out,
like a crew name or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ringo, you know, he's no longer with us,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spirit lives on, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of them, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they hear this, they know who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the kind hearted people who don't
do this for the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just do this for the sake of
continuing to push cannabis forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for the sake of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've got my respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these people in NorCal, you find this
crew in NorCal and you fall in love with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find Sour Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start growing that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started asking questions, started doing
runs with the plant specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people start talking about this
plant, this, you know, because at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, even in California, there was such a
hype about Colorado and Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_02]: and what it really was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these guys in California had no
clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you had these streams popping up
like Sour Tsunami and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, well, it's just like Sour Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you had Harlequin popping up in
Harborside down by Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the stronger three to
one, two to ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing like Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this ACDC plant started to come
around, you know, and people just started
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing them because no one knew as all
these new strains started coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that from Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a Colorado strain, the ACDC?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wondered where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it started in Spain,
from what I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, it started in
Spain and somehow made its way to
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from that's just from what I
understand, from what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as our Colorado CBD
strains, you know, R4, R5, the RU5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torobora is well known around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torobora, Torsu, you know, the work that
Natural Mystic Caregivers down here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: springs of down the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blueberry Sue, the Harlequin Sue,
the Blueberry Ox, the Canna Sue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all those are absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Natural Mystic for they're
one of the only shops that really focuses
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find three or four different kinds
of top shelf flower that are CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually one of my favorite places in
the springs to go to for CBD flower
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, I support any place
that will put good CBD products on their
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the growers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Joey pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was I going to ask?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about labs that getting
your stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a lab that you prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is a friend of ours that has
an independent lab and he really does help
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people with low cost testing and
does his part to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Colorado law is made a little
hard for caregivers, patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: parents to have their meds tested because
obviously most labs are forced to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with people that have MIPS licenses,
whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are those few independent people
who have taken it upon themselves with
[SPEAKER_02]: their own dollar to provide a place where
patients can have their meds tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually a place like that
down here in the springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have all the information,
so I don't want to shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nate knows who he is and he's definitely
killing it down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I get more information,
I'll gladly pass along your way and we can
[SPEAKER_02]: share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll get it out to the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who did the testing for the
Cannabis Cup entry that Caleb and I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done some other testing for the oil
that I've done before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers have always come spot on
to the point where if I go somewhere else
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like my numbers aren't right,
I go to Nate because my numbers are right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can count on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Cannabis Cup is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's January.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys were recording in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds so weird to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to do anything for the Cup
this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some few plans for the Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm keeping myself open right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that they split up SoCal for the
two weekends was a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, that is why we kind of backed
out of doing anything so quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had some things going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you know, with whatever happens
in Denver, we'll have a showing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is something in California that
is calling my attention that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few people reach out, you know,
you never know what collabs you might see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Queen Bee Extracts,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was the CBD winner for Chalice,
I believe, and won.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's doing great things out there in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you support the Chalice
Festival, you guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Man Glass Dougie is the sponsor of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like definitely looking forward to
seeing what will come to fruition between
[SPEAKER_02]: now and Cup season, as we all know what
that refers to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five days this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's one more day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either the Friday before or the
Wednesday at the end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Denver?
[SPEAKER_01]: For Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because 420 is on a Wednesday,
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either Tuesday or Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just stretching it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm incredibly excited for whatever
they want to do for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know that the MED has their
feelings about how cannabis events should
[SPEAKER_02]: be and what they are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a huge opposition to a lot
of the way that these events are run.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your two cents, if I can ask
personally, on how that goes here for
[SPEAKER_02]: people like us that obviously have
companies and promote within, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who enjoy these events?
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does for me is I work for a
MED-regulated dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't take my seed company and set up
a booth because I'm affiliated with that
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary so closely that I'll be fined.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dispensary will be fined if I'm there
selling products or giving products out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get your MED badge, that's part
of what you sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel that dispensaries... This is
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're allowed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone there is 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in an enclosed area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be able to... The dispensary
should be able to go and set up a booth
[SPEAKER_01]: and show our wares just like any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have beer festivals where... I'm not
going to name any beer brands,
[SPEAKER_01]: but whatever brand A, B, and C bring their
beer truck, they set up beer, they serve
[SPEAKER_01]: it to people all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shut down whole blocks to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whole blocks of downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this at a private event area
at the... I forget the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're renting a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even doing it on the city
blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the dispensary should be able
to come, set up a booth and bring smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoke you and I out and everybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should say, this is our flagship
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be fully allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of crap that it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to get your two cents on that
because being an independent caregiver on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other side of it, I don't necessarily
have to answer to them, but at some point,
[SPEAKER_02]: we cross paths and things are mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting for people that are
running within that model in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_02]: how that affects us for trying to actively
promote at events like this without being
[SPEAKER_02]: threatened with fines or whatever the case
may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fines and your business closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big enough fine... Green and Healthy is
a small business, just a few of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large enough fine would end us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be pretty careful on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't even risk it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish you guys all the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys open this whole week for the
software?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that working?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're officially open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this will come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're open today, but this will come out
in like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be full on open.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you guys hear this,
I will have checked them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he will.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be back to give you guys a review on
what he thinks of the Turbex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come check out the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of cool rigs there and
some stuff you'd want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took some notes, but I think I've gone
through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I love how cool Colorado Springs is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have one of these in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of chill to be able to
come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there may be one, but it's real low
key and I haven't gone there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's open yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as it opens, I'll go check it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's just hanging out, having a good
conversation, taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cloudy as shit in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's an incredibly cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just let us come hang out and do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can get Camille's attention to
come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't hear me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bug her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's being social.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a great host here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone here is super gracious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love coming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be here a lot more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, bro, we've been going for like
40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything else that you want to
throw out to the world about CBD while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're on a microphone?
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you forgot anything, you'll have
another opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started this company because obviously
something happened to me, to somebody that
[SPEAKER_02]: I can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is to help as many people as I can
because if you know that feeling of not
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to help someone but then are
put in a position where you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: why not?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every day I encourage people to
learn something new about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage people to take up a cause
that's close to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's epilepsy awareness and I will
talk about it until my face turns blue and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know more about epilepsy than you did
before we started talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that being said, that's my main focus
with everything that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that anything in the
iRegenetics lineup is always available to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there are a lot of people out
there doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do need my help, you let me
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that from the bottom of my
heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back at you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a great way to wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
