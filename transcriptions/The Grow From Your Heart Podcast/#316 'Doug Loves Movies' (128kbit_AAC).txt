[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back podcast world it's time for
episode 316 a quick Thursday episode you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I'm smoking on I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been taking dabs of sour kosher live resin
full spectrum extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: green dot labs the stuff is delicious it
kind of smells like dirty feet with diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel poured over it and I really like it
it sounds disgusting but it is so good I
[SPEAKER_00]: took a big old dab of it and it just made
my head go in slow motion everything just
[SPEAKER_00]: went so it's gonna be nice and calm should
be a pretty good podcast all right guys
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I want to mention before we get
into the show I know that the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers were out of order what happened
was I recorded the Monday episode I put it
[SPEAKER_00]: up I was like that'll come out Monday
everything will be cool it had a number it
[SPEAKER_00]: was number 314 then I decided hey let's
record a Sunday episode for moms on
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother's Day I labeled that one 315
because that's what my brain does it went
[SPEAKER_00]: in order I didn't think about it I put
that one out on Sunday 315 came out on
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday 314 came out on Monday sorry the
numbers got out of order a few people have
[SPEAKER_00]: tweeted me I've gotten a couple of emails
I know it's wrong you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: message me anymore I'm not gonna fix it
we're at episode 316 nothing went wrong we
[SPEAKER_00]: are okay but hey thanks to everybody who
messaged me and tried to keep me updated
[SPEAKER_00]: and let me know that I got out of order I
appreciate that anyway moving forward here
[SPEAKER_00]: we are episode 316 I want to talk a little
bit about what I got to do this weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorite comedians is Doug
Benson and of course Doug and I have kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of become buddies over the past few years
since I've gone to so many of his shows
[SPEAKER_00]: and interacted with them so much every
year Doug Benson comes to ComedyWorks in
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown Denver and does a lot of live
taping of his podcast called Doug Loves
[SPEAKER_00]: Movies Doug Loves Movies is a podcast all
about movies and movie trivia Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: encourages the audience members to make
name tags it's not like a name tag that
[SPEAKER_00]: would say hi my name is Rasta Jeff but
it's more like a movie poster idea the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea is that you print a movie poster and
you replace a word in the movie title with
[SPEAKER_00]: your name and then replace one of the
characters in the movies face with your
[SPEAKER_00]: face and possibly add Doug Benson and
whoever you think one of the guests on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shows may be you swap their faces with the
guest face and your face and Doug's face
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a custom poster like maybe you
might have a poster that says Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Strikes Back and you've taken out you've
put Rasta Jeff's face right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of it so it's Rasta Jeff Strikes Back
swinging a big lightsaber looking like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jedi that's pretty cool so that's the idea
you bring name tag posters and then Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: has three comedian guests that join him on
stage and they come out and they select a
[SPEAKER_00]: name tag from the audience name tags and
they are playing for that person so if the
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrity wins then the person whose name
tag they have selected wins the prizes
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from a prize bag so that's sort
of the idea behind what the the name tags
[SPEAKER_00]: the prizes and then there are games that
happen and Doug plays random movie trivia
[SPEAKER_00]: games based on whatever he feels like
doing that night and whatever he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: lined up for the show so that's how Doug
Benson show happens that's what Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson's show is I know that I'm gonna get
the opportunity to smoke before and or
[SPEAKER_00]: after the show with Doug Benson so I
rolled up five 10 gram raw cones so I had
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of 10 gram joints ready to smoke
at all times I had a couple in my pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: at all times in case something came up and
of course we so I met my buddy I picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend Baker and Baker and I drove to
ComedyWorks from downtown Denver Baker
[SPEAKER_00]: lives a little off of downtown we drove to
downtown Denver parked in the parking
[SPEAKER_00]: garage then we met up with my friend Brett
Mary's motivation on Instagram we may have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a little bit stoned then we headed
into ComedyWorks around 415 we decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: go outside of ComedyWorks and go smoke I
was carrying one of those raw cones in the
[SPEAKER_00]: package it was in the little the raw cones
come in a package so that they're sold the
[SPEAKER_00]: the rolling paper without any cannabis is
sold in this cone shaped package so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper doesn't get destroyed I just
rolled the joint and put it back in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I was walking out of the Comedy
Club just carrying that and a lighter so
[SPEAKER_00]: it was kind of obvious what was about to
go happen and I looked behind me and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was my self and Brett and my friend Baker
and another guy that I had seen before
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere but I wasn't sure who the hell
he was and then it dawned on me I said hey
[SPEAKER_00]: you're Decker Doom and he goes yeah
brother and he shook my hand it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend who had been watching my Instagram
feed and we became Instagram friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: he told me he was gonna be at the show and
I said hey if you see me come introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself he was smart enough to see me and
my crew go walking out the back door of
[SPEAKER_00]: the club at 415 and thought I should
probably follow those boys and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: smart because we went out there and smoked
a 10 gram joint and there weren't very
[SPEAKER_00]: many people out there the people who were
out there were pretty damn cool so anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: we finished smoking our joint and we go
back inside everybody gets comfortable I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out perfectly because right as we
walked in our food and drinks were
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered to our table to our seats it was
it was perfect timing it couldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: been any better we sat there for just a
couple of minutes I had time to pound down
[SPEAKER_00]: my snack and then the lights went out and
the comedy show started so it was Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: loves movies so Doug comes out and he
tells Joe and sets up the show you know
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few minutes he talks about where
he's gonna be for the next few weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: tells all of his Doug plugs and just kind
of hangs out with the audience and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: brings out his guests about five or ten
minutes into the show his guests this time
[SPEAKER_00]: were a comedian named Jacob Seroff who is
known for traveling with Doug and doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: few Doug loves movies podcasts he's kind
of a regular there was another comedian by
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of Dan Cheeseman who is a
semi-regular on the podcast and he is not
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cheeseman from Cheeseman parks if you
guys listen to the podcast there's plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of jokes about that all the parks in
Denver are called Cheeseman lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses called Cheeseman something he
is not that Dan Cheeseman then also
[SPEAKER_00]: another comedian by the name of John Toll
who I've seen before at ComedyWorks John
[SPEAKER_00]: Toll is a funny dude he's got a CD
available that was recorded at the
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown location of ComedyWorks he did a
really good job of sitting in with the two
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-regulars it was his first time on the
podcast Doug likes to bring a hometown
[SPEAKER_00]: hero if you will to be on the show he
picks a local comedian and lets them be on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show that way we feel like we've got
sort of a connection you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our players is on the stage so Doug
likes to do that I feel like John Toll
[SPEAKER_00]: held his own and fit in very well with the
other comedians so let's see where should
[SPEAKER_00]: I go from here let's give some shout outs
I want to give a shout out to Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_00]: after every show I've ever been to Doug
has taken time to come outside and meet
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who wants to meet him if you want
to take a picture with Doug he'll be out
[SPEAKER_00]: there you can go smoke a joint take a
picture with Doug Benson he doesn't mind
[SPEAKER_00]: he's friendly he's cool as shit so shout

to everybody at ComedyWorks you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks treats me like royalty they
say that I'm a regular and I don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I go there often enough to be a
regular but if they're gonna treat me like
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to take it I feel like they
treat everybody super well ComedyWorks is
[SPEAKER_00]: a super cool club if you've never gone to
a comedy show and I've said this before go
[SPEAKER_00]: to a comedy club even if you can't go to
ComedyWorks even if you can't go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy store in LA go to the comedy club
where you are support local comedy it's
[SPEAKER_00]: funnier than you think and if you don't go
to the comedy club it'll disappear because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody went to it and then one day you'll
say man I wish we could get Joey Diaz to
[SPEAKER_00]: come around here and I'll say damn it you
used to have a comedy club and you never
[SPEAKER_00]: went to it and now you like Joey and now
you want him to come and you fucked up and

[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm supposed to do that not sure if
that episode this episode will get taken
[SPEAKER_00]: down or something because I'm using part
of Doug's podcast Doug and I are friends
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't ask for permission or
anything because I feel like if I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: part it'll be worth it hey guys one of my
favorite podcasts is the Doug loves movies
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast I highly suggest that you listen
to Doug loves movies if nothing else
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to the recent episode from Denver
and hear them talk shit to me a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: times but you'll enjoy it it's a great
show find an episode with Mark Wahlberg

I'm gonna do is I'm gonna wrap up the show
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do all my shoutouts and my
advertising and then I'm going to play a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of seconds I'm not sure how long it
is I'm gonna play the clip from the Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: Benson live taping in Denver of the Doug
loves movies podcast where Jacob Seroff
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking attacked me from the stage you

[SPEAKER_00]: fun and games he was smiling the whole
time but when he walked out on stage he
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately went to talking shit right to
me it was fun we've met before and he came
[SPEAKER_00]: up to me right after and he's like dude
you know I was joking right and before he
[SPEAKER_00]: could even walk out of the comedy club I
knew he would come around the corner so I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing an Instagram live feed as soon
as he came out and I went like a news
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter I was like this guy Jacob Seroff
