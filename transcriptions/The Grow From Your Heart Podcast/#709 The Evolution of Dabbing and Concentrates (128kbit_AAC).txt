[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we made it through the intro
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode, you guys will be the 710
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about live rosin,
about making rosin, about pressing rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: at home, about growing specifically for
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have our friends Pedro from Pedro's
Grow Room, Mr. Rosin's neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin is legal fuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we've got another amazing
concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Rosin Ryan will be on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought since the next episode is the
710 show, this should be kind of the warm
[SPEAKER_00]: up for the 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focused mainly on making concentrates on
the next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one will be about how we got to this
point in the concentrate world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm going to evolve right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado here, and I feel like I
was kind of on the forefront, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the forefront in the scene,
if you will, of the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there when some of the very first
concentrates were put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: First things were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try some of the very first new
products that people had never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends were making live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the innovators of the official
inception of live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, they were pulling the live
rosin out of the obi dose machine and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it before it was even purged or
completely processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a special name for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking that stuff, but I started by
smoking some funky brown goop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been around since a part
of the evolution of concentrates here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, this new dab evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is that old bubble hash,
the old stuff that the older, the pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, the funky hash, the older guys like
the old clientele that come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary always ask for old bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been bubble hash around,
but since the evolution, since
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and medical cannabis
concentrates and dabs have really evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me step in and correct myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to talk about proper terminology
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, I keep saying dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab is actually a verb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing is a verb.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab is kind of a unit of measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase dab came from, I would get my
dabber, the little tool in which I would
[SPEAKER_00]: scoop up my concentrate onto my dabber so
I could put it onto my nail to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of concentrate that it would
take to get me properly medicated was a
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the phrase dab came into this
whole game, it was basically a unit of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the term, the word has been used very
broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a, it's like a Coke,
any kind of a soda, a carbonated beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: in a can is now called a Coke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how dab has been
bastardized into the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay, but I just want to clear up
some things here so that we're all on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab is basically a unit of measurement
or an amount of concentrate to be smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, do you have any dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken any dabs today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could use a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of the way it should be said.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, can I buy any dab from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really the way that would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab is kind of a unit of measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple doses would be some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you get what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we should really be saying is dabs
are concentrates or basically hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the older audience will be more
familiar with the word hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hash is a cannabis concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taken the valuable, the useful,
the medicinal part of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have stripped it from the green leafy
vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green part, the flower part,
that is a carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what grew the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes is where the potency is
hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are where the potency is
hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should have said it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have discovered methods and ways to
remove those trichomes from the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we are concentrating those trichomes,
that potency, that the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things are esters, palates,
a lot of other things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly we're going for the potency,
the trichomes, the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are what we're mainly after in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are concentrating that into a smaller
form and removing the leafy material that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do not need to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not horses, we're not rabbits,
we don't need the green leafy matter like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to smoke trichomes, resin glands,
cannabinoids, terpenes, that is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: are after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've discovered how to remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do it through,
you can do it through just, what is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, not when the crystals,
those crystals, the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the crystals fall off the weed in
your grinder, you are making dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, but kind of, that is
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is concentrated trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you press that into a puck or roll it
into a ball or simply scoop it on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: your bowl, that'll get you extra buzz
because that is a little concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome, a little concentrated THC on
those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get you extra buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also fancier ways of making dry
sift hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a bunch of trim or a bunch of weed
in a sieve bag with a certain size micron
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, beat the shit out of it for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the trichomes fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green leafy matter is left in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another very popular method to do
this is by using water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be educated in the next episode on
using ice and water to remove trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the green leafy matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, water is not being used as a
solvent, is being used as an agitator,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mechanical separator, not as a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a different, when they say
solventless, yes, that is still
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have discovered how to do
it simply by squishing a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can squish a bud and you can make
concentrates out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will make bubble hash out
of the bubble bags, take that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: squish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes really nice rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another very popular way,
another thing that has evolved rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me touch on CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we can make concentrates with
hexane, propane, CO2, all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the technical term for what
I'm trying to say here, but it's possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to make concentrates with many other
gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I am most familiar with,
what I think is most commonly used,
[SPEAKER_00]: is butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not teach you how to make butane
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not talk too much about that
because it is dangerous and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you are, I do not need to lead you
down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of avenues for you to
learn how to do that if that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred method of making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about, I'm way off of my
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where I am, but we were going
to talk about, I was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual terms here, wasn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most popular is butane concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in my opinion, the most popular here
in Colorado is probably the butane
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get shatter, if you get batter,
if you get diamonds, if you get sauce,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time those were extracted with
butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other most popular is the fresh
frozen, the live rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price differences in butane hash and
rosin are astronomical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to cover the terminology
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a dab is a dose, a hit of a
concentrate, of some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take those trichomes and we pull
it off of the plant and we use either
[SPEAKER_00]: water, agitation, butane, heat,
however we achieve that process,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have now made hash or a concentrate is
basically what we've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've concentrated that potency into one
smaller amount and now you need less of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to achieve the recreational or
medical dose which you now desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically dab and what a dab is
and what a concentrate is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the act of taking a dab is known as
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you called and I had a dab on the
dabber and I was putting that on the nail
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rig, I know that's a lot of
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you called me right now and he said,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, I am dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I had some people over and we're
just sitting on the couch watching videos
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking dabs in a group and he called
me or texted me and said, what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've got the terminology down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro will touch on that also in the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to make sure to cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know where we are on this podcast
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about concentrates,
dabbing, dabs and the evolution of such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should start off kind of by
talking about how I got into real
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, real BHO concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first dab, maybe I'm going to talk
about my first pre dab and my first real
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll talk about my first group
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to change my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just got an idea, not even going
to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will edit the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My notes have been annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not forget one of the stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to tell one detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put in this show one more
avenue of rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to add to the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one of the first times I
got real dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I was smoking concentrates with
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, before then we all would get random
shit that we thought was hash or bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash or whatever people would sell us or
give us when we were younger until this
[SPEAKER_00]: time period, I hadn't ever been stoned or
high or a DTF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that stands for dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never been DTF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, like I was on this occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about my first experience
acquiring some BHO, some butane,
[SPEAKER_00]: honey oil, some butane extracted
concentrate and my experience right around
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that medical marijuana was
becoming super popular in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had to be, uh, 2007, 2008,
maybe 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timelines are weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's all blurry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, around that timeframe,
I was doing, um, business.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happened a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing business with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the most amazing sour diesel that
money could buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get in the car with it and everyone
would be like, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you light it up and your eyes would
itch and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude, I was getting some sour diesel
from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a weekly visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go get an ounce of sour D from this
guy and try to make it last a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would never fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day I get some sour D from my buddy
and he passes me just a little folded
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a half a dollar size piece
of parchment paper folded in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside of that parchment paper was some
goopy golden stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave it to me and he goes,
hit that when you get home and let me know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got home and I had time to look at
what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unfolded it and I realized this is that
BHO stuff I've been hearing about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that butane honey oil that I've
been hearing about like in magazines and
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing other people in Denver and shit
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard somebody talk about this recently
and they said they got so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't handle themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm really curious about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a little teeny tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it would have been maybe, maybe a fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then it was several dabs,
but now that would have been maybe one fat
[SPEAKER_00]: dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take pretty monstrous dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't have been much now,
but back in the day, that was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took, I got a little scraper tool,
like a pipe cleaner tool, just something
[SPEAKER_00]: to scrape it up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gathered some of it off the
parchment and I didn't have a proper way
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really have, there were no,
I didn't have a dab tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know I was going to be
dabbing, so there was no dab equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a little tiny pipe that was brand
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a gift from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent some money at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw me a glass pipe as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a little tiny chunk of weed in the
bottom of the bowl just to cover the hole
[SPEAKER_00]: like a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a new pipe, that new hole
is too fresh in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a chunk of weed, maybe one
calyx, maybe it was one bract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stuffed that in the hole to work as a
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took half of that little glob of,
it wasn't even a glob, it was half of a
[SPEAKER_00]: big dab of the BHO concentrate and just
smeared it on top of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I sat at my desk and I was supposed
to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that new Sauer diesel in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to go smoke with friends and
go do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, I took a lighter and I hit
that BHO just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took one good hit to where I got a
nice lungful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it hit my lungs, my brain went,
oh, oh, oh, we're going to get high,
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were going to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get high, high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lungs went whoo, whoo, whoo,
whoo, whoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blew it out and a cloud came out and I
changed colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from my desk chair, zombie mode,
to my bed, face down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember having the most vivid dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes were still bloody red and I was
hungry as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to text my buddy and I was like,
bro, was that BHO or did you give me
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, bro, that's BHO and I made
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, how much more do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to share that with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to share that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a little while there, we were
smoking BHO on bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing it all wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I got high as shit, but we were not
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to find the proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads me to my second dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that after I adjust this
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera has been corrected,
hopefully through the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only notice because I just told you,
let's talk about my second dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I cannot recall which year this
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first year of the cannabis
cup in Denver, in Colorado at the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the little tiny place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Xdo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little tiny, tiny place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so crowded in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time that several years later,
it got super crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this time it was perfectly packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to park down the block a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty hyped up because it was a
cannabis cup, a high times event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we walked around that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked weed with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are offering dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, we saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a person with me and I was like,
you want to go and hit a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, she was like, sure, let's try
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got in line for the booth at
Broadway wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, big D Daniel
DeSye, uh, the secret cup, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: top shelf extracts, Broadway wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big D was pivotal in the people are
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a controversial statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: D I love you got nothing but love and
respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: D was pivotal, pivotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes the new row ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, D was a huge part in the evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pioneering of concentrates in
Colorado, especially the Denver area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he revolutionized, pioneered
concentrate making, selling dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: operating the way shit was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lot of influence on the industry
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't agree with that, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email grow from your heart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: D's a conference con controversial dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got nothing but love for the big
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, keep taking care of yourself,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, we're at this cannabis cup event
and we're walking around and we decide
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's time to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get in line for a dab at the
Broadway wellness booth at that booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy known as big D was working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him several times, uh,
and magazines on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media was banging for the weed
scene at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before they took down all of the
weed content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do dab wars on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we would tap tab it, uh, hashtag it,
uh, dab wars, uh, attack of the dabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of us were taking gigantic dabs and
being, being silly on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I digress and I kind of lost where I
was, where the fuck was I big D at
[SPEAKER_00]: Broadway wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew we'd get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get in line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who big D is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, do you want a big dab or a
little dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, uh, no, I didn't even hit
it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the girl that was with me,
she got in front and he's like big dab or
[SPEAKER_00]: a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she takes a little tiny dab D heats up
what is known as a swing arm skill at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little piece of titanium that
swings up and you heat that and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: swings down and it attaches to a piece of
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like it goes into the bong and
comes out like a bong stem would,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it comes down, it curves downward
and has a bell that would flare out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's shaped like an umbrella or a bell
and a swing arm swings underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: opening of the bell to absorb the smoke so
that you could inhale through the smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the smoke through the bong,
which this piece is attached to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a little, like a 10 inch tiny bong
with not a big fix, uh, stem on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't get too much smoke in there
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just went straight to your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he heats it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, way too hot back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know yet heated up way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, put the dab on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl that was with me hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went wobbly numb for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to reach underneath her arms and
supporter kind of reach underneath her and
[SPEAKER_00]: hold her up for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause she went wobbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she went kind of frog leg,
kind of fishing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she blew out this cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looked back at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, I need to go sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, let me, let me get,
and she's like, yeah, yeah, you get one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, but I'm going over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she kind of bust out of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had to go sit down and get her shit
together too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a drink, catch your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wow, this looks like a good
fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the rig right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big D drops a fat dab on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm a white guy with dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look like I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got skyrocket high from that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I blew out that smoke, my brain,
it felt like fireworks went out one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rocket ship flew out the other,
but then it also felt like I shit my pants
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things were happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in, it was heaven and hell at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was so high that I was like,
am I, am I having a stroke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I dying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this living?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wasn't sure what the fuck was
really happening from that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that I loved it because before
we left that event, I went back and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the exact rigs that I hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought one of the exact torches he
used to heat that bitch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought a bunch of concentrates from
everywhere I could find at that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from then we started dabbing heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that will lead me into another great
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my evolution of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it all began.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite stories to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a short podcast actually,
cause this camera is telling me that the
[SPEAKER_00]: battery is low and it was at a hundred
percent when I started 22 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care about the tech issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third dab story on the 709 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross Jeff telling stories today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather around you guys at story time with
Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was in this story?
[SPEAKER_00]: This story starts off with Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Kevin was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't seen Kevin in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you were well, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike may have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Mike was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure Wade may have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there were probably six or seven
people in my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called a bunch of people over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey guys, I got a new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show off and I want to get
everybody skyrocket high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did at this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole crew came over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my girlfriend at the time might've
been there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a bunch of concentrates on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lined up dabs for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all took a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all leaned back in our chair for about
10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody kind of one at a time decided I
got to go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Tony was there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't seen you in a while, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody decided, man, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all just got up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just left quietly and people are
like, I got to go take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go get food.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just disappeared off the couches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly laid the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about a six hour nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I woke up, everybody started
texting about the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, bro, did you fall asleep,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you eat all of the food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wrecked everybody that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time we got the
whole group over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super, super baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole iry crew, the original iry
genetics, iry army crew got lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that day pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll miss you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to be in that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that was when I killed the entire
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets us into my first,
second, third dab story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three good stories is enough for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit more about the
actual evolution of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when we started this, uh, the BHO
concentrates, we were open blasting in
[SPEAKER_00]: enclosed places with PVC tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a concentrate maker or a
concentrate consumer, all of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: are completely absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not be open blasting,
which is if you don't know what that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, you're going, oh man,
I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's just blasting cans of butane
haphazardly through a PVC tube stuffed
[SPEAKER_00]: with concentrates to make or stuffed with
weed to make concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PVC leeches, you get gases and shit
from the PVC and your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be open blasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said in enclosed spaces,
that's how shit blows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know several people that are scarred
from head to toe, uh, don't have any hair
[SPEAKER_00]: on their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have any eyebrows and eyelashes
because they were making butane
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from doing that in the backyard
with shitty equipment into having
[SPEAKER_00]: professional amazing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not overlook a bunch of the
steps that it took to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from, like I said, open blasting
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally went outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned how to get better equipment,
safer, more sterile equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started learning about science and
reading science and, uh, chemistry papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we started getting vac ovens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started getting vacuum ovens and
learning how to properly purge the BHO
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, the game changed forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can make better concentrates more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Batches could be larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, production stepped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality stepped up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then it became an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the term extract artist became super
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in Colorado, everybody in
California, you were either a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeder, or an extract artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were all of the fucking above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, making extracts and concentrates was
huge for a little while there when those
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum ovens became popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then, uh, does anybody remember
mystery oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got mystery oils written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go faster because that camera is
losing battery rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we need to get another camera and
figure out some shit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, remember mystery oil, you guys,
if you're around for mystery oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started making butane and when we
started purging properly, uh, we started
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering a weird layer of oils on top
of our concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know if it was coming from the
plants itself, pesticides or something
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the big question was, is it coming from
the butane cans which we are buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later we discovered, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming from the cans of butane,
which we were buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people were curious about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us probably smoked a lot of that
shit, didn't know it, didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still have no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why I twitch when I wake up
in the mornings, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we got much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned to purge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got vac ovens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered mystery oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystery oil was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our concentrates went from black poop
soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to call things poop soup and tain
soup, uh, butane soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd take a dab of it and you'd put it on
somebody's nail or your nail and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: sparkle and it would make a stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now concentrates, they burn smooth and
they vaporize and they disappear cleanly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random side notes from Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody ever offers you a dab,
a puff of a concentrate, or even some
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that you don't want to smoke,
my way of diverting that conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: politely avoiding that is I go,
oh man, that looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try some of what I got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bust out mine and it always
diverts the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to smoke their dabs or
their flowers if it looks questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand sometimes I don't want to
smoke, uh, certain concentrates that I see
[SPEAKER_00]: that certain people bring around.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to anybody, but some of your
concentrate looks like complete shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put my lungs,
my health, my body at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also, ew, I just don't want to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you can't avoid smoking other
people's nasty poop soup, their tain crap,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, their, their butane batter just by
saying, Oh, check this out, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: and show it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you both take a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you still have a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they're really insistent,
you can be like, Oh man, I'm high after
[SPEAKER_00]: the dab I took.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just keep making excuses all
day, but you could politely tactfully
[SPEAKER_00]: dodge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a couple of excuses for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get my high rambly ass back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we went from poop soup to the stuff
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you guys, we had, um, stuff would come
out liquidy and goopy and the wrong color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started to shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had concentrates called shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to say, if it don't shatter,
it don't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we realized a lot of the shatter
was lipids and things that we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started learning that you
could whip it and turn it into a batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like a nice batter, especially a
live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you fresh freeze it,
then extract it, then make a batter out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like a batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's very terpy, has a lot of
terpenes, a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that the feeling in the
lungs is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had goop and then we had shatter,
then we had batter, then we had wax,
[SPEAKER_00]: people learned how to make it into a waxy
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I really liked the wax,
you'd get a big old glob of wax and heat
[SPEAKER_00]: up the dab nail, and just press the wax
right into the dab nail and smoke as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as you want all in one big rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty fun to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had crumble stuff that would just fall
apart and crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different textures of
concentrates and so many different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got regionally it got known as a lot of
different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you could go from Pueblo to Denver
up to Boulder and the same shit would be
[SPEAKER_00]: called something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd find earwax in different places,
it'd be called crumble in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell why it's called earwax,
a lot of chunk of goopy earwax and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a concentrate that looked like
that whatever color that shit is that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a concentrate that looked like
that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've gotten better and cleaner
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got diamonds and sauce and live
rosins and live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can basically, I'm not a
Scientologist, I'm not a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: maker, I'm not an extraction nearest in
any way, but now I understand that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: basically extract and divide any of the
components of the plant which we so
[SPEAKER_00]: desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull out the terpenes in one
container, we can pull out the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in another container,
we can pull out the pesticides in another
[SPEAKER_00]: container, and isolate all of those
components of the cannabis plant is where
[SPEAKER_00]: this evolution has gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are making big diamonds out of
straight THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 99.9% THCA and that 1% is just
atmospheric allowances.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be oxygen and some moisture
and shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can also make the same thing with
CBD crystals and isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy 99% cannabis derived terpenes
and you can mix your own crystals and your
[SPEAKER_00]: own terpenes together and make your own
ratios to the amount that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to really love the diamonds,
but I like the buzz, but I feel like when
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke those diamonds without enough
terps, the THC just makes me go real high
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute and there's no fun to the
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm really high, but no,
I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the terps really give a color
to the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my buzz was a firework, the THC makes
me fly up in the air and then the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: are the color of my buzz and those
crystals don't have any color to them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the buzz, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get you real high, make your chest
feel weird, get your heart racing,
[SPEAKER_00]: make your blood sugar do weird shit,
but I'm not a big fan of the high without
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of backup into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I feel like this is my
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've ever said this on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've said this in previous
Instagram live videos and other weird
[SPEAKER_00]: rambles where I have appeared,
but here is a prediction that I do see
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't already exist in there,
Babylon is just keeping it from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big conspiracy, but really this is
what I do see coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, I think that each patient,
consumer, either recreational or medically
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to walk into maybe a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might just be your normal store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to do this at Starbucks,
but I would like to be able to walk into a
[SPEAKER_00]: place and I can hand them my card and my
card has my preferred mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds crazy, but when we get there
together, you're going to go, I want this
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine when you go, when we were a kid
and we would go to Roundtable Pizza is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I went, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a crazy flashback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see it happen in my face?
[SPEAKER_00]: Roundtable Pizza was the pizza place near
me and they had all of the soda machines
[SPEAKER_00]: in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get Coke, Diet Coke,
Cherry Coke, fucking vanilla Coke,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsi tea, Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fucking other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some Fanta, some Dr. Pepper,
maybe even some lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what the fuck else they had on
that row of fucking sugary diabetes
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks, but you could go make your,
we call it a suicide, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put, if you put Sprite in the
suicide, you're fucking it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put all the darkest colors,
the cherry, the Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd make the most disgusting concoctions
of sugar and syrup you could out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you could walk into a dispensary,
a turp bucks, a dab bucks, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could hand them your card and that
card said, my preferred slurry is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you drop that card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just swipe it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in to a machine and the machine
says, oh, Rasta Jeff is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is this, let's say 50% THC a,
because I like to get real high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's put, uh, and I'm just making up
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I'm creating this as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come live it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My card says that I want 50% THC a in my
slurry, zero CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't fuck with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ruins my buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I want a little bit of pining in there
and let's put some mercy in there just to
[SPEAKER_00]: kick it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't know what other
cannabinoids, palliates, and esters we
[SPEAKER_00]: could add to that yet, but in the future,
science will know what things we can add
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're just going to put some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll just add weird components of
other shit in there that are organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help that buzz affect me the way
that I need to for my medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got a two or three recipes on a
card that I can just swipe this card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can set my settings on my phone
and say, I want to get high as fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: where when I smoke this concentrate
fireworks go off in my brain and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: levitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe I've got another one that I
can go to my phone and say, I need to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a fucking nap, knock me out, put me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make two different concentrates,
swipe my card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spits both of them out, puts a label on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is 50% THC, a bunch of limonene,
some linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one over here is all sleepy time
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that would be for my
body, but that's in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spits them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charges my card, sends me home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to go take dabs of rosted Jeff's
custom slurry concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine walking around with your own
vape pen with your custom slurry or your
[SPEAKER_00]: own dab rig and hitting your own custom
slurry and then your friends got their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like mixing jelly bellies and finding
your flavors or mixing up fucking sodas
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that's the way of the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to see in cannabis in
concentrate development, improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now I love the textures,
the batters, the butters, the sauces,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes cannot be beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis concentrates, the flavors are at
an all time peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some GMO concentrates and some
garlic banger concentrates that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: open the jar, it is almost disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost vile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost makes you go, and then you want
to you take a dab of it and you blow it
[SPEAKER_00]: out and your mouth has this like burnt
rubber rotten eggs, gas and skunk thing on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, that's disgustingly delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have another dab of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes have never been stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning how to preserve the terps
in the grow and the drying cure or the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest process, even if there's no drying
cure, and then also in the concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: production and then in the preservation of
those concentrates, the transport those
[SPEAKER_00]: jars have to get from one facility to
another and stay fresh and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy it and get it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're learning a lot about
preservation of terpenes and these
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we got enough battery to keep
talking, we can make a podcast out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolution of the gear and the actual
dab I mentioned before that we had this
[SPEAKER_00]: swing arm skillet before we were just
stuffing concentrates on top of weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it like that I didn't have a real
dab pen or a real concentrate device that
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the swing arm skillet that was
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except sometimes the dabs would roll off
the skillet under your fucking leg or onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the table or you got hot oil and you're
like that shit sucked that time period
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was sticky and shit sucked
torches have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to torch the nail you got to torch
the skillet torch companies and torches
[SPEAKER_00]: have come a long way big up to all the
torch companies that tortured us and
[SPEAKER_00]: helped improve us along the way nails dab
nails have come a long way back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: we used a big ass metal nail some crap
metal then it was titanium big big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to our friends task rock and highly
educated titanium task changed the game
[SPEAKER_00]: then we went from titanium everybody
switched over to quartz bangers then from
[SPEAKER_00]: the banger everybody switched over to the
new Terp slurper things have really
[SPEAKER_00]: changed quickly there also there are
emails oh let's talk about the torch and
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature you guys do I have that
written down that's coming up yeah we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that next then we got emails
instead of heating up the nail all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time we found an email we could set at the
right temperature and hit that shit all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long then we got a puff Co we started
getting electronic devices the puff Co's
[SPEAKER_00]: dab pins then things went crazy from there
now the options for smoking are fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: endless one thing I forget to talk about
is the Atmos raw vape uh there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: little device that I watched ruin people's
lives you would put concentrates in a one
[SPEAKER_00]: dram or a half dram glass vial it sounds
like drugs already it looked like fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs you'd screw it into this little
metal pipe it was an aluminum apparatus
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically was big enough for your
hand to hold and then you would slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: heat that glass vial that had the
concentrates in there with a small torch
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would inhale it looked and felt a
lot like you were doing drugs you really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to get caught doing but the
dabs or the dry dabs it wasn't a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was just a straight dry vapor
rip from hot hot concentrates through a
[SPEAKER_00]: metal pipe and a glass vial the rips you
would get from that could ruin your
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend you would cough so hard your lung
would come out of one side your esophagus
[SPEAKER_00]: would pop out snot would come out of your
eye and tears would come out of your nose
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a fucked up delicious experience I
watched people throw up from that thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: watched people pass out from it I got so
high it was beautifully uncomfortable that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing would ruin people so the atmosphere
I think it was called the atmosphere no
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a different device that was this
was not the atmosphere you guys I was
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong when I said that what was that
fucking thing called it was metal I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: one somewhere I don't know what it's
called that thing would just fucking ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: people's days it was metal might have been
the cloud V it wasn't that either there
[SPEAKER_00]: were so many apparatus and devices is we
went through I did say devices is on
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose I was trying to be Bobby Lee um if
you think what that metal fucking thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: called in a vial screwed into and you heat
up the vial and smoke concentrates through
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll try to find mine it's in a box
somewhere I'll post a picture of it if I
[SPEAKER_00]: can find it that that thing used to fuck
me up how are we doing on battery all
[SPEAKER_00]: right we're doing good we are well um
eventually we learned not to heat the dab
[SPEAKER_00]: nail into oblivion like we were trying to
reshape the fucking thing for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: there we thought the hotter the dab nail
the better the dab then we learned the
[SPEAKER_00]: term was you got to waste it to taste it
we developed a thing called a carb cap we
[SPEAKER_00]: did not shout out to my buddy task rock
task rock is who I know for pioneering the
[SPEAKER_00]: carb cap it was a device that would go
over your dab nail that would trap the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and oxygen inside the dab nail and
limit oh man we used to have domes too we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even talk about domes on the dab
rig we skipped that how old-school are you
[SPEAKER_00]: if she doesn't know what a dome on a dab
nail is she's not old enough for you bro
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway we're gonna skip right over the
domes you guys know what those were it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a dome to go over the dab nail so that the
air didn't get old the smoke didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: away trap the air eventually we went to a
domeless nail then we went to a carb cap
[SPEAKER_00]: when we started putting the carb cap on it
would trap the heat inside the nail and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would trap it would minimize the flow of
oxygen which would create a vacuum on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the nail and give you a much
larger smoother burning dab a better
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate a better vaporization if you
will without as much heat which gave you a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger better dab without roasting your
lungs which got me higher it got me less
[SPEAKER_00]: lung pain and it tasted so much better so
we learned the term was taste it to waste
[SPEAKER_00]: it because the cooler dabs low temp dabs
tend to taste a little bit better because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not burning off those turps so over
time we learn to adjust and control our
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures a little bit better I still
go a little hot I kind of like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit hot but we have learned quite a bit
the word used to be glowy's we used to do
[SPEAKER_00]: red hot dabs and call them glowy's it'd be
glowy's for Harambe glowy's for Jesus
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever it was for that day but we would
do glowy's back in the day and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hurt my lungs are probably still
burned up from a couple of hot hot glowy's
[SPEAKER_00]: then I forgot about ninja dabs bro ninja
dabs are not on the notes but a ninja dab
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm taking a dab right nice and
peacefully right we're gonna act like this
[SPEAKER_00]: is my dab tool I'm gonna take a dab on the
microphone here I'll look into this camera
[SPEAKER_00]: as I do it but I got my dab I'm nice and
ready right as soon as I get my dab to the
[SPEAKER_00]: device one of my asshole friends reaches
in with guess what another dad and doubles
[SPEAKER_00]: up my fucking dab now I'm doing two dabs
didn't expect to do two dabs that's called
[SPEAKER_00]: the ninja dab now I'm gonna be double high
I'm gonna cough twice as hard it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a dick move but also thanks for the dab
bro another thing that I used to do I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to set time bombs what the fuck is a time
bomb I would put another dab underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: the carb cap so that I wouldn't even have
to ninja dab you you would ninja dab
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself you would take a dab and then
you'd grab the carb cap and you'd set the
[SPEAKER_00]: carb cap on the nail this is my nail right
here for now for this the sake of movie
[SPEAKER_00]: magic here you'd be doing your dab then
you'd set your carb cap on there and you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: get more dabs and you'd be like what the
why is it smokier than ever and now you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do two dabs and you only expected
one you just got time bombed or booby
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped what's wrong with the dab booby
trap who doesn't want an extra dab maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you don't want an extra dab but
sorry dude you were at Rasta Jeff's house
[SPEAKER_00]: you got another dab you're gonna be okay
we got cookies and cable everything will
[SPEAKER_00]: be alright alright let me get my high ass
back on track I do have some notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're running out of time the battery is
descending quickly um bro we went from
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking goop and crap and questionable
shit shit that I was like oh I paid money
[SPEAKER_00]: for this at a fucking dispensary I bought
this dark brown shit that smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt sulfur and it tastes like fish guts
when I smoke it to now we're smoking live
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin live batters the best concentrates
on the planet through high-end quartz at
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct temperature with the fucking
thermometer in the dab nail and tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just the right temperature we are
spoiled now things have come a long way
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to say how grateful I am how uh
that's the word dude I am so grateful I am
[SPEAKER_00]: spoiled I love I really enjoy taking dabs

[SPEAKER_00]: really uh seems to keep me calm and
